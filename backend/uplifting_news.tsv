Al Franken Of Inappropriate Touching#Two more women have told HuffPost that Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) touched their butts in separate incidents. These are the third and fourth such allegations against Franken in the past week. Leeann Tweeden, a radio host, wrote last week that Franken had kissed and groped her without her consent during a 2006 USO tour. On Monday, Lindsay Menz accused Franken of groping her at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010.

The two additional women, who said they were not familiar with each others’ stories, both spoke on condition of anonymity. But their stories, which describe events during Franken’s first campaign for the Senate, are remarkably similar — and both women have been telling them privately for years.

In a statement to HuffPost, Franken said, “It’s difficult to respond to anonymous accusers, and I don’t remember those campaign events.”

The first woman, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity because she’s worried she’ll be harassed online for making the allegation, said Franken groped her when they posed for a photo after a June 25, 2007, event hosted by the Minnesota Women’s Political Caucus in Minneapolis.

“My story is eerily similar to Lindsay Menz’s story,” the first woman said. “He grabbed my buttocks during a photo op.”

The second woman told HuffPost that Franken cupped her butt with his hand at a 2008 Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis, then suggested the two visit the bathroom together. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear that the allegation could affect her position at work.

“My immediate reaction was disgust,” the second woman said. “But my secondary reaction was disappointment. I was excited to be there and to meet him. And so to have that happen really deflated me. It felt like: ‘Is this really the person who is going to be in a position of power to represent our community?’”

“I can categorically say that I did not proposition anyone to join me in any bathroom,” Franken told HuffPost.

‘We Stood Next To Each Other ... And Down His Hand Went’

The first woman, a 38-year-old book editor who was living in Minneapolis at the time, told HuffPost that she had just finished performing with a feminist choir at the Women’s Political Caucus event, which Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, attended. After the ceremony, she and other members of the choir approached him for photos.

“My mother loves Al Franken. She listened to Air America [on which Franken had a radio show] every day,” the first woman said. ”I saw him and asked if we could take a photo together for my mother, and we stood next to each other ... and down his hand went.”

HuffPost spoke to two sources close to the first woman who corroborated her account.

One fellow choir member, Sarah, remembers not only being there for the groping incident but hearing another choir member say that Franken wouldn’t stop looking at her chest.

Ten years ago, it was easier to shrug off predatory behavior as “boys being boys,” Sarah said, especially when that predatory behavior came from a political ally.

“At the time ... people weren’t as willing to speak against people they felt like were on their side,” Sarah said. “It’s really disappointing. And it’s crappy. Ten years ago we were also at an age where there was still a feeling of powerlessness, or that boys will be boys.”

People are saying that this is a right-wing conspiracy. It’s not. I’m a liberal person. ... I voted for him after this happened.

The first woman’s best friend, who likewise wished to remain anonymous, remembers hearing about the groping incident the day after it happened.

“She was in this all-women’s choir and he was at an event where she performed, and she told me that he basically grabbed her ass,” the best friend said. “It was a ‘Can you believe this happened to me?’ kind of thing.”

The first woman wanted to tell her story because Franken is “a serial groper,” she said.

“Only two people have come forward, and people are saying that this is a right-wing conspiracy,” she said. “It’s not. I’m a liberal person. ... I voted for him after this happened.”

‘I Was Completely Mortified’

The second woman, who said she was groped at a fundraiser, told HuffPost it took place in the fall of 2008 at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis. She was excited about attending the event and meeting someone she wanted to support.

“I had never attended anything like that,” she said.

She and her friends found Franken and introduced themselves to him.

“I shook his hand, and he put his arm around my waist and held it there,” the second woman said. “Then he moved it lower and cupped my butt.”

“I was completely mortified,” she added.

In order to escape the situation, the woman excused herself to go to the bathroom. At that point, she said, Franken leaned in and suggested that he accompany her. She grabbed her friend and fled to the bathroom without him.

The second woman told several people ― including one of the reporters for this story, Zachary Roth ― about the incident some years ago, but didn’t want it reported then. She said she didn’t tell anyone at the time of the incident because inappropriate behavior from men was not that unusual to her or her friends.

“Sexual harassment happens so often, you have to learn how to move on,” she said, describing her thinking at the time.

Several other factors also left her feeling powerless.

“I felt like I didn’t have a voice,” she said. “This man had all of the power, all of the authority. In addition, he is a white man and I am a woman of color. I was 21 years old. And I was afraid that he would use all of those privileges to discredit me, to make me feel even smaller than I already felt.”

Today, she said, she feels more confident, in part thanks to the flood of women who have come forward over the last month to share stories of sexual harassment by powerful men.

“I couldn’t see all these other women come forward and not walk the walk myself,” she said. “I wanted my report to be a way for other women to say, ‘Yes, that happened to me and I don’t have to be afraid.’”

Like the second woman, the first woman waited years before deciding to go public with her story.

She laughed off the incident at the time, she said, even telling other people about it as a sort of “party trick.” It wasn’t until recently, she said, that she felt safe talking about how uncomfortable she’d felt.

Facebook

On Oct. 12, shortly after The New York Times and The New Yorker published bombshell reports about sexual assault claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that drove the #MeToo social media campaign to new heights, the first woman posted on Facebook about her experience.

“Are we all sharing which famous man has groped us?” she wrote. “Mine’s Al Franken.”

“Men should be held to the same standards regardless of their politics,” she said. “He’s an imperfect messenger for a progressive platform. He can’t claim to be ‘for women’ and also grope them.”$http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jim-kenney-donald-trump-philadelphia-mayor_us_5a168defe4b0d4906cad5ebf?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009#Philadelphia Mayor Roasts Donald Trump: ‘Our President Is A Bully’ And A 'Punk’#Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney did not hold back in his criticism of President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

During a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall, Kenney called out the White House for having “no compassion whatsoever” with its decision to remove the “temporary protected status” designation for Haitians by July 2019.

The status gives people from certain war-ravaged or natural disaster-hit countries permission to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. Haiti was left devastated by an earthquake in 2010.

The Trump administration’s move, announced Monday, would force almost 59,000 Haitians to either achieve legal status in the U.S., return home, leave for another country or remain in America without documentation.

Kenney called Trump’s immigration policies “simply un-American” and said the president himself should “get out” of the country.

“I’m just beside myself with with sadness because our president is a bully, our president is a punk and he just doesn’t get it,” he added.$http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/heres-what-spreadsheet-phil-should-have-done-for-a-truly-radical-budget_uk_5a15d1b2e4b0f401dfa7ecdfHere's What 'Spreadsheet Phil' Should Have Done For A Truly Radical BudgetMany commentators have already concluded that ‘Spreadsheet Phil’ did the best he could with a bad hand in this week’s Budget.

It’s true that the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was able to produce a few headline-grabbing giveaways, especially around housing, an issue which the Prime Minister has pledged to take “personal charge” of solving. Cue an apparent injection of £44bn into housebuilding designed to see 300,000 new homes per year delivered by the middle of the next decade.

And those looking to buy a home received the welcome news that purchases below £300,000 will no longer attract Stamp Duty. Elsewhere, largesse was more muted. An extra £2.8bn for the NHS was almost immediately criticised by health service bosses as woefully inadequate and jarred next to the £3bn set aside to deal with Brexit-related costs. The irony will not have been lost.

But try as he might, the Chancellor found it impossible to hide from the swingeing downgrades to the UK’s economic growth prospects from the oft-labelled “independent” Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR laid the blame for the slowdown in Britain’s GDP rises over the coming years on sluggish productivity, which is set to hit tax revenues.

And even the more positive mood-music on housing quickly came under attack, with experts suggesting the main effect of the cut in Stamp Duty will be further house price rises – potentially wiping out any theoretical savings from the tax cut.

While an expansion in housing supply, plus other measures to encourage NHS bodies and councils to free up surplus land for brownfield development, may (on an optimistic outlook) start to have an effect in a few years, the fact is housing affordability will remain a huge challenge for most people for the foreseeable future.

According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, the poorest fifth of households spend around a third (31%) of their income on housing costs, compared to less than one tenth (9%) for the richest fifth. Worryingly, this proportion has been rising consistently for those least able to afford it for the past 15 years.

This is perhaps no surprise given the explosion in those housed in the private rented sector over that time: between 2002 and 2015, the numbers of households in this category grew from 2.3m to 5.4m – 21% of all families. And all too often, high rents on top of low wages become a trap: Research by Shelter has found that typical new homes built today are out of reach for over eight in ten (83%) working families living in private rented accommodation across the country – even if they use the Government’s Help to Buy scheme.

Recently, the Institute for Global Prosperity put forward a radical new proposal to overhaul our public services and make them fit for the 21st century. We’ve called this idea ‘Universal Basic Services’, or UBS. At its heart is a simple premise: that the services all of us need for a minimum standard of living in modern Britain – shelter, food, transport and information technology – should be provided free at the point of need, just as we already do for healthcare through the NHS. The main benefit of this scheme is that it would dramatically reduce the basic cost of living for many millions of people; for the poorest people in society, it would be worth around £125 per week in saved costs.

On housing, we’ve recommended doubling the existing social housing stock by funding the building of 1.5 million new social housing units by borrowing at the current low rates. The new units would be offered on a needs basis at zero rent. All social housing would be exempted from Council Tax, and include a utilities allowance.

Now of course, this has prompted some accusations that such a plan can’t be afforded in our current circumstances. But our proposals are fully costed. In the document we published back in October, economists Jonathan Portes and Howard Reed have shown how the £42bn total cost of UBS represents the equivalent of just 2.3% of UK GDP and could be paid for by reducing the Personal Allowance.

We’ve also been at pains to point out that the idea for UBS would need to be accompanied by a big expansion of local democracy and accountability, to prevent the creation of new, clunky state monopolies on service provision.

But the fundamental question at stake here needs to be asked: What kind of society do we want Britain to be? Do we want to continue down the path of growing inequality and insecurity we’ve witnessed over the past decade? Or is it time for a new social contract that ensures everyone has the building blocks they need to live a ‘larger life’?0
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/23/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-rolls-on-with-balloons-bands-security.htmlMacy's Thanksgiving Day Parade rolls on with balloons, bands, securityThe Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade marched, rolled and soared in traditional style Thursday as police went all-out to secure it in a year marked by attacks on outdoor gathering spots.

With new faces and old favorites in the lineup, the Americana extravaganza made its way through 2 ½ miles of Manhattan on a cold morning.

"The crowds are still the same, but there's a lot more police here. That's the age we live in," Paul Seyforth said as he attended the parade he'd watched since the 1950s.

"Not a lot's changed — the balloons, the bands, the floats — and that's the good thing," said Seyforth, 76, who'd flown in from Denver to spend his 50th wedding anniversary in New York and see this year's parade.

The televised parade was proceeding smoothly, though about midway through, a gust of wind on a largely calm day blew a candy-cane balloon into a tree branch, and it popped near the start of the route on Manhattan's Upper West Side. No one was injured.

In 2005, one of the parade's signature giant balloons caught a gust, hit a Times Square lamppost and injured two people. The candy cane was smaller than the giant balloons.

NYPD TO USE SECRET WEAPON AT THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE: 'VAPOR WAKE' RETRIEVERS

Timothy McMillian and his wife, their 9-year-old daughter and his in-laws started staking out a spot along the route at 6:30 a.m. They'd come from Greensboro, North Carolina, to see in person the spectacle they'd watched on TV for years.

McMillian, a 45-year-old schoolteacher, booked a hotel months ago, but he started to have some concerns about security when a truck attack on a bike path near the World Trade Center killed eight people on Halloween.

"With the event being out in the open like this, we were concerned," he said. "But we knew security would be ramped up today, and we have full confidence in the NYPD."

Authorities say there is no confirmation of a credible threat to the parade, but they were taking no chances after both the truck attack and the October shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival.

New York Police Department officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors were circulating among the crowds, sharpshooters were on rooftops and sand-filled city sanitation trucks were poised as imposing barriers to traffic at every cross street. Officers also were escorting each of the giant balloons.

The mayor and police brass have repeatedly stressed that visitors shouldn't be deterred. And Bekki Grinnell certainly wasn't.

THIS THANKSGIVING, HOUSTON'S HURRICANE HARVEY HERO, MATTRESS MACK, TO FEED THOUSANDS

"When your kid from Alaska is marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, you come," said Grinnell, whose daughter was marching with the band from Colony High School in Palmer, Alaska. Grinnell said she wasn't worried about security because of the police presence: "I think we're in a safe spot."

Other paradegoers also showed their appreciation for police: The NYPD marching band and a group of mounted officers got some of the biggest cheers from spectators lined up as many as 15 deep along barricades. Among other crowd favorites: as did the SpongeBob SquarePants balloon.

The 91st annual parade featured new balloons including Olaf from the Disney movie "Frozen" and Chase from the TV cartoon "Paw Patrol" will be among the new balloons Thursday, along with a new version of the Grinch of Dr. Seuss fame.

Smokey Robinson, The Roots, Flo Rida and Wyclef Jean were among the stars celebrating, along with performances from the casts of Broadway's "Anastasia," ''Dear Evan Hansen" and "SpongeBob SquarePants." The lineup included a dozen marching bands, as well as the high-kicking Radio City Music Hall Rockettes — and, of course, Santa Claus.

"This is my favorite thing ever," musician Questlove told The Associated Press as he got ready to ride the Gibson Guitars float with his bandmates in The Roots and late-night host Jimmy Fallon of "The Tonight Show," where The Roots are the house band. Questlove said being in the parade is "probably my favorite perk" of the job.

"To go from being a spectator to being up here, it's kinda cool," he said.

Added singer-songwriter Andy Grammer as he got on the Homewood Suites float: "It's kind of like being at the center of Thanksgiving."1

http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-machine-learning-quick-explainer-2017-11So, what is machine learning anyways? Here's a quick breakdownIf you're keeping up to date on technology news, you're probably seeing references to machine learning everywhere, and for good reason: machine learning is an integral component of the way that computers process information. Machine learning is all around us, informing our day to day lives from the way we navigate Google maps right down to the way we check our inboxes. But what is it exactly, and when did it start being such a big deal? Here's a quick explainer to get you up to date: View As: One Page Slides

There have been two especially important developments in the history of machine learning: the first began with artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel, who coined the term "machine learning" back in 1959. In 1959, MIT engineer Arthur Samuel described machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Samuel was busy creating his own computing machine: an autonomous checker program that he envisioned would someday beat the top world checker player champion.

The other important development in machine learning? The internet. The advent of the internet presented a trove of accumulated data. With so much information readily available, there seemed but one thing to do: figure out a way to organize it into meaningful patterns — one of machine learning's most integral roles.

Big data is the fundamental building block of machine learning. Big data, is, essentially, exactly what it's called: a ton of data. It's all of the information accrued by social media companies, search engines, and even microphones and cameras that are constantly collecting information.

Algorithms sort through this vast collection of information so that technology can predict what we'll do next. Vast amounts of data inform machine learning algorithms, equipping technology with methods of predicting future patterns. These algorithms provide a way to forecast future behavior and anticipate forthcoming problems. One of the best-known examples of this is Amazon's suggested product feature. It reads your preferences and the buying habits of other people, and then recommends other products you might be interested in.

Machine learning is all about sorting through those troves of collected information to discern patterns and predict new ones. Machine learning differs from human learning, insofar as the machine only knows what you tell it: A computer can't express curiosity or make inferences. For example, if you watch a lot of scifi movies on Netflix, you might find Stranger Things in your suggestion queue. But it's only a matter of math, based on Netflix's data alone — if you've never told Netflix that you love documentaries, or rated one highly, the system will likely never show you one.

But current day iterations of machine learning have radically evolved since the 1600s. Today, machines can learn with only minimal human intervention. Through machine learning, technologists have mimicked the way the human brain works by producing sophisticated systems called neural networks. In turn, neural networks enable deep learning, an outcome that has produced computer systems superseding human intelligence.

Machine learning plays a key role in the development of artificial intelligence. A.I. and machine learning are often conflated, but they're not the same thing. Artificial intelligence refers to a machine's ability to perform intelligent tasks, whereas machine learning refers to the automated process by which machines weed out meaningful patterns in data. Without machine learning, artificial intelligence as we know it wouldn't be possible.0

http://www.businessinsider.com/the-economic-cost-of-brexit-in-gdp-2017-11£72 BILLION: The cost of Brexit is already turning Britain into a second-rung nationBrexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost economic activity annually, according to an analysis of government figures.

Leaving the EU is already dragging down the British economy.

The UK is now growing more slowly than Japan or Italy.



LONDON — Chancellor Philip Hammond's annual budget, presented yesterday, has finally given Britain the first concrete numbers on the cost of Brexit.

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility published revised GDP growth numbers based on data following the June 2016 referendum. Those new estimates suggest that Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost annual economic activity by 2021, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation.

Previously, the best estimate of the economic damage leaving Europe will inflict on the UK came from a private estimate by one of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis's advisors, of about £22 billion per year, mostly from extra trade tariffs and barriers.

Here are the new GDP charts from the OBR.

They show other major economies such as the US, the EU, and Canada all growing faster now than they were in the six months prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016. Only in the UK has growth slowed, as the pound lost value and investors hit the pause button. Even Japan, an infamous economic basket case hobbled by years of stagnation, is doing better than the UK:

In terms of sequential GDP growth through Q3 2017, Britain now lags France and debt-ridden Italy, too. This chart of OECD data comes from Michael Baxter of Share Centre:

This next chart shows how much we are forecast to lose in GDP activity every year, based on the difference between the OBR's previous estimate in March and its new estimate, from updated post-referendum data:

The Resolution Foundation says the gap will represent a loss of £72 billion in 2021:

"The economy is now expected to be roughly £42 billion smaller at the start of 2022 than was thought back in March. This downgrade comes on top of the deterioration pencilled in after the Brexit vote of June 2016. As such, the latest GDP projections point to an economy that will be £72 billion (or 3.4 percent) smaller in 2021 than had been projected in March 2016."

That's £72 billion in lost jobs, revenues, consumer spending, and so on.

There are other factors at play, of course. A big one is the UK's chronic lack of productivity, exacerbated by its refusal to allow in the young immigrant workers to generate the income tax receipts its ageing population needs to pay for the NHS and its state pensions.

But the OBR's downward revisions from March to November of this year all come in the post-Brexit-vote period, and the only thing of macroeconomic substance that changed between then and now was the realisation that the UK is headed toward hard Brexit rather than a trade deal that would keep the country closely tied to the single market.-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/r-airbus-ceo-questioned-in-kazakh-deal-investigation-reports-2017-11Airbus CEO questioned in Kazakh deal investigation: reportsPARIS (Reuters) - French anti-corruption investigators questioned Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders and three other company executives as witnesses in an investigation centered on the sale of satellites to Kazakhstan in 2010, according to media reports on Thursday.

Enders was interviewed in early October by anti-corruption investigators in Nanterre, close to Paris, as was Chairman Denis Ranque, Mediapart, France Inter and Der Spiegel reported.

Authorities are probing an alleged suspect payment linked to the satellite deal, Mediapart reported, adding that Enders and the other executives were not alleged to have any role in it.

"We have no comment to make other than that we are fully co-operating with authorities," a spokesman for Airbus said.

Enders is grappling with scrutiny over Airbus's sales practices after the company uncovered inaccuracies in its filings to U.S. regulators over arms technology sales. That came on top of existing bribery investigations in France and Britain over the use of middlemen in jetliner sales. [nL8N1N60W2]

France and Germany each hold 11 percent of Airbus.

France's finance minister said recently that Enders had the confidence of Airbus's board, while the German government has also rebuffed speculation about Enders's future.

http://www.businessinsider.com/r-how-princess-of-angola-lost-her-oil-crown-2017-11How 'princess' of Angola lost her oil crownBy Stephen Eisenhammer, Libby George and Dmitry Zhdannikov

LUANDA/LONDON (Reuters) - On Oct. 6, with the dust still settling on Angola's first change of power in 38 years, new President João Lourenço sat down with international oil majors at the presidential palace in Luanda.

The top executives in Angola of Chevron , Total , BP , Eni and Exxon said the oil sector was being devastated by delays in project approvals at Sonangol and a backlog of payments owed by the state oil company, according to four oil industry sources with knowledge of the meeting.

They warned Lourenço that Angola's production would decline from 2019 unless swift action was taken to tackle problems at the firm, which was headed by Isabel dos Santos, daughter of his presidential predecessor, the sources said. They declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.

Six weeks later the president fired dos Santos, Africa's richest woman who is nicknamed the "princess" in Angola.

The oil majors all declined to comment on the meeting. Lourenço's office and Sonangol did not respond to requests for comment.

It was a highly unusual gathering; foreign oil firms operate nearly all of Angola's production and hold huge sway, but meeting the president as a united group was almost unheard of.

The nature of the discussions has not been previously reported. The talks, and subsequent events leading up to dos Santos' dismissal, shed light on the reasons behind her ouster - a decision never officially explained.

They offer new insight into the current state of the most important company in Angola, which relies on oil for a third of its economic output and over 95 percent of exports, and the big challenges facing the new management of the debt-laden firm.

The dismissal also points to the waning power of the dos Santos family, which has dominated Angolan politics and business for decades. Isabel dos Santos' father José Eduardo had ruled the country since 1979, amassing wealth for his relatives who own companies in almost every part of the economy.

'NEAR PARALYSIS'

Billionaire dos Santos, who had been Sonangol chair since June 2016, has said she was in the process of restructuring to root out waste and corruption at a company that was struggling even before oil prices plunged in mid-2014.

Her representatives declined to comment for this story, and instead pointed Reuters to two statements, issued in the days after her exit, when she outlined her achievements including reducing debt to $7 billion from $13 billion, raising annual revenue to $15.6 billion from $14.8 billion and cutting costs.

In her departing speech to staff, she said the company had been "nearly bankrupt" when she took over, devastated by the oil-price collapse. "Memories are short," she added.

However, according to interviews with 10 sources, including the four oil industry sources as well as officials from Sonangol and the government, Lourenço was frustrated with the slow pace of change at the company.

On Oct. 13, a week after meeting the oil majors and 17 days after taking office, the president ordered government ministers, Sonangol and international oil companies to form a 30-day working group to review the state of the industry.

The group's meetings, many of them led by new Secretary of State for Oil Carlos Saturnino, were tense, the sources said. Saturnino, an oil industry veteran, had been fired by dos Santos from his role as head of production and exploration at Sonangol last year when she accused him of gross mismanagement.

Even though dos Santos had launched a turnaround plan, huge hold-ups in the approval of projects were strangling the oil sector, according to the sources. Her board had implemented a system for checking projects submitted by foreign oil companies which in practice exacerbated the problem, they said.

She had also created a gulf between her board and the rest of the company by surrounding herself with foreign consultants, said the people, who declined to be named due to the confidential nature of the industry review and related discussions.

The working group concluded there was "a near paralysis" at Sonangol, according to a government source.

CHINA DEBTS

As the group assessed the state of the industry, Lourenço met with Sonangol's biggest lenders - including the Bank of China, Standard Bank and Standard Chartered - to understand Sonangol's financial situation and secure lower lending rates, according to a source familiar with the talks.

"Lourenço realised Sonangol needs money fast," said the source, adding that the company had been seeking to restructure some payments.

Standard Bank declined to comment, citing client confidentiality, while Standard Chartered and Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.

Sonangol's direct debt to Chinese banks and lending consortia including Chinese banks stood at $3.8 billion at the end of 2016, according to the company's annual report.

Oil industry sources told Reuters this debt now stood at about $3 billion, plus another $3 billion to majors, contractors and traders. Of that, nearly $1 billion is owed to trading firms Trafigura and Vitol under loans guaranteed by oil or product exports, according to a source close to Sonangol.

The government itself also last year took out a further $6.9 billion loan from the China Development Bank that it lent to Sonangol, $3.8 billion of which the firm used to refinance debt, according to an International Monetary Fund report.

Supporters of dos Santos, who are familiar with her work at Sonangol, said the debts dated back to before her tenure. They said the company was now in better financial state. The slow pace of restructuring, they say, was due to the scale of the job and restraints imposed by the state on selling assets.

Her dismissal, according to them, was purely political and part of a campaign by the president against her family.

'GOLDEN GOOSE'

With consensus in government building fast against dos Santos, she responded with a charm offensive.

In London, she met CEOs of major oil companies at an industry conference. On Oct. 18, she did a rare live interview at the Reuters office in the city's Canary Wharf financial district.

In the Reuters interview, she described her relationship with the new president as one of "full alignment". But she gave a hint that her days at Sonangol may be numbered, when asked if she would stay to see through the transformation of the firm.

"Once the foundations have been laid and are right, it doesn't matter who steps in as long as the plan is good," said dos Santos, who has stakes in businesses from telecoms to diamonds.

The charm offensive was too little, too late.

On Nov. 15, dos Santos and most of her board were sacked. She was replaced by the man that had become her nemesis: Saturnino.

Foundations notwithstanding, the new management faces the tasks of getting projects moving again, repaying billions of dollars owed to oil majors, contractors and traders, and servicing billions more dollars of debt owed to Chinese banks.

An executive at Sonangol said a massive round of lay-offs had been delayed until after the election and the task would also now most likely fall to the new team.

Lourenço, however, appeared confident of Sonangol's potential when he attended the board's inauguration on Oct. 16, describing the company as a "golden goose".

"Take good care of her," he said.

http://www.businessinsider.com/mary-claire-king-and-the-impact-brca-genes-had-on-cancer-genetics-2017-11Over a 40-year career, this 'stubborn scientist' helped change the way we think about cancer and geneticsMary-Claire King, a geneticist and professor at the University of Washington, was instrumental in the discovery that changed the way we think about cancer.

Her work with the BRCA1 gene that's associated with breast and ovarian cancer came after decades of research during her more than 40-year career.

In the past few years, the impact of her work has started to be felt by the world as cancer genetic testing becomes more widespread.

You might not know the name Mary-Claire King, but you probably know the result of this scientist's most famous work: the BRCA1 gene that's been critical in fighting breast and ovarian cancer.

A geneticist at the University of Washington, King has spent her 40-year career working to better understand human genetics, especially the codes that make up all of us. Her discoveries helped open entire areas of medicine. But it wasn't until the past few years that the effects of her work started to be widely recognized publicly, sparked in part by actor Angelina Jolie's revelation that she had the "faulty" BRCA1 gene, increasing her risk of cancer.

In 2014, King received a prestigious Lasker award for her work in breast cancer genetics as well as human rights, and in 2016 President Barack Obama acknowledged her work with the the National Medal of Science.

"At a time when most scientists believed that cancer was caused by viruses, she relentlessly pursued her hunch that certain cancers were linked to inherited genetic mutations," Obama said at the ceremony. "This self-described 'stubborn' scientist kept going until she proved herself right."

King's initial work in genetics for her doctoral thesis in 1975 was the discovery that humans and chimpanzees are 99% genetically similar. Later, she analyzed DNA from grandmothers to help reconnect them with their grandchildren who had been kidnapped as part of Argentina's "dirty war." She was also active during the Civil Rights Movement.

"As a scientist, one is a citizen of the world. And as a citizen of the world, you have certain responsibilities" King said of her activism in an interview with the World Science Festival.

Arguably, King's biggest impact resulted from her work pinpointing BRCA1, a gene that's critical in producing proteins that repair damaged DNA.

What we know now, based in part on King's research, is that mutations in the BRCA gene have big implications for a person's cancer risk. The risk of getting breast cancer goes from 7% to an average of 55-65% when you have the BRCA1 or 2 gene mutation, while for ovarian cancer the risk increases from 1% to 30%. Knowing you have one of these genetic tweaks, then, could help doctors make more proactive decisions to treat.

Discovering the genetics of cancer

Back when King started her work in the 1970s, the link between cancer and genetics hadn't been made. The running theory at the time was that cancer was viral.

"I thought genetics, evolutionary biology and statistics might add something to the newly launched War on Cancer. And my closest childhood friend had died of cancer. I wanted to try," she told The New York Times in 2015.

Getting a chance to start that research wasn't easy either. On the week leading up to King getting a grant for her research back in April 1981, her husband left her, her house was burgled, and she had a chance encounter with baseball legend Joe DiMaggio.

Here's her re-telling of the week leading up to her presentation at the National Institutes of Health, which led to the grant.

Finally, after years of figuring out just how genetics and family histories of cancer played a role in cancer risk, in 1990, King found the gene linked to breast cancer and named it BRCA1. After that, there was a race to see who could clone the gene, a move which helped researchers better understand how mutations in the gene led to cancer.

Now, doctors are able to give tests to their patients who might have a family history of cancer, to see if they might be at an increased risk based on BRCA and other mutations that have since been linked to various forms of cancer.

A lasting impact

Color CEO Othman Laraki told Business Insider that King is someone who has a "North Pole," which helps her look at data with clear logic. Color sells hereditary cancer — including BRCA1 and 2 and high cholesterol tests — and works with King, who serves as a collaborator and adviser to the company. Working with her, Laraki said, made sense because of her history in working to establish the connection between cancer and genetics, but also to bring that connection to people.

"She’s one of the people who bridge scientific discovery and the knowledge that enables entire populations," Laraki said.

And that's starting to get even more widespread, especially after a 2013 Supreme Court decision ended the ability to have a patent on the BRCA gene, along with Jolie's diagnosis that spread the word about the gene.

"Mary-Claire King, she's invented something that's almost as relevant a datapoint as your blood pressure," said Feyi Olopade Ayodele, CEO of CancerIQ, a company that builds software to help doctors better understand and access hereditary cancer genetics tests at the preventative level. " That's how impactful genetic testing will be in the future."1

Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high Tuesday above $8,300 per coin.

The coin recovered losses it incurred after a different cryptocurrency announced a $30.9 million hack.

Bitcoin's upward climbed continued unabated Monday morning.

The cryptocurrency blew past Monday's record high of $8,285 to $8,368 Tuesday morning, trading up 1.24%. It gave up some of those gains and was trading at $8,289 just before noon ET.

The coin was sent in a tailspin after news broke that cryptocurrency firm, Tether, was hacked.

Tether, which created a cryptocurrency called USDT that is pegged to the dollar, said in a blog post on Tuesday that "funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker."

The US-based company said $30,950,010 was taken Sunday.

Th news dragged the price of bitcoin down by nearly $450 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk data.0
http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/cryptocurrency-ico-bubble-2017-11-1008932213This is the tech bubble we have been waiting forCNBC screengrab

Smart people like the venture capitalist Bill Gurley are beginning to worry that so-called initial coin offerings are a bubble.

People are investing in bitcoin and other digital coins even though they hold no equity value and offer no claims on any kind of underlying asset.

On that definition, ICOs are actually worse than dot-com stocks in 1999 — at least back then investors owned a piece of a company with a revenue stream.

Crypto bulls keep saying bitcoin is "an established store of value."

The problem is that the value being stored is simply everyone else's agreement that there must be value here. There is no other asset. And that is what a bubble looks like.



The venture capitalist Bill Gurley was recently asked whether he thought cryptocurrency "initial coin offerings" were in a bubble. Billions of dollars have been poured into more than 1,000 new digital coins issued by startups this year. These coins mimic the construction of bitcoin, meaning they can be freely traded on digital exchanges and have no central bank standing behind them.

Gurley had an interesting answer. Yes, he said, ICOs look speculative, because interest rates are so low and "there is nowhere [else] to put money."

"As long as those interest rates stay as low as they are, I think you'll continue to see some form of speculative behaviour, and tech is a great place for speculation," he told CNBC. "Look at what is going on in the ICO market, in cryptocurrencies, and you see that no one is afraid to speculate in this market."

The ICO sector today has one big thing in common with the dot-com bubble of 1999: People are "investing" vast sums of money into "assets" that have no history of producing revenue, and those assets are rising in price only because other people are also pouring money into them.

Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, was launched through an ICO in 2014. Ethereum has risen by over 3,000% against the dollar in 2017, and its success is one of the reasons people are feeling good about crypto right now. But many of the other coins that have sprung up in its wake look a lot more risky.

$200 billion invested in something that cannot be described as an 'asset'

The amount of money being poured into ICOs is vast. As these charts from Goldman Sachs show, ICO investment is now a larger source of new investment money than traditional early-stage VC tech-startup investment:

Goldman SachsThe total market, including bitcoin, is now worth more than $200 billion, or £151 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com:

CoinMarketCap.com

The chart below from Shane Oliver, the chief economist and chief investment officer at AMP Capital, puts bitcoin in historical perspective with other major asset bubbles. The lines on the chart are indexed to make them comparable to one another and show that the rush into bitcoin is roughly comparable to the dot-com bubble in 1999-2000.

AMP Capital

Investing in poker chips, hookers, and a really big fish tank

In an ICO, a company offers to sell digital tokens to fund its business. The tokens (or "coins") may allow the buyer to get a product or service from the new company at a later date. Like bitcoin, their value can go up and down, and they can be bought and sold in an open market. The ownership of the coins is recorded on blockchains, which are secure, open-source ledgers that underpin the currencies and are protected by cryptography.

The bet with an ICO is that a token will rise in value. There are two sources of demand for tokens: from people who need them to redeem services from the company that issued them and from other investors who think the token will rise in price like a stock or a currency.

There is an argument that many ICOs should not be described as "investments" because they do not give buyers actual equity in the companies that offer them, only credit that can be redeemed at a later date. At Ethereum's launch, for instance, the founder Vitalik Buterin made it explicit that Ethereum and its ether currency were not the same as an equity investment:

"Ether is a product, NOT a security or investment offering. Ether is simply a token useful for paying transaction fees or building or purchasing decentralized application services on the Ethereum platform; it does not give you voting rights over anything, and we make no guarantees of its future value."

My favourite example of this phenomenon is the cryptocurrency casino that wants to give buyers nonnegotiable coins that can be gambled inside a hotel that will float in the sea off Macau. The company, Dragon Corp., is literally asking you to "invest" in poker chips.

That isn't even the wildest ICO so far. We have also seen:

Worse than the dot-com bubble of 1999

In some ways, ICOs are worse than dot-com stocks in 1999. At least with a dot-com stock you owned an actual piece of equity in the underlying company (even if, like TheGlobe.com, a failed social-media network, it had revenue of only $780,000 a quarter).

The assets being offered in an ICO aren't backed by an existing revenue stream. Rather, it is a speculative bet on the success of some future product, and you must make that bet before the company has created the product you're buying.

On that measure, dot-com companies actually looked more solid than ICOs. Pets.com actually sold pet food. Boo.com actually sold clothes. There was something there, even if it didn't make profits as a business.

With ICOs you don't even have that. It's a bit like Mark Zuckerberg funding the early days of Facebook by offering you credit for free "likes" instead of common stock.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are Google and Amazon ... ICOs are Pets.com and Boo.com

It's perhaps worth drawing a distinction here between the two big cryptocurrency players, bitcoin and Ethereum, and the thousands of "altcoins" that have been issued this year. Unlike most ICO coins, bitcoin and Ethereum aren't geared toward specific projects. Bitcoin is an all-purpose digital asset, and Ethereum's ether is meant to underpin an all-purpose application platform, which multiple blue-chip companies are looking at using. Bitcoin and Ethereum are useful because they are widely used, like cash. Altcoins, however, are credits for a limited, defined service.

It is obviously not the case that because much of the crypto sphere is a bubble that it is all a bubble. The dot-com bust of 2000 didn't prove that the entire internet was useless — just that it was inflated with immature ideas. Bitcoin and Ethereum may turn out to be the Google and Amazon of crypto, but there will be plenty of altcoin equivalents of Pets.com and Boo.com, too.

Gurley was also asked whether bitcoin was a bubble. He said no. Bitcoin is different, he said.

I don't think it's a fraud.

"I think of it as an incredible store of value in the rest of the world," he said, adding: "I don't think it's a fraud."

At the massive Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal, this year, I heard a version of that phrase a lot: "Bitcoin is an established store of value." It was like a mantra. People said it as if merely repeating it made it truer.

But there is a real problem with that formulation.

A "store of value" is a term used to refer to an asset that can be saved and reliably sold at a later date because it predictably maintains its value over time. Traditional stores of value include money (pounds, euros, and dollars), stocks, bonds, gold, and property. There are many others. These assets "store value" because when you want to exchange them they have most likely retained most of their value or increased it. They achieve this by giving the owner a claim on an underlying asset that has its own use: Money is backed by a central bank guaranteeing its value with actual assets on a balance sheet; stocks offer dividends and future earnings; bonds pay interest; gold can be used for jewelry or manufacturing; and you can live in or rent property until it can be sold.

When the property bubble collapsed in 2008, at least people still owned houses

The problem with bitcoin is that it isn't backed by a useful asset. Its price is set only by supply and demand. That means bitcoin can go to zero, because there are zero assets behind it, if people suddenly agree that bitcoin on its own is worthless.

Stocks, bonds, and houses can collapse in value too, of course. But even when they do, you still own a stock, or a bond, or a house.

In terms of underlying assets, there is no fundamental difference between bitcoin and any of the other cryptocurrency ICOs on the market. Sure, bitcoin is now a few years old, and its price has generally gone up over time. If you bought bitcoin years ago, then it really does feel as if you stored value.

But bitcoin has no houses or stock certificates or interest coupons, and there is no company behind it generating revenue whose profits you might share. And neither do any of the other crypto coins. If these coins — including bitcoin — go to zero, then you own nothing.

This is why the crypto space has so many similar characteristics to 1999. (Take it from me: I lived through 1999, including the worthless stock certificates and the unemployment payments that came after it).

With cryptocurrencies, the value being stored is simply everyone else's agreement that there must be value here. There is no other asset.

And that is what a bubble looks like.-1

Yet four years ago, few people in the NBA could have ever seen this coming. When Antetokounmpo was taken 15th in the 2013 draft, he was lanky forward from Greece few people knew about. The potential was there, but could he put it all together? Now, looking back, 14 teams missed the opportunity to draft a star that has become the clear-cut best player from the draft. Take a look back at the 2013 draft and the 14 players picked before him. View As: One Page Slides

The Cleveland Cavaliers took Anthony Bennett with the No. 1 pick.

Bennett never panned out in the NBA. He played on four teams in four years. He was most recently waived by the Suns in October.

The Orlando Magic took Victor Oladipo with the second pick.

Oladipo now plays for the Indiana Pacers. He has career averages of 16 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game.

The Washington Wizards took Otto Porter Jr. with the third pick.

Porter signed a four-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Wizards this offseason.

The Charlotte Hornets took Cody Zeller with the fourth pick.

Zeller is still with Charlotte today. He has career averages of 8 points and 5 rebounds per game.

The Phoenix Suns took Alex Len with the fifth pick.

Len is still with the Suns and has career averages of 7 points and 6 rebounds per game.

The New Orleans Pelicans took Nerlens Noel with the sixth pick and traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers.

The 76ers traded Noel to the Mavericks last season where he still plays today.

The Sacramento Kings took Ben McLemore with the seventh pick.

After four season with the Kings, McLemore signed with the Memphis Grizzlies this offseason. He has career averages of 9 points and 2 rebounds per game.

The Detroit Pistons took Kentavious Caldwell-Pope with the eighth pick.

Caldwell-Pope joined the Lakers this summer and has averaged 11 points and three rebounds per game over his career.

The Minnesota Timberwolves took Trey Burke with the ninth pick and traded him to the Utah Jazz.

Burke played on two teams in four years and now plays for the Knicks' G-League affiliate.

The Portland Trail Blazers took C.J. McCollum with the 10th pick.

McCollum has become one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, averaging over 20 points per game the last three seasons.

The Philadelphia 76ers took Michael Carter-Williams with the 11th pick.

Despite winning Rookie of the Year, Carter-Williams has hopped around the NBA and now plays for the Hornets.

The Oklahoma City Thunder took Steven Adams with the 12th pick.

Adams is still with the Thunder and has become one of the best defensive centers in the NBA.

The Dallas Mavericks took Kelly Olynyk with the 13th pick, but traded him to the Boston Celtics.

Olynyk played four years with the Celtics and signed a $60 million contract with the Heat this summer.

The Utah Jazz took Shabazz Muhammad with the 14th pick but traded him to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Muhammad is still on the Wolves today.

The Milwaukee Bucks took a risk with the 15th pick, drafting a little-known 19-year-old forward from Greece named Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Antetokounmpo has developed into one of the best players in the NBA and is in the run for MVP this season.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-week-12-picks-against-the-spread-2017-11NFL WEEK 12: Our official predictions for who wins this weekendHappy Thanksgiving! The year's best food-and-football centric holiday also brings a great slate of games to bet on this week. Personally, I am thankful for our picks last week, which went a tidy 8-5-1 against the spread to get us back on the right side of winning. I'm also thankful for home underdogs, double-digit lines, and the Philadelphia Eagles. This week is an interesting one for gamblers, with three of the highest lines of the year on the board, so let's get straight to the bets so we can make some money while we lounge around in a tryptophan haze on Thursday. All lines courtesy of the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook. LAST WEEK: 8-5-1

OVERALL: 81-73-6 View As: One Page Slides

Minnesota Vikings (-3) at Detroit Lions (Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Lions +3 The logic: This is a trap game for the Vikings if I ever saw one. Coming off a big win against one of the strongest teams in the NFC and traveling on a short week to play Matthew Stafford and a Lions team that plays well on Thanksgiving. Detroit wins this one outright.

Los Angeles Chargers (-1) at Dallas Cowboys (Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Cowboys +1 The logic: This game has gone through an absolutely terrifying amount of line movement over the past few days. After opening with the Cowboys as four-point favorites, the line has moved five points to make Dallas a slight underdog. This shift was driven by two things — a poor performance of the Cowboys on Sunday night, and an influx of money on the Chargers. Scenarios like this leave bettors with a tough choice — you can either follow the money, and lay the point with the Chargers, comfortable in the knowledge that the high-roller bettors thought it to be the right side earlier in the week, or you can take advantage of the five-point swing Vegas is now spotting you on short notice. When this game opened, I was ready to slam the Chargers — they could easily be one of the top teams in the AFC if not for their early season field-goal struggles, and the Cowboys have shown absolutely nothing on offense since the loss of Ezekiel Elliott. But with the swing, I'm going to take the five extra points, and hope for the best.

New York Giants (+7.5) at Washington Redskins (Thursday, 8:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Redskins -7.5 The logic: The Giants won in dramatic, last-second fashion last weekend. The Redskins lost in dramatic, last-second fashion last weekend. Judging by the ebb-and-flow nature of NFL football, we'll play the Redskins this week.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+9.5) at Atlanta Falcons (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Buccaneers +9.5 The logic: The Buccaneers have won two straight games, and now all of a sudden are laying almost double digits. The Falcons have looked back to their old selves the past two weeks, but it was against depleted Cowboys and Seahawks teams. This line should be closer to six, and the extra points make Tampa Bay and enticing underdog pick.

Cleveland Browns (+8.5) at Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Browns +8.5 The logic: Gah. The Browns. The scourge of my existence. Every week I believe, and every week they let me down, last week in absolutely gut-wrenching fashion. But as big underdogs against a division rival that has hardly impressed with their play this season, we're doing it again. It's Thanksgiving, and betting on the Browns is my version of Charlie Brown believing that this is the time he's finally going to kick that football.

Tennessee Titans (-3.5) at Indianapolis Colts (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Titans -3.5 The logic: Road favorites are never an easy bet for me, but the Titans are still looking to solidify their spot in the postseason, and got embarrassed last week by the Steelers. This is a good spot for them to right the tailspin against a team they've already beaten by two touchdowns earlier in the year.

Buffalo Bills (+10) at Kansas City Chiefs (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Bills +10 The logic: After Nathan Peterman imploded for the Bills, Buffalo has returned the starting quarterback role to Tyrod Taylor, who will be looking to prove they never should have benched him in the first place. He will also be playing to impress any potential offseason suitors. The Chiefs have lost four of five games and do not look like a team that should be favored by double digits against anyone.

Miami Dolphins (+16) at New England Patriots (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Dolphins +16 The logic: Along with my addiction to betting on the Browns, I also have an uncontrollable urge to bet against the Patriots. It has lost me too much money to count over the course of my life. This stems from the fact that usually their lines break every conventional rule of gambling, as they do again here. This is the highest line of the year, and in the NFL, the rule is you blindly take any three-score underdog. The Patriots feel like they are unstoppable. They've punted just three times in the past two weeks on their way to winning both games by 25 points each. But like hitting on 16, you back the Dolphins in this spot because historically it's the right play, even if it feels psychotic.

Carolina Panthers (-4.5) at New York Jets (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Panthers -4.5 The logic: Panthers are trending up and the Jets are trending down. As much as I love a home dog, this isn't a game to overthink.

Chicago Bears (+13.5) at Philadelphia Eagles (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Eagles -13.5 The logic: The nervous Philadelphia fan inside me has made me hesitant to back the Birds once we were dubbed the best team in football. But after drubbing the Cowboys last week despite losing our kicker, beating a forlorn Bears team at home by two touchdowns feels like a safe bet. More than 80% of the bets are on the Eagles, making this a sucker bet to me as a person who does his best to abide by the rules of gambling. But I'm tired of betting against my team when they're rolling. Also, if the Eagles lose, it will be entirely my fault and I will wholly accept responsibility.

Seattle Seahawks (-6.5) at San Francisco 49ers (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) The pick: Seahawks -6.5 The logic: After their crushing loss to the Falcons on Monday night, the Seahawks now find themselves in a heated battle for a postseason spot in a crowded NFC. It's a lot of points to lay on the road against a divisional opponent, but this game means so much more to the Seahawks than the Niners. Until we get confirmation that Jimmy Garoppolo is making his San Francisco debut, they're not a team to think twice about betting against.

Denver Broncos (+5) at Oakland Raiders (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) The pick: Raiders -5 The logic: It was recently announced that Paxton Lynch would be taking over starting quarterback duties for the Broncos, and I can think of better places to make your first start of the season than the hostile haunts of Raider Nation. Both teams are falling apart, but I trust the Raiders more to put the pieces back together.

New Orleans Saints (+2.5) at Los Angeles Rams (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) The pick: Rams -2.5 The logic: With the Saints coming off a dramatic comeback and the Rams coming home after their first embarrassing loss of the season, this seems like a solid play to counter public perception. That said, if you've been waiting for the Rams to fall back down to Earth, this might be the time for you to cash in on your gut feeling.

Jacksonville Jaguars (-4.5) at Arizona Cardinals (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) The pick: Cardinals +4.5 The logic: "Blaine Gabbert revenge game!" is not a sentence I thought I would be excited to write at the start of this season, but here we are.

Green Bay Packers (+14) at Pittsburgh Steelers (Sunday, 8:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Packers +14 The logic: I know Hundley was bad last weekend, but this is a few too many points, and with 75% of bets currently on the Steelers, it's a good spot to fade the public.

Houston Texans (+7) at Baltimore Ravens (Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Ravens -7 The logic: This is a coin toss for my money, and probably a stay-away game for most people. But it's a home team with a solid defense against Tom Savage and needing a win to keep pace with the AFC Wild Card race. That's good enough for me. LAST WEEK: 8-5-1

Following is a transcript of the video.

Andrew Wittman: Back in — when I was deployed, I want to say 2010, 2011, coming up to where it was my 45th birthday, I wanted to see my abs. I'm reading all the studies on how you get your body to do that. There was a lot of research on intermittent fasting, and — course, they did the studies on soldiers. Thank you, US Army.

So they found out your body really doesn't go into starvation mode. You could go 3 weeks on 800 calories and you don't lose any muscle mass as long as you're working out. Well, I could do that. So I started the fasting, the intermittent fasting, consuming my calories between 4 o'clock in the afternoon, 8 o'clock at night, by 8 o'clock at night, I'm done. I don't eat again until 4 o'clock the next day at the earliest.

And during that time I will drink lots of water. I'll drink black coffee or unsweet tea, and that's pretty much it. I started in Kosovo — we deployed, I can tell you the dates. It was my wife's birthday, February 3. I got back on May the first, I think. I followed this routine for right about 3 months, 12 weeks, 90 days, and I saw my abs... Booyah.

American fighter James Toney fought three times at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and had a run-in with Trump when the president called him "Whatshisname."

Toney also says Trump is a "racist" because of the way activist and former NFL star Colin Kaepernick has been treated.



A former world champion boxer says he regrets not punching US president Donald Trump when he had the chance.

A decorated prizefighter, American boxer James Toney has notable victories over devastating puncher Michael Nunn, heavy hitter Mike McCallum, and former Olympic gold medalist Vassiliy Jirov.

But before Toney became a remowned fighter around the world, he was once on a show promoted by Donald Trump.

Speaking to Donald McRae in The Guardian, Toney recalled an incident when he was competing on the same event as headlining boxer Roy Jones Jr.

Toney took on Doug DeWitt, but before their super middleweight fight in 1992 at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, Trump called Toney "Whatsisname." The 49-year-old regrets not punching "him in the face."

He said: "Remember when he was a promoter and he had me and Roy [Jones] on the same bill in Atlantic City. I should’ve punched him in the face but my mom… stopped me."

"Trump pointed to me and was saying: 'Call Whatsisname over here.' I’m thinking: 'Whatsisname? I’m your headline attraction and you can’t say my name?' I said to Trump: 'I’m going to bust your head open, mother f*****.'"

Toney says he was "pulled away," but regrets not "knocking his head off and saving the world lots of trouble."

He also said that the treatment of former San Francisco 49ers quaterback Colin Kaepernick shows that Trump is "a racist."

Kaepernick protested police brutality against black Americans by bending a knee rather than standing for the pre-game US national anthem.

Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract in March 2017. He is currently a free agent and has not been signed by any NFL side.

Trump has been a vocal opponent of the take-a-knee movement and posted a series of tweets in September.

In an apparent reference to Kaepernick, Trump said that if a player protests the national anthem then club owners should "Get that son of a b**** off the field."

The Atlantic said Trump's war of words focused on "black athletes" like Kaepernick. The New Yorker also wrote an article about the "racial demagoguery of Trump's assault on Kaepernick."

Toney said: "[Trump is] the president but he’s a racist. That’s why Colin Kaepernick hasn’t got a job. Pure racism from Trump down."-1

Rio Ferdinand said Neymar "put on a clinic of how to play exhilarating football" and that it was "a joy to watch."

Neymar spoke to journalists after the game and paid homage to retired boxer Floyd Mayweather by wearing the American's branded clothing.

Neymar scored twice in Paris Saint-Germain's magnificent 7-1 victory over Celtic.

The Ligue 1 leader fell behind due to an early Celtic goal but was merciless in its comeback as Neymar, Edison Cavani, Kylian Mbappé, Marco Veratti, and Dani Alves all piled the pressure onto the Scottish opponents.

Neymar scored two goals, created another, and played pitch-perfect 40-yard passes. According to BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand, Neymar was "toying" with Celtic.

He said: "Neymar put on a clinic of how to play exhilarating football. Speed. Totally toying with the opponents. And [the PSG team] is doing it all with a smile on its faces — it's a joy to watch."

Though it was a team effort and there were five different goalscorers in the dominant victory, Neymar played a part in many majestic PSG attacks. He was goalscorer, goal creator, and a creative force who played with a freedom of the pitch.

Even Ferdinand joked that PSG was "taking liberties" with people, reflecting how the club is brushing Champions League teams to the side.

PSG manager Unai Emery lauded Neymar. "He's extraordinary," Emery said, according to Goal.com. "He wants to play the games, to be present on the pitch. He makes everyone benefit from his talent."

Neymar fielded questions from journalists in the media zone after the match. Having previously been linked with a €200 million move to Real Madrid, one media member asked the Brazilian if he would consider leaving PSG.

Dressed in retired boxer Floyd Mayweather's branded clothing, Neymar slammed the reporter for being "boring" before walking away.

PSG's next game is against AS Monaco on Sunday.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/jerry-jones-backs-off-threats-to-sue-fellow-nfl-owners-2017-11Jerry Jones backs off threats to sue fellow NFL ownersJerry Jones has walked back his initial threats to sue the NFL and his fellow owners in a letter sent to Falcons owner Arthur Blank.

Jones argued that he just wanted to ensure that owners who were not a part of the NFL's compensation committee had an opportunity to be heard before Roger Goodell's extension as commissioner went forward.

Jones also denied again that his attacks on Goodell were in any way related to the suspension of Ezekiel Elliott.



Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has walked back his threats to sue his fellow NFL owners.

As Ken Belson of the New York Times reports, Jones took a different tone in a letter sent to Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons and chairman of the NFL's compensation committee who has been described as the "point man" on negotiating Goodell's extension.

In the letter, Jones said that his threats of legal action were an effort to ensure that all owners had "a voice in approving the terms" of Goodell's contract extension, rather than those with a vote on the compensation committee. "With the committee now receiving valuable feedback from a number of owners," Jones said, he is "standing down from my threat of litigation against the committee," according to the Times.

Jones has been a vocal advocate against extending Goodell's contract as commissioner, and had initially threatened a lawsuit against both the league and individual owners in an effort to delay the process. But after a back and forth with the league that included threats of a "nuclear option" that might force Jones to sell the Cowboys, Jones is now backing off his initial bluster.

Jones also repeated in the letter that his fight against Goodell had nothing to do with suspension of star Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott.

With the letter, Jones presents football fans first signal that the circus surrounding Goodell's extension might be finally coming to a sane conclusion.-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/lavar-ball-lakers-coaching-lonzo-ball-criticism-2017-115 months after LaVar Ball said he would be hands-off with the Lakers, he is questioning their handling of Lonzo BallLonzo Ball has been struggling with his shot in the NBA and has sat on the bench late in some games.

LaVar Ball, who had previously said he would not intervene with the Los Angeles Lakers' coaching of Lonzo, said the team is "babying" Lonzo and not coaching him properly.

While LaVar did not specifically criticize Luke Walton, it can't be a welcomed development for Lakers coaches.



Amid the ongoing feud between LaVar Ball and President Donald Trump, a concern has risen for the Los Angeles Lakers: when LaVar isn't going back at Trump, he's criticizing the Lakers' coaching.

When the Lakers took LaVar's son Lonzo Ball with the second pick in the draft, it came after LaVar told Lakers president Magic Johnson that he would be hands-off with the team and his son.

"He said, 'Earvin, look, I'm not following my son. I'm not going to be hanging out in L.A. I'm going to be training these young kids [his other sons],'" Johnson told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.

LaVar said he told Johnson, "'As far as training my boy, this is as far as I can take him. I'll leave it up to you to take him further.'"

However, as Lonzo has struggled mightily with his shot and consistency in the NBA, at times sitting out late in games, LaVar has grown impatient with Lakers coach Luke Walton. LaVar told Bleacher Report's Eric Pincus that the Lakers are "soft" on Lonzo.

"He's been away from me too long. I see tendencies in his game — they're trying to baby him a little bit ... They're soft. They don't know how to coach my son. I know how to coach him. I tell him to go get the victory. Stop messing around."

Asked if he had a problem with Walton, LaVar told Pincus, "No, I have a problem with losing."

The Lakers are 8-10 and Lonzo has shot just 30.8% from the field, 23% from three while averaging 8.9 points per game. While he leads the team in assists and has contributed in rebounding, Ball's shooting woes have been cause for concern in LA. Compared to LaVar, however, Walton has taken the calm route, saying every game is a learning experience.

LaVar criticized that mentality:

"What I mean by babying [Lonzo], 'He'll figure it out.' It ain't about that. 'Be patient with him?' Ain't no patience if you're winning."

"They're letting it go too easy, saying they're a young team. Forget about that! Put the [onus] on them. Say, 'You guys need to win. You've got enough talent. Win some games.'"

The Lakers can't be thrilled with this development, and it can't make things any easier on Lonzo, who now has two prominent voices in his ears telling him different things.

Intervening sports parents are nothing new, but few command the media attention and hype as LaVar — who, again, is in a spat with the president. LaVar's boisterous and overbearing style has already drawn other players to go after Lonzo and play harder than usual.

Walton is preaching patience, but it may be worth watching how he handles critiques from the outside, especially from someone who said they would lay off.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/joel-embiid-is-showing-he-can-beat-opponents-physically-and-mentally-2017-11Joel Embiid shows he can beat opponents physically and mentally with a masterful sequenceJoel Embiid trolled Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell into a cheap technical foul on Monday night.

After the game, Embiid openly admitted to flopping on the play, causing reporters to laugh at his bluntness on the matter.

The move shows Embiid's potential to become one of the legendary trash talkers in the league.



Despite being just 45 games into his NBA career, Joel Embiid is already showing a range to his game that makes some believe he could go down as one of the greatest players ever.

During the Sixers' road trip, Embiid played some of the best games yet in his career, including a 46-point performance against the Lakers that served as a coming out party to any basketball fans who weren't yet aware of Embiid's dominant abilities.

But on Monday night against the Utah Jazz, Embiid showed a different type of dominance — that of the mental mind games that can take over NBA courts.

In the third quarter, Embiid delivered a hard block to Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell. After the play, he stared down Mitchell as he was on the ground, said some words, and began to trot back to the Sixers side of the floor. In response, Mitchell got up and shoved Embiid. When Embiid embellished the contact and fell to the ground, Mitchell was immediately hit with a technical foul, which Embiid mimed along with and used to pump up the home crowd.

You can watch the whole scene play out below.

The STUFF.

The STARE.

The SHOVE.

While the play obviously started with Embiid's physical dominance, after the block, it's the center's tendency to troll that takes over on the court, and he employs in to perfection. As soon as Mitchell makes contact with him he falls to the floor — all seven feet and 250 pounds of him — in a heap in order to draw the foul, which he then celebrates with an smile that reads simply, "Gotcha."

Despite a relatively mediocre statline from Embiid — 15 points, 11 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 blocks in 27 minutes of work — his provocation of Mitchell still provided him with the highlight of the night as the Sixers took the win 107-86.

After the game, Embiid openly acknowledged the fact that he flopped while speaking with reporters. "Obviously I blocked the shot, and said then I something to him," Embiid said when asked to talk through the play. "And then he just got up and kind of fake shoved me, and I flopped, and he got a technical for it. So that's basically how it happened."

Reporters broke out in laughter after he admitted to "flopping" so openly.

Embiid added that it was all a light-hearted affair though, saying "But it's all fun after the game. We shook hands. It was all fun."

You can watch Embiid's post-game interview below.

The NBA is known for its legendary trash talkers, from Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett to current title-holder Draymond Green. But not even 50 games into his young career, Embiid is already showing an acumen for the art form, and getting results.

Combined with his fantastic play on the court and his fun-loving social media presence that has made him so beloved throughout the league, Embiid is developing into a true triple-threat.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-ray-allen-tells-orlando-court-he-was-catfished-2017-11Former NBA star Ray Allen tells court he was a victim of 'catfishing' by man who claims he was being stalkedBryant Coleman told the Orlando court he was being stalked by Ray Allen.

Allen asked the court to throw the case out, saying he was a "catfishing" victim.

The motion claims Coleman pretended to be "a number of attractive women interested in Ray Allen."



ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Retired NBA star Ray Allen said he is a victim of "catfishing," and has asked a court to throw out a case where he is accused of stalking someone he met online.

Allen filed an emergency motion in Orange County, Florida, on Tuesday, one day after Bryant Coleman told the court he is being stalked by the 10-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion.

Allen said Coleman is the one who is stalking.

"Coleman pretended to be a number of attractive women interested in Ray Allen," read the motion filed on Allen's behalf. "Ray believed he was speaking with these women and communicated with them."

Attorney David Oscar Markus released a statement saying Allen took legal action in an effort to put an end to threats against him and his family, and that Allen was the victim "of an online scheme to extract money and embarrass him by someone who appears to be troubled."

In the filing, Allen said Coleman threatened to reveal details of their conversations, and that the sides eventually struck a deal to keep everything private. Allen said that deal has been violated and that Coleman has continued to harass him and his family through several social-media accounts.

"He posted about Ray's wife, Ray's children, Ray's dog, Ray's homes, Ray's wife's restaurant, and numerous other personal items," read the motion. "Coleman not only posted about these things, he would actually post while physically located inside Ray's wife's restaurant in Orlando. And he would make sure they knew it, tagging Ray and his wife on those posts."

Allen asked the court to stop Coleman from "cyber-stalking." It was not clear if Coleman has an attorney, and a working phone number for him could not be found.

"Ray regrets ever engaging with this person online and is thankful they never met in person," Markus said. "This experience has negatively impacted Ray, and he hopes that others might use his mistake to learn the dangers of communicating online with strangers."

Allen is the NBA's all-time leader in 3-pointers made. He won championships with Boston in 2008 and Miami in 2013, the second title coming after he made one of the most dramatic shots in playoff history — a game-tying 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in regulation of Game 6 of The Finals against San Antonio, a game that the Heat would win in overtime to extend the series to a seventh game.

Allen also played for Milwaukee and Seattle, and last appeared in the league in 2014. He and his family have lived in the Miami area since.-1

Mayfield laughed off the incident, but made the Jayhawks pay on the field, with Mayfield throwing for 257 yards, three touchdowns, and leading the Sooners to a 41-3 victory to hand Kansas their tenth loss of the season.

After a few cheap shots that didn't slow Mayfield down, the Sooners marched down the field to score once more, at which point Mayfield made the gesture towards the Kansas sidelines, grabbing his crotch and yelling curses at the opposing bench.

Mayfield is no stranger to showing emotion on the field, most notably planting the Oklahoma flag in the center of The Horseshoe after the Sooners upset victory over Ohio State earlier in the season.

Still, this gesture was one to far for the Oklahoma coaching staff. Despite Mayfield apologizing immediately after leaving the field, saying that he "got caught up" in a chippy game, head coach Lincoln Riley announced that Mayfield would not start for the Sooners on Saturday against West Virginia, and would also not be a captain for the game.

Riley was clearly emotional while speaking to the press, saying "I don’t know that I'll ever have a player who is as special to me as he is."

http://www.businessinsider.com/jurgen-klopp-once-slapped-a-player-to-goad-a-goal-out-of-him-during-an-informal-5-a-side-game-2017-11Jürgen Klopp once slapped a player to get him to score a goal during a family 5-a-side gameJürgen Klopp's extraordinary competitiveness is laid bare in a new biography by German football expert Raphael Honigstein.

In "Klopp: Bring The Noise," Honigstein says the Liverpool manager is "a sports nut" who "just wants to win."

In the book, Honigstein recalls an incident when Klopp playfully slapped a player to goad a goal out of him during a family five-a-side game on a Turkish beach.

Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp is a "sports nut" who has an extraordinary competitive streak, according to his biographer Raphael Honigstein.

That desire to win is laid bare in Honigstein's latest book, "Klopp: Bring The Noise."

Honigstein gathered stories from Klopp's family and the people he works with (and used to work with) to help craft a picture of who he is as a man and as a manager.

"They were generous with their stories," Honigstein told Business Insider. "It's hard to say I was surprised with any of it."

Asked to isolate an anecdote that helps summarise Klopp's attitude to football coaching, Honigstein pointed to a family holiday where Klopp coached a five-a-game side on a Turkish beach where "all coolness" went out the window.

Here's what the book says:

"On a family holiday in Turkey a couple of years ago, [Eintracht Amateure striker Sven] Müller was playing in a five-a-side team with Klopp's sons, Marc and Dennis. Klopp himself was injured but coached the team with real passion, giving detailed instructions from the sidelines. 'I had to go off because it was extremely hot and I'm quite old,' Müller recalls. 'I think we were narrowly in the lead. Kloppo, in his inimitable style, came up to and slapped me softly across the face. 'You will score one more goal, you'll score one more!' he told me. I went back on and did indeed score one more.'"

What's more, the team Klopp coached on that holiday ended up winning.

"He's got this doggedness when it comes to winning football games," Honigstein wrote. "Even when it's just for fun on a beach somewhere. He cannot help himself."

He added to BI: "It was just a nothing game, on the sand. I can vividly see him doing that.

"He's a sports nut. He's just wants to win everything."-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/fantasy-football-week-12-top-waiver-wire-pickups-2017-11Top 10 waiver-wire pickups for Week 12 in your fantasy football leagueWith Week 11 of the NFL season nearly in the books, it's time for another exciting waiver cycle in the world of fantasy football. As all fantasy owners know, a Thursday night game can be a big reason to stay away from an otherwise trendy player. Because of the Thanksgiving holiday, there are three such matchups this week, which could lead to several brutal game-time decisions. While the players included below are a diverse group, you'll notice that only one of them is from a team with a Thanksgiving game. Get set for Week 12 by reading up on these 10 potential pickups. View As: One Page Slides

Samaje Perine, RB Team: Washington Redskins Week 11 stats: 117 rushing yards, 9 receiving yards, one reception, one touchdown One thing to know: Perine became trendy when the Redskins moved the starter Rob Kelley to the injured reserve last week, and his stock just about exploded when Chris Thompson went down with a fractured fibula during Sunday's game. Even if he's too tired to do much of anything against the New York Giants on Thursday, he's a great pickup for the rest of the way.

Corey Coleman, WR Team: Cleveland Browns Week 11 stats: 80 receiving yards, six receptions One thing to know: After missing most of the season because of a hand injury, Coleman picked up right where he left off: as the Browns' No. 1 receiver. With a catch rate of 54.5%, he was hampered by DeShone Kizer's inaccuracy, but he's still an interesting waiver candidate because of volume alone. The Jacksonville Jaguars defense was on its game on Sunday, but Cleveland's opponents for this week, the Cincinnati Bengals, won't pose nearly as much of a challenge.

Devontae Booker, RB Team: Denver Broncos Week 11 stats: 44 rushing yards, 54 receiving yards, five receptions One thing to know: Despite getting a comparable number of touches, this Utah product vastly outproduced the former Pro Bowler C.J. Anderson on Sunday. At 3-7, the Broncos should be much more interested in next season than this one, so expect the 25-year-old Booker to see plenty of action going forward.

Kenny Stills, WR Team: Miami Dolphins Week 11 stats: 180 receiving yards, seven receptions, one touchdown One thing to know: Stills was having a quiet November before Sunday's game, when he rode his chemistry with the backup quarterback Matt Moore to one of the best receiving lines of Week 11. With the New England Patriots on deck twice in the next three weeks, Stills looks like a good bet to stay productive in the games ahead.

Damien Williams, RB Team: Miami Dolphins Week 11 stats: 78 rushing yards, 24 receiving yards, one reception One thing to know: Kenyan Drake was the more popular play out of the Dolphins' backfield by committee, but it looks as if Williams could end up being their primary weapon on the ground. With Jay Cutler in concussion protocol, Miami may need to rely on its running backs more than usual in Week 12.

Tyrod Taylor, QB Team: Buffalo Bills Week 11 stats: 158 passing yards, 38 rushing yards, two touchdowns One thing to know: NFL fans were shocked when the Bills announced last week that they were benching Taylor in favor of the rookie Nathan Peterman, and sure enough, Taylor was back in the game for the second half. He made the most of his limited opportunities, compiling just over 18 fantasy points. While Sean McDermott says he's "still evaluating" the situation, the Bills would be crazy to try Peterman again.

Charles Clay, TE Team: Buffalo Bills Week 11 stats: 27 receiving yards, three receptions One thing to know: Clay hasn't been very impressive since returning from his injury, but the tight end waiver wire is fairly thin these days. At least he has an undeniable chemistry with Tyrod Taylor, who should get a chance to play in all four quarters in Week 12. If nothing else, bank on the Bills' highly favorable schedule over the next three weeks, when they'll face the Kansas City Chiefs, Patriots, and Indianapolis Colts.

Mike Wallace, WR Team: Baltimore Ravens Week 11 stats: 56 receiving yards, four receptions, one touchdown One thing to know: Wallace is on pace for some of the worst numbers of his nine-year career, but don't blame that on his recent performance. The Ole Miss product has caught two touchdown passes in his past two games, including a one-handed, 21-yard grab against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. With Joe Flacco playing a bit better of late, it's a great time to snag this veteran.

Stephen Hauschka, K Team: Buffalo Bills Week 11 stats: 1/1 field goals, 3/3 extra points One thing to know: This Massachusetts native has missed just one field goal since Week 2, so with him, the concern is more about volume than skill. Fortunately, the Bills are set to play three of the NFL's six-worst defenses on a per-play basis over the next three weeks. Invest in Hauschka with confidence.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/amanda-staveley-pcp-300-million-offer-newcastle-united-report-2017-11Middle Eastern financier Amanda Staveley reportedly made a £300m bid for Newcastle UnitedA British multi-millionaire financier has reportedly made a £300 million ($397 million) bid for Premier League team Newcastle United.

PCP Capital Partners, a wealth management firm run by powerful Middle Eastern financier Amanda Staveley, has made a formal bid to buy the football team, according to a new report from Sky News.

There have been rumours and speculation about a possible bid from Staveley since October, when she attended a match between Newcastle and Liverpool (it ended in a draw, 1-1), and then allegedly spoke to officials for the team after the match.

The £300 million is reportedly a mix of Staveley's own funds and other investors, and it's not clear if there are other "credible" bidders, Sky News reported.

Newcastle United is currently owned by Mike Ashley, billionaire founder of Sports Direct. He bought the club for around £135 million ($179 million) and also gave it interest-free loans, making his total investment around £260 million ($344 million), according to Chronicle Live.

Staveley has a net worth of £110 million ($146 million), according to the Sunday Times richlist, while her firm PCP's clientele includes Middle Eastern royalty and businessmen. She's also the ex-girlfriend of Prince Andrew, and a former model.

She has previously bid — twice — for Liverpool, and helped Sheikh Mansour with his 2008 takeover of Manchester City.0

Senior EU figures view Britain's leading politicians as "unimpressive" and low quality.

Irish government paper notes that Brexit Secretary David Davis had a meeting with the French European affairs minister without mentioning Brexit once.

Prime minister's spokesperson says the government is working hard on Brexit.



LONDON — A leaked document has revealed the scathing view of senior EU figures about leading politicians in Theresa May's government

The internal paper by the Irish government's Department of Foreign Affairs documents scathing assessments of British ministers and EU figures bemoaning "political confusion" in the government contributing to the slow progress of Brexit talks.

One senior official said they were alarmed by "chaos in the Conservative government," as ministers argue over the correct course to take as the UK leaves the EU, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported.

According to the leaked paper, officials were amazed that Brexit Secretary David Davis had barely mentioned Brexit during a meeting with the French ministers for defence and European Affairs.

This surprised the French ministers, who thought Davis would use the meeting as an opportunity to try and smooth French resistance to negotiations advancing to the next stage.

The Czech Republic's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Jakub Dürr told Irish officials "he felt sorry for British Ambassadors around the EU trying to communicate a coherent message when there is political confusion at home."

In a separate meeting, a minister in the Czech government described Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as "unimpressive" but said that at least he had "avoided any gaffes" during a visit to the country in September.

The report is based on a series of meetings between Irish ambassadors and officials with government officials in ten EU countries and Japan.

It quotes Ian Forrester, the British judge in the European Court of Justice, bemoaning "the quality of politicians in Westminster."

According to the paper, Forrester went on to wonder whether the British public would view Brexit as "a great mistake" when they realised the reality of what leaving the EU meant for the UK.

The comments will be a worry to Theresa May, as she attempts to break the deadlock in Brexit talks before a crucial European Council summit next month.

EU heads of state will use the meeting to decide if "sufficient progress" has been made on three key issues to allow negotiations to move onto the next stage.

Last week Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that Brexit talks are not even close to progressing to the next stage.

The prime minister's spokesperson told Business Insider: "I don't comment on leaked documents but more broadly the government is working hard on preparations for Brexit. You can see that work is ongoing. There are ongoing preparations for all eventualities as spelled out by the chancellor yesterday. On Ireland, I would reiterate there is a good and constructive working relationship with the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.

"I have not seen the document and I will never comment on leaked documents."

Liberal Democrat MP and Brexit spokesperson told MPs on Thursday that the report painted a "rather unflattering picture of the UK government’s negotiating skills," and asked Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom for a debate on the government's incompetence.

In response, Leadsom told Brake to "stop talking the country down" and said: "We are extremely optimistic about the prospects for the UK as we leave the EU and his constant pessimism is not helping."-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/the-uk-is-on-course-for-longest-fall-in-living-standards-since-records-began-2017-11The UK is on course for longest fall in living standards since records beganStark new report shows the UK faces the lowest productivity growth since 1812.

Resolution Foundation Budget analysis shows Britain is on course for the longest period of falling living standards since the 1950s.

Treasury analysis finds poorest households will be hit hardest by long-term policy.



LONDON — The United Kingdom is on course for its longest period of falling living standards since records began in the 1950s, analysis published following the Budget has found.

The report published by the Resolution Foundation titled "Freshly Squeezed" says that there is a "bleak outlook" for Britain's families, as living standards fall for the longest period ever documented.

The analysis shows that average wages will not return to their 2007 peak until 2025, three years later than was forecast in the Budget in March of this year.

The think tank also found that the Office of Budget Responsibility handed Philip Hammond the biggest downgrade to productivity forecasts since its creation in 2010, as the OBR slashed its growth forecasts for the UK economy as well.

The chancellor announced that GDP growth forecasts had been revised down every year until 2021, including from 2% to 1.5% in 2017, partly due to waning productivity but also due to uncertainty over Brexit.

The report shows that productivity growth will be at just 0.1% by the end of 2017, which would make this the worst decade for productivity growth since 1812 when Britain was in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars.

Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation said: "Following years of incremental changes, yesterday the OBR handed down the mother of all economic downgrades pushing up borrowing for the Treasury.

“While Philip Hammond chose to take a relaxed approach to additional borrowing, families are unlikely to do so when it comes to the deeply troubling outlook for their living standards that the Budget numbers set out.

"Families are now projected to be in the early stages of the longest period of continuous falls in disposable incomes in over 60 years – longer even than that following the financial crisis."

Real household disposable incomes are set to fall for an unprecedented 19 successive quarters between 2015 and 2020, according to the foundation.

The report also criticised the government's announcement that stamp duty would be abolished for first time buyers on houses up to £300,000, suggesting that the £3 billion cost of the measure could have supported the building of 40,000 social rented properties or 140,000 homes through the Housing Infrastructure Fund.

The foundation's analysis shows that the policy is set to cost £160,000 for every new homeowner created, which would have been sufficient to buy people typically priced properties in over a quarter of English and Welsh local authorities.

Bell said: "On the substance of the Budget the Chancellor has made the right call in boosting housing investment and focusing on this key issue of intergenerational concern. However, yesterday’s stamp duty rabbit is in reality a very poor way to boost home ownership. Its £3bn cost could have been better spent building 140,000 new homes through the government’s own Housing Investment Fund.

“Faced with a grim economic backdrop the Chancellor will see this Budget as a political success. But that would be cold comfort for Britain’s families given the bleak outlook it paints for their living standards."

Budget will hit poorer households harder in long-term

Analysis from the Treasury shows that the budget will have a harder long-term impact on the poorest households the most, through changes to tax, welfare and public spending.

The government's own household impact assessment documents show that those in the bottom income brackets will be affected the most by policy changes, as well as those at the very top. Both groups will lose nearly 2% of their net incomes by 2019/20.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told HuffPost that Hammond was "revising people’s wages and living standards down."

He said: "The poorest tenth of households will lose about 10% of their income by 2022, while the richest will lose just 1%.

"So much for ‘tackling burning injustices’. This government is tossing fuel on the fire."-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/gibraltar-faces-the-existential-threat-of-a-hard-brexit-with-no-transition-deal-2017-11Gibraltar faces the 'existential threat' of a hard Brexit with no transition dealBritish Brexit negotiators have made no proposal on the status of Gibraltar once Britain has left the European Union, according to reports.

The British overseas territory faces the "existential threat" crashing out of the single market and being excluded from a transition deal.

LONDON — Gibraltar is reportedly facing the "existential threat" of crashing out of the single market in March 2019 and not being included in any transition deal between Britain and the European Union that follows.

A source within Spanish government has told the Guardian that the UK is yet to make a proposal to EU negotiators on what the status of the British overseas territory should be after Britain leaves the EU.

Gibraltar is on the southern coast of Spain with a population of around 30,000. It has been a British territory for over three centuries and voted overwhelmingly to stay in the European Union, with 96% of voters backing Remain.

However, to the UK's surprise, the EU's negotiating guidelines published earlier this year backed Spain in the long-standing dispute over the Rock, insisting it would be outside any future trade arrangement unless an agreement is reached between London and Madrid. This includes any transition deal, the Spanish government source claimed.

"I think the situation with Gibraltar is crystal clear,” the source cited by the Guardian said.

"Gibraltar became associated with the EU project because of their dependence in the UK. This is going to stay until March 2019. In 2019 when the UK leaves the EU, Gibraltar will leave with the UK."

"This is what we are telling the Gibraltarians. If you want to have your existing status, you will have to talk with us. And I cannot understand why Picardo has refused to do so. I think in the past he has played very hard on the other side. But reality arrives."

Gibraltar's Prime Minister, Fabian Picardo, has previously claimed that a hard Brexit — ie leaving the single market with no transitional apparatus in place — would pose an "existential threat" to the territory because of its economic dependency on Britain's membership of the EU's internal market.

Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to secure a Brexit deal that "works for Gibraltar as well as the United Kingdom" amid concerns that she'd be prepared to sacrifice Britain's control over the territory to secure favourable trade arrangements with the EU.

The overwhelming majority of Gibraltans want to remain controlled by Britain. Spain is yet to fully abandon its hope of regaining at least some control over the territory which it lost to British-Dutch forces in the early 18th century.

Speaking after the June Brexit vote, Spain's former foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said he hoped that to seeing the "Spanish flag on the rock [Gilbraltar]" was "much closer" to becoming reality.

Both the British and Gibraltar governments have consistently rejected both the possibility of Gibraltar being shared between Britain and Spain and the unlikelier prospect of it returning to total Spanish control.-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/germany-merkel-coalition-talks-political-chaos-britain-brexit-2017-11Why political chaos in Germany will not hand Britain a Brexit advantageGerman political instability will not give the UK any advantage on Brexit.

Experts tell Business Insider the political turmoil in Berlin will no "have any major impact on Brexit.

Brexit is not a "big issue" in Germany.



LONDON — Talks about forming a coalition government in Germany collapsed on Sunday, causing political instability in the most powerful country in the European Union.

The unprecedented failure of coalition talks has meant that another election could occur in January, four months after the country last went to the polls. On Monday Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would prefer to hold new elections to leading a minority government.

The development has led some prominent Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs to push UK prime minister Theresa May to "take advantage" of the situation and Merkel's weakness to suspend plans to increase the UK's offer for the divorce bill after Brexit.

Backbench Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Times it would be "foolish" to approve a higher financial settlement for the EU, and former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith urged the government to "sit tight" as the situation had tipped Brexit negotiation into chaos.

However, experts on German politics have told Business Insider that British politicians have vastly overestimated the significance of Brexit in German politics.

Dr Charlotte Galpin of the University of Birmingham said: "I wouldn't expect this to have any major impact on Brexit... Brexit has always been very low down on German politicians' list of priorities."

Dr Hartwig Pautz of the University of West Scotland told BI: "I don't think Brexit is seen to be a big issue in Germany – the decision has been taken, after all."

Galpin said: "I would see it as irrelevant. Germany does still have a government, and this idea of a crisis in Germany is being overstated in the UK press.

"I'm not sure I see any scope for change on something like the so-called divorce bill. From a German point of view, it's about the UK paying its commitments and the responsibilities it has already made to contribute to the EU budget. So there's a very different conception in Germany of what this divorce bill conflict is all about."

The former German ambassador to the UK told the Independent that instability in Berlin is "bad news for Britain," not a situation to take advantage of.

Thomas Matussek said: "I think the German instability is bad news for Britain, it’s bad news for Europe but, most of all it is bad news for the Germans ... You have a normally loud and constructive voice which has been silenced. You have a country that is looking inward and is self-absorbed.

No concessions from Germany

The UK should also not expect Germany to make concessions whether it has a stable government or not, but the current situation makes German Brexit interventions all the more unlikely.

Pautz, a co-convenor of the German Politics Specialist Group at the Political Studies Association said: "The German government is a caretaker government so they won't be willing to make significant moves on the European stage.

"Convention has it that caretaker governments should not make decisions that limit what the next legitimate government can do."

Galpin told BI: "All of the mainstream parties in Germany are more or less united on their approach to Brexit in that the guiding principle is unity amongst the EU27 and that there should be no cherry-picking of what country's like about the EU.

"With the latest developments I would expect that still remains the case, but perhaps it would be even less likely that the UK government might get concessions from Germany."

Pautz made it clear that Germans do not understand why Brexit is happening so slowly and why talks do not advance. He said: "The political class looks at Britain with some sort of bewilderment – about both the decision itself and about why progress in the negotiations doesn’t happen. People think they're playing party politics on the back of the EU.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/police-storm-manus-asylum-seekers-australia-2017-11Police storm detention center off of Australia where asylum seekers took shelter for nearly a monthPapua New Guinea authorities moved into a former Australian detention center that is now housing more than 400 asylum seekers and refugees.

The men were reportedly given an hour to leave the center, which officially closed on October 31.

Some men say they have been beaten, with their property damaged.



SYDNEY — Papua New Guinea authorities moved into the former Manus Island detention center early Thursday morning, three weeks after the center was closed by the government, in a bid to move on about 400 men who remained on-site despite the power and water being cut off.

The Iranian-Kurdish refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani was among several refugees tweeting from the center as the operation got underway.

He says police and immigration officers entered the camp shortly before 7 a.m. shouting that people had an hour to leave. Some of the detainees climbed onto the roof of one of the buildings. Others claimed the authorities were being aggressive and threatening, but the PNG police told Fairfax Media that they would not be using force to evict the refugees.

One of the men, however, said people were being beaten and forced onto buses by police and immigration.

They are beating guys, and putting them by force on buses and trucks.

They have big big rods and sticks in hands. Police and Immigration both are doing it together #ManusSOS — Walid Zazai (@ZazaiWalid) November 23, 2017

Boochani claimed an Australian Federal Police officer was guiding about 50 PNG mobile squad police officers, but the AFP subsequently said that "it has no member within the former Manus Regional Processing Centre and no involvement in Thursday's actions" and that "an AFP liaison officer is in Manus Province working in an advisory and mentoring capacity to the RPNGC on policing matters."

The police, special forces, police squad are now in their hundreds, spreading through the prison camp and around the prison. Navy soldiers are outside the prison camp. We are on high alert right now. We are under attack. — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017

We are blockading right now. So many police and immigration officers are around us at this moment. They destroyed everything and our belongings and right now are shouting at us to leave the prison camp. I am tweeting from a toilet right now. — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017

A fellow detainee, Walid Zazai, subsequently tweeted a photo he said shows Boochani being arrested and taken away.

Australia's immigration minister, Peter Dutton, told the Sydney radio station 2GB the government was "very keen" for people to leave the center.

"I think it's outrageous that people are still there and they have trashed the facility, they are living in squalor, and the Australian taxpayers have paid about $10 million for a new facility and we want people to move," he said.

The PNG government closed the center, which had reopened in 2012 under a deal with the former Australian Labor government to process asylum seekers who attempted to reach Australia by boat, on October 31 this year following a PNG Supreme Court ruling that it was illegal and in breach of the country's constitution.

The center has been without power and water since it was decommissioned, and about 380 of the 600 men there when it closed have refused to leave. This week the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said a humanitarian crisis was developing as a result and called on the Australian government to accept responsibility and act.

The UNHCR said the $10 million facility referred to by Dutton was not ready to accept the detainees.

The Australian government says the way refugees and asylum seekers are dealt with on Manus is an issue for PNG.

On Thursday morning, some refugees said that they had been beaten and that authorities were destroying their rooms and property.

The PNG police have denied destroying belongings but say they have emptied rainwater tanks on-site over concerns about disease.

New Zealand has offered to take some of the refugees from Manus, but the Australian government refused the offer, with Dutton arguing it would encourage smugglers.

Australia made a deal with the Obama administration for the US to accept genuine refugees from Manus Island and Nauru. So far, 54 have been resettled while another 500 await assessment of their status.

On Thursday, 12 former Australians of the Year published an open letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling on the government to act over the "human disaster" at the center.

"We should not withhold water from people, nor withhold food; we should not leave seriously ill people to die without medication and treatment," they wrote.

"We are also concerned about Australia's international reputation in human rights. It seems that both our major political parties have failed to meet their most basic obligations under the United Nations Refugee Convention, one that our country helped to negotiate and which we signed in 1951."

The signatories to the letter are Ita Buttrose, Rosie Batty, Simon McKeon, Patrick McGorry, Mick Dodson, Tim Flannery, Fiona Wood, Fiona Stanley, Gustav Nossal, Peter Doherty, John Yu, and Robert de Castella.

While the detainees occupying the center had been active on social media posting photos and video, several hours on, Zazai claims the group was surrounded and anyone caught filming was being beaten.

We can't take pictures or video.

Whole area surrounded by them.

When they see anyone filming they catch him, beat him and take him. #SaveUS#ManusSOS — Walid Zazai (@ZazaiWalid) November 23, 2017

Labor's shadow immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said the prime minister had a "moral obligation" to guarantee the ongoing safety and security of the detainees.

"It's time Turnbull showed some leadership and immediately secured other third-country resettlement options for eligible refugees, including accepting New Zealand's offer and negotiating appropriate conditions," he said.

Dutton, the immigration minister, said the men would not come to Australia.

Turnbull said that the refugees should obey the law and authorities and move but that the government "will not be pressured" into accepting them.

"Our border security, the integrity of our borders, is maintained by my government and we will not outsource our migration policy to people smugglers," he said.-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-meditation-mindfulness-2017-11After interviewing 140 people at the top of their fields, Tim Ferriss realized almost all of them share the same habitFor his new book "Tribe of Mentors," bestselling author and star podcast host Tim Ferriss sent 11 questions to 140 people at the top of their fields.

He found that regardless of industry, the vast majority of respondents had a mindfulness or meditation practice.

He meditates every morning for 20 minutes and has found it's improved his emotional control.



Tim Ferriss has been on an especially introspective journey over the past year.

Continuing in the vein of his other work, he decided to share with his audience what he's learned along the way.

In the last 12 months, Ferriss had the 10-year anniversary of "The 4-Hour Workweek" (the book that made him famous), had a couple close friends die, gave a viral TED Talk largely about his struggle with depression, and turned 40.

As he told us for an episode of Business Insider's podcast "Success! How I Did It," compiling material for his new book "Tribe of Mentors" was as much for him as it was for his readers. After having 140 people at the top of their fields answer the same 11 questions, Ferriss was surprised by one finding.

"Despite the fact that these are people from tennis to surfing to cryptocurrency to fill-in-the-blank, like any field you can possibly imagine — some type of morning mindfulness or meditation practice would span I'd say 90% of the respondents."

There's no denying that "mindfulness" (a type of meditation) is a buzzword and meditation a trend in business right now, but that doesn't mean that you should write them off, Ferriss explained.

"Meditation has a branding problem," he said. "A lot of people would think of yoga instructors playing didgeridoos, swinging dream-catchers over their heads — and they wouldn't be entirely wrong in a lot of cases."

But at the heart of it, meditation is a simple practice that is about training the mind's control over its emotions.

"So meditation, or mindfulness practice, it's really about, to me, decreasing emotional reactivity so you can proactively create your day and create your life; versus, just being a walking reflex that sometimes screws up," Ferriss said.

He meditates every morning for 20 minutes, followed by a two-minute decompression period, using one of the styles he's learned: Transcendental Meditation (TM), Vipassana Meditation, or a guided meditation from the app Headspace. [Headspace sponsors Ferriss' podcast, but we can vouch for its effectiveness.]

The forms of meditation that have lately caught on in Wall Street and Silicon Valley are typically lightly secularized versions of ancient Hindu or Buddhist practices designed to create an inner peace through connection with God and creation.

The pure forms of these practices may scare away non-believers or practitioners of other faiths, but a major draw to the secular versions has been a large accumulation of scientific evidence that meditation has a tangible positive effect on the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for emotions, fight or flight responses, and memory. The National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association have both concluded that daily meditation can lower a patient's blood pressure and stress levels.

What's interesting is that there's very little difference between religious and secular meditation. For example, Headspace has guided visualization exercises in which the listener imagines a beam of light flowing through them and out to loved ones and strangers — that's identical to a Buddhist compassion exercise. In TM, meditators repeat a meaningless mantra in their mind with the aim of feeling a transcendence over their thoughts — a practicing Hindu would use a meaningful mantra to achieve the same feeling. The differences are simply presentation and the lens through which someone chooses to view their experience.

Regardless of how one chooses to meditate, there is proof that it's like a workout for building the skill of emotional control, and that in turn is a valuable skill to have when you're a high performer in any field.

As soon as he realized this, Ferriss said, "it reinforced the need for me ... to do the same."0
http://www.businessinsider.com/how-successful-people-spend-holiday-weekends-2016-911 things unsuccessful people do over long weekends• Thanksgiving is this week — which means some workers in the US will be getting some time off Thursday and Friday. • Business Insider reached out to three experts to get a sense of some pitfalls to avoid during long weekends. • They recommended protecting and being intentional with your time off.

Many people across the US will have Thursday — and, potentially, Friday — off, thanks to Thanksgiving. We already know what successful people will be doing over the long weekend. But what about the unsuccessful people among us? What mistakes can we watch out for and avoid? After all, you don't want your free time go down the drain. With that in mind, let's discuss some behaviors to avoid. Here are 11 things unsuccessful people do over long weekends: View As: One Page Slides

1. They neglect their loved ones "A three-day weekend lets you schedule this critical quality time," says Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and the author of "Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job." That being said, spending a long weekend getting away from everyone isn't necessarily a bad thing. But unsuccessful individuals don't avoid people because they're mindfully trying to unwind — they do it because something's holding them back from connecting.

2. They stress out We all need to rest and recharge our batteries from time to time. Unsuccessful people are unable to do this, even over long weekends. This leads to misery during a time that should be filled with relaxation and happiness.

3. They spend a ton of money (needlessly) You don't want to blow all your cash right before the holidays. Unsuccessful people don't know how to control themselves over long weekends and end up with empty wallets as a result. Squeezing too many impulse purchases into such a short amount of time is a really bad idea. If you're looking to have a ton of fun on a budget, consider a staycation or just carefully budgeting your fun in the sun.

4. They make unhealthy choices Unsuccessful folks tend to use any excuse to neglect their exercise routines and dig into some unhealthy stuff. A long weekend provides the perfect opportunity to shirk good habits. It's natural to want to indulge a bit, which is fine — in moderation.

5. They never stop working Unsuccessful people squander their time off by responding to work emails and catching up on busywork. If you're scheduled to work over the long weekend because you have bad luck, that's one thing. It's another thing entirely if you choose to work over the three day weekend from home. That could be a sure sign you're about to burn out or you're just addicted to work. If you really need to be productive, don't just allow work to randomly seep into your downtime. Schedule some time to deal with your work and then be done with it.

6. They constantly think about work This one isn't quite as bad as working throughout the weekend, but thinking about your job constantly isn't a great sign either. If you love your work so much that you can't get it off your mind, that's one thing. But unsuccessful people are so focused on the week ahead that they can't relax and enjoy themselves in the moment.

7. They're lazy Of course, it's important to unwind over the weekend. Unsuccessful people take this too far, though. A long weekend is the optimal time to tackle that personal, non-work-related project that you can never seem to get to during the week — cleaning the house, buying a new grill, or calling your grandmother. Make the most of your time. You'll feel better once you check something off your to-do list.

8. They don't unplug A holiday weekend is the perfect opportunity to ditch your many screens and go outside for once. Don't be one of those people that spends every waking moment attached to their social media accounts. You'll miss out on so much.

9. They don't get adventurous Long weekends are the perfect time to embark on that road trip you've always wanted to go on, or try that new restaurant, or hit the beach one last time. It's fine if you just want to relax, but if you're looking for the opportunity to do something different, you'll probably regret spending all your time on the couch. "This is a great time to unwind with your favorite pastime or hobby, whether it's shopping, golfing, socializing, reading, painting, or something else," Taylor says.

10. You don't plan anything Some people can just flow through life without ever having a plan. Good for them. If you're not like that, though, it's not a bad idea to have at least a general idea of what you want to accomplish over the long weekend — and the subsequent week. You don't have to plan out every second, of course, but you want to at least have a rough outline. Unsuccessful people end up shooting themselves in the foot by leaving everything up in the air, leading to disorganization and disappointment.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/13-things-a-movie-theater-employee-wont-tell-you-2017-1113 things a movie theater employee won’t tell youMovie theater employees in California, Illinois, and Indiana share their secrets of working in a cinemaplex.

They say the theaters aren't as clean as you would like to think, and popcorn sizes are all relative. View As: One Page Slides

There's a reason the popcorn smells so good Why does it smell so good? The popcorn has chemicals in it to make its aroma fill the theater. Try this recipe for making amazing DIY popcorn in your microwave instead.

We purposely use lower quality “Extreme Digital” is actually lower quality than IMAX digital. We use it because it’s easier to maintain. Did you know that movie theaters used to ban popcorn?! This is why.

Concessions make us money For the first month or two of screening, money from ticket sales goes to movie studios. Theaters rely on concession stands to make money. That’s why concessions are overpriced. Popcorn costs almost nothing to make. Make sure you always follow this etiquette at the movie theater.

Don't try to sneak in I know all the methods you use to sneak in. I just don't always care enough to kick you out for it.

Stick to classic movie snacks The only foods I trust are the popcorn, drinks, and boxed candy. I wouldn't eat the pretzels, hot dogs, or nachos.

Managers try to keep things calm Chances are, if you complain to the manager and he sides with you, he's just putting on a show to calm you down. The manager might pretend to yell at me for a minute, but he'll pat me on the back the moment you're out of sight.

Do the math on combination deals Combination deals don't save you money at some theaters. You'd pay the same price if you purchased the items separately.

Popcorn sizes are always changing Think you're saving calories by ordering a small popcorn? That “small” popcorn could have been a medium last month. Try out these healthier versions of your favorite junk food.

Microwave foods take a while Stop getting angry that your food isn't ready. Microwaves can't cook frozen pizzas in 30 seconds!

Don't ask for extra cups No, I can't give you extra cups. Everything is inventoried at the end of the night.

There's not a lot of time to clean Your suspicions are correct. Sometimes I sweep excess food under the seats. Movies often end every few minutes. Sometimes, three or more screenings end at the same time. I don’t always have time to clean everything up.

Yes, movies start late But they almost always end on time – otherwise, the ushers wouldn't know when to clean up. Theaters tell you to come in early so you have time to watch commercials and previews.-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-insider-secrets-2017-1111 insider facts most Black Friday workers know — and you probably don'tNo one has more insider knowledge about Black Friday than the sales associates working that day. To unearth 11 lesser-known facts about Black Friday, Business Insider surveyed more than 40 Black Friday workers. Whether you want to know what's a terrible deal or how to not get duped, read on for the inside scoop: View As: One Page Slides

The mall doesn't open until its 'anchor stores' do "Anchor stores such as Macy's, Nordstrom, and Target make the decision for the entire mall. The mall opens when they open, and those that don't comply are fined by the mall for every hour they stay closed. Some stores like Apple acknowledge this and happily pay those fines."

Black Friday sales are usually on older models and are often the same deal as last year "Most of the bigger deals are actually outdated products. Yeah, you have your new tablets and phones, but those will be very limited in both how many there are and how much you can save. Most of the biggest and most tempting savings come from products that are at least a year old or more and they have to clear out the inventory in the warehouses." According to a study from NerdWallet, 93% of stores offered customers at least one product for the exact same price in 2014 as in their 2013 Black Friday ad.

These products would probably have gone on sale anyway "New product lines come out a couple weeks after Black Friday, so those older items that are on sale on Black Friday would go on sale anyway."

You rarely ever need to be there when the store opens — the sales last all day "Most sales last all day. You don't need to be there at midnight unless you are specifically interested in the door buster items."

In fact, many begin before Black Friday "Some stores start the sales early, and there is no literal difference in price between Monday before Thanksgiving or Friday. Obviously it all depends on the store, but if you have a store you like, check ahead of time and maybe you can get those deals early, maybe even before your size is gone in the Black Friday frenzy."

Stores will use all sorts of tricks to get you to spend more "At higher-end stores, don't fall for the freebie Prosecco or Pellegrino. Stores just want to keep you in there longer so you'll spend money." This isn't the only trick stores use to get you to spend more during the holiday season. "The stores are really desperate for your business and will stop at nothing to upsell you. "Where I worked, HQ would set next-to-impossibly high sales goals that each store was responsible for hitting. We were instructed that once we had someone on the line with money to spend, to 'keep her naked' in the dressing room and constantly bring her different colors, accessories, shoes, jewelry, Pellegrino, the works. The idea was that the more she tried on, the more you told her it to look great, the more she'd spend."

They'll even sometimes increase the 'normal' price of an item before the holidays to make the discount seem deeper "The stuff is marked up from the original cost and then marked down to make people think they are getting a deal." According to The Wall Street Journal, retailers will slightly increase the "normal" price of an item in the days before their Black Friday sales so that the discounts appear deeper. In fact, WSJ reported an 8% increase in a fifth of the sale items it tracked before Black Friday and a 23% uptick in the pre-sale prices of toys and tools.

Some items are made specifically for Black Friday and are lower quality "The TVs and computers are made just for that day and are lower quality than usual." CNN and Forbes report that major retailers will often sell special electronics that are manufactured by big-name brands just for Black Friday and are of lower quality.

If you're not nice, you may pay the price "Black Friday shoppers tend to bang on doors, assuming that if they cause enough chaos, they will be allowed in. "Banging on the door will make all of us hate you. As in, if there is a chance to make your shopping experience a little more difficult via small, passive-aggressive actions, we will do it. Think $50 and $100 bill checks, 'a slow register', and 'Aw, we just ran out of gift wrapping.' "All I can offer is, be nice. No one chooses to work the day after Thanksgiving."

When associates say they're out of something, they usually mean it "When we tell you we don't have anything left, please don't demand someone else to check. There isn't a fairy godmother in the back making stuff. If we tell you, "we don't have anymore," please understand the words coming out of our mouths."1
http://www.businessinsider.com/what-successful-people-have-in-common-according-to-wikipedia-2017-11An ex-Google data scientist studied thousands of successful people on Wikipedia — here's what they have in commonUnless you're famous for doing something terrible, having your own Wikipedia page is probably a point of pride. The question on Seth Stephens-Davidowitz's mind is: What does it take to actually attain that level of prominence? Stephens-Davidowitz is a former Google data scientist and Harvard-trained economist. He's also the author of the book "Everybody Lies," which presents research on how internet searches can get at people's innermost thoughts. Instead of calling people into a lab, Stephens-Davidowitz prefers to look at what the masses are confessing to Google at 8:36 p.m. on a Wednesday. This data can also be harnessed to learn a few things about what makes people successful. To do that, Stephens-Davidowitz downloaded all of Wikipedia — "You can do that sort of thing nowadays," he wrote — and plucked more than 150,000 editor-approved entries about individuals to comprise his initial dataset. His metric for success was simply that the included individuals had their own Wikipedia page. Here's what he found. View As: One Page Slides

They grow up near big college towns. Geography played an enormous role in producing a Wikipedia success story, according to Stephens-Davidowitz's research, in particular when there was a thriving college town nearby. For example, the counties containing Madison, Wisconsin; Berkeley, California; Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and Ithaca, New York were all in the top 3% of page frequency. Those towns are home to the University of Madison, Wisconsin; University of California, Berkeley; UNC Chapel Hill; and Cornell. When Stephens-Davidowitz sliced the data even further, he found college towns were especially good at producing famous musicians. "A kid in a college town will be exposed to unique concerts, unusual radio stations, and even independent record stores," he wrote.

They grow up in counties with big cities. If a county didn't have a college town, people were still more likely to find success if there was a big city nearby. It's more important to be near big ideas than big backyards, Stephens-Davidowitz wrote. "Being born in San Francisco County, Los Angeles County, or New York City all offered among the highest probabilities of making it to Wikipedia," he wrote, reasoning that "urban areas tend to be well supplied with models of success." New York City was most likely to produce notable journalists, Boston produced the most scientists, and Los Angeles produced the most actors — all relying solely on who was born there, not who moved there. "And this holds true even after subtracting people with notable parents in that field," Stephens-Davidowitz wrote.

Their hometowns are culturally diverse. Tracking with the finding that famous people grew up near novel ideas, Stephens-Davidowitz found counties with higher proportions of immigrants produced more notable people than homogeneous ones. His data showed it's even better if the parents themselves are immigrants: At least 13 of the 100 most famous white baby boomers were children of immigrants, according to MIT's Pantheon Project, which also used Wikipedia data. That's more than three times higher than the national average during the period, Stephens-Davidowitz noted. "If two places have similar urban and college populations," he wrote, "the one with more immigrants wil produce more prominent Americans."

Sometimes, they specialize. When it doubt, Stephens-Davidowitz wrote, go narrow. Roseau County, Minnesota doesn't have the urban population, diversity, or big college presence that many other notable counties do. But it does make Stephens-Davidowitz's list for a simple reason: It produces star hockey players. Roughly one in 740 people from Roseau County made it into Wikipedia — nine in total, all of them professional hockey players, "no doubt helped by the county's world-class youth and high school hockey programs."0
http://www.businessinsider.com/rent-the-runway-unlimited-subscription-review-2017-7I've used Rent the Runway's unlimited subscription for a year — and it's completely changed the way I shopRent the Runway's unlimited subscription allows you to have four items at home at a time, with unlimited exchanges.

For a monthly fee of $159 plus tax — which includes shipping, dry cleaning, and insurance — I rent about 18 pieces a month.

The service has saved me time and money, while reducing closet clutter and increasing wardrobe variation.

Shopping isn't high on my list of favorite activities.

I'd rather spend my excess time and money on travel. But since I can't get away with wearing jeans and a T-shirt to the office every day, finding a workwear solution that fits my lifestyle and budget is a necessity.

On a whim last year, thanks to my stylish friend Yelena's recommendation and a Cyber Monday discount, I signed up for Rent the Runway's unlimited subscription, RTR Unlimited. I assumed it would be fun to try, but not something I would stick with after the initial month.

As I do with any subscription trial period I sign up for, I set a calendar alert to remind myself to cancel it before the full-price charge hit my credit card the next month. But, after the first month ended, I decided to try it for another month. And then another.

Now, one year later, not only am I still using the service, it's completely changed the way I think about shopping.

Here's how RTR Unlimited works

For a monthly fee of $159 plus sales tax, Rent the Runway allows you to rent four pieces of clothing or accessories at a time and make exchanges as often as you like. You can pause or cancel your account at any time.

The fee includes shipping both ways, dry cleaning, and insurance. I happened to be at a restaurant, wearing a dress that retails for $1,500, when a diner at a neighboring table spilled an entire glass of white wine on me. So, insurance is important. But keep in mind that significant damage, loss, and theft are not covered.

According to the website, it can take up to five days for items to arrive, but in my experience shipments almost always go out within a day or two. Any time there's been an issue with one of my orders — such as something arriving with a broken zipper or not shipping quickly — customer service agents have been responsive and helpful, immediately offering a replacement.

RTR Unlimited costs me a little over $1,800 annually — about the same as the average American household spends on clothing in a year. I wear approximately 18 pieces a month, meaning each item costs me under $10. Given that the going price for dry cleaning one dress is $12 in my neighborhood — something I don't have to worry about with Rent the Runway — the cost is more than worth it for me.

Plus, my spending on other clothing has dwindled, partly because I don't need anything else, and partly because it's more fun to direct my online-shopping energy toward browsing the designer pieces I can access through Rent the Runway.

Renting clothes is becoming standard

I'm not the only one embracing the 'clothing-sharing economy' — it's an industry that's growing. As Business Insider's Dennis Green reported, Rent the Runway reached its goal of $100 million in annual sales last November, and as of January, The Black Tux, a modern solution to formal wear rentals for guys, saw monthly sales hit $2 million with a two-fold increase year-over-year. Gwynnie Bee, a plus-size clothing rental service, is also gaining traction.

"I wouldn't go so far as to say the future of fashion is rental, but I would say rental will be a major component of the future of fashion," Andrew Blackmon, a cofounder of The Black Tux, told Green.

That could be a good thing — for our wallets, our closets, and our peace of mind.

Most of us are looking at clothes all wrong

The average person has 57 items of unworn clothing and spends 15 minutes deciding what to wear every morning, according to a recent survey by non-profit Oxfam and British retailer Marks and Spencer. On average, we regularly wear just 44% of the clothing we own, and nearly half of people admit they need to clean out their closet.

Part of the problem may be that sizes fluctuate, styles change, and sales are hard to pass up — but closet clutter isn't free. Renting a portion of your wardrobe, and using the rest of your clothing budget to invest in high-quality pieces that last, instead of wasting money on poorly made clothes from fast-fashion brands, could save you money in the long run.

For example, the cost-per-wear of a $150 pair of pants that can be worn 50 times ($3/wear) is better than that of a $50 pair of pants that falls apart after 10 wears ($5/wear). The more expensive pair is likely to fit better and look better, too.

Added bonus: When an event calls for attire outside of your standard wardrobe, an unlimited clothing subscription like Rent the Runway allows you to choose exactly the right outfit for the occasion, instead of buying something you'd wear only once.

Occasionally, I rent something that I love enough to purchase. For those items, Rent the Runway is the perfect 'try before you buy' solution. Once you know your size, you can wait for it to go on sale — even final sale — without taking the risk that it won't fit. I've managed to buy beautiful designer dresses for the same price I'd pay for a dress at J. Crew. Many previously worn items can also be bought at a discount through Rent the Runway.

If you really like a certain piece, but not enough to own it forever, you don't have to. As long as your account is in good standing, there's no limit to how long you can hang onto an item. I've done this twice so far — both times when a jacket I requested arrived new with tags. By holding onto one piece, it reduced the number of items I was able to cycle through, but not by much — I still managed to rent 12 items during those months.

It's not just about the money

There are non-financial benefits to using Rent the Runway's unlimited subscription as well. I spend way less time doing laundry and picking out what to wear. Now, I just scroll through the app, add whatever catches my eye to the cart, and wear it once it arrives. When I'm done, I send it back and start the process again.

Not to mention, having access to a wide variety of items is simply more fun than owning a wardrobe full of clothes that I wear over and over again.

The longer I use Rent the Runway, the more I'm convinced of its value. I happily participate in other parts of the sharing economy — with services like Amazon Music Unlimited, Netflix, and ride-sharing service Via — so why wouldn't I apply the same principles to my closet as well?

I for one, am sold.0
https://www.businessinsider.com.au/products-australians-want-amazon-2017-11Here's what Australian shoppers want to buy from AmazoniStock

Australian consumers are most likely to target electrical goods, apparel and shoes, and cosmetics from Amazon Australia.

It’s one of the observations drawn by UBS as part of the bank’s research into the impact of Amazon’s arrival.

Their findings are summarised in the chart below:

Here’s what the bank had to say about the top three categories, including the relative impact on competitors:

1. Electrical/ Appliances: Particularly high-margin accessories which, in our view, make up a large portion of electronic retailers’ gross profits. 2. Apparel/ Shoes: While customer returns are an impediment to the category, Amazon has been allocating more capital towards apparel since 2012. Specialty fashion retailers, as well as department stores are most exposed. 3. Cosmetics/ Skin: A low value / high-margin category which is particularly valuable for Australian Department stores (~20% sales exposure).

The UBS analysts said the sectors which will be least exposed to Amazon’s arrival are baby products (excluding toys) such as prams, auto parts, and fresh groceries.

This chart shows UBS’ estimates for how much market share by sector Amazon Australia will achieve by June 2023:

http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-mueller-michael-flynn-russia-investigation-lobbying-turkey-2017-11Mueller is zeroing in on Michael FlynnRobert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation, is looking into Bijan Kian, a former business associate of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Mueller is primarily interested in gauging what role Kian played in Flynn Intel Group's lobbying activity for a Turkish businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Flynn has come under scrutiny because of his contacts with Russian officials and his work as a foreign agent, and recent revelations could mean Mueller sees Flynn as his next target.



Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation, is looking into an associate of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, NBC News reported Wednesday, in a likely sign that the inquiry is steering toward Flynn's activities.

Mueller is tasked with looking into Russia's interference in the 2016 election as well as whether any members of President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor.

When it comes to Flynn, Mueller is focused mainly on his work as a foreign agent and his lobbying activities, throughout the latter half of 2016, for a businessman with ties to the Turkish government.

Flynn was paid $530,000 last year by the businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who is a member of a Turkish economic-relations board run by an appointee of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Alptekin is also the head of Inovo, a consulting firm.

Flynn's firm was tasked with fomenting dissent inside Turkey and with lobbying the US government to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup.

Flynn Intel Group was required, under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, to register as a foreign agent as soon as it secured the contract with Inovo, but it did not do so until months later. It acknowledged in a filing that its work could have "principally benefited" Turkey.

The latest focus for Mueller, NBC News reported Wednesday, is Bijan Kian, a former business partner of Flynn's. Mueller is reportedly seeking to gauge what role, if any, Kian played in securing the Inovo contract for Flynn Intel Group. The special counsel's office also wants to know whether Kian has any information about other lobbying efforts the firm may have undertaken that have not yet been disclosed, NBC News said.

Sources told NBC News that prosecutors were also interested in a September 20, 2016, meeting between Kian, Flynn, and the pro-Russia congressman Dana Rohrabacher.

Mueller turns up the heat on Flynn

The Russia investigation has ramped up in recent weeks, particularly after a federal grand jury indicted Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and one of his associates, Rick Gates, in October on 12 counts related to money laundering, financial crimes, and their work as foreign agents.

Since then, multiple media reports have suggested that Mueller is zeroing in on Flynn, who legal experts have said could be increasingly vulnerable in the Russia investigation.

Mueller's team subpoenaed the lobbying firm SGR LLC in August after Flynn Intel Group hired the firm ostensibly to "promote a good business climate in Turkey," The Washington Post reported. Flynn's firm hired SGR as part of its work with Inovo.

Though Flynn Intel Group's initial stated goal in hiring SGR was to foster a stronger business climate in Turkey, it was later forced to indicate that it brought SGR on to "raise concerns" to the US about Gulen.

At the beginning of November, NBC News reported that Mueller had enough evidence to indict Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr.

A former business associate of Flynn's said the younger Flynn had a prominent role in Flynn Intel Group's day-to-day operations and served as his father's chief of staff, and Mueller could be turning up the heat on the younger Flynn to prompt his father's cooperation in the investigation. CNN also reported that Flynn and his wife, Lori, were worried their son could get caught in the crosshairs of the investigation.

It's unclear who the source of the NBC News report about a possible Flynn indictment was, but legal experts floated the possibility that the leak came from Flynn's defense team, which could have been using it in an effort to secure a pardon from Trump.

Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white-collar defense attorney at Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C., said earlier this month that the younger Flynn's aggressive social-media campaign against Mueller and the Russia investigation suggested that he refused to flip and was hoping for a presidential pardon. Cotter also pointed to Trump's apparent loyalty to Flynn, who was one of his most prominent campaign surrogates before becoming national security adviser.

"The president of the United States, who has virtually unlimited pardon power, has gone on the record, in public, and said he doesn't think Flynn should be prosecuted," Cotter said.

"If you're Flynn's attorney, the possibility of a pardon is something you'd think about," he added. "It's an amazing thing to have the president, before your client is charged, saying publicly that he doesn't think they should even be investigated, much less charged."

Flynn was forced to resign in February when it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the US, during the transition period. Three weeks earlier, Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, warned the White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail over his conversations with Kislyak.

Trump also ignored advice during the transition period from President Barack Obama, who fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, to steer clear of Flynn.

The FBI was already investigating Flynn when he resigned. He informed the Trump transition team in January, before the inauguration, that he was the subject of a separate FBI investigation related to his lobbying work for Turkey. He joined the administration as national security adviser shortly after.

Flynn's activities came up in a February conversation between Trump and the FBI director at the time, James Comey. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June that soon after Flynn resigned, Trump approached him and asked him to "let this go," referring to the bureau's investigation into the former national security adviser. Comey said he refused to assure Trump that the FBI would do so.

Trump fired Comey in May, later citing "this Russia thing" as a factor in his decision.0
https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-uk-is-on-course-for-longest-fall-in-living-standards-since-records-began-2017-11The UK is on course for longest fall in living standards since records beganJack Taylor/Getty Images Philip Hammond (C) leaves Downing Street with his Treasury team

Stark new report shows the UK faces the lowest productivity growth since 1812.

Resolution Foundation Budget analysis shows Britain is on course for the longest period of falling living standards since the 1950s.

Treasury analysis finds poorest households will be hit hardest by long-term policy.

LONDON – The United Kingdom is on course for its longest period of falling living standards since records began in the 1950s, analysis published following the Budget has found.

The report published by the Resolution Foundation titled “Freshly Squeezed” says that there is a “bleak outlook” for Britain’s families, as living standards fall for the longest period ever documented.

The analysis shows that average wages will not return to their 2007 peak until 2025, three years later than was forecast in the Budget in March of this year.

The think tank also found that the Office of Budget Responsibility handed Philip Hammond the biggest downgrade to productivity forecasts since its creation in 2010, as the OBR slashed its growth forecasts for the UK economy as well.

The chancellor announced that GDP growth forecasts had been revised down every year until 2021, including from 2% to 1.5% in 2017, partly due to waning productivity but also due to uncertainty over Brexit.

The report shows that productivity growth will be at just 0.1% by the end of 2017, which would make this the worst decade for productivity growth since 1812 when Britain was in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars.

Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation said: “Following years of incremental changes, yesterday the OBR handed down the mother of all economic downgrades pushing up borrowing for the Treasury.

“While Philip Hammond chose to take a relaxed approach to additional borrowing, families are unlikely to do so when it comes to the deeply troubling outlook for their living standards that the Budget numbers set out.

“Families are now projected to be in the early stages of the longest period of continuous falls in disposable incomes in over 60 years – longer even than that following the financial crisis.”

Real household disposable incomes are set to fall for an unprecedented 19 successive quarters between 2015 and 2020, according to the foundation.

The report also criticised the government’s announcement that stamp duty would be abolished for first time buyers on houses up to £300,000, suggesting that the £3 billion cost of the measure could have supported the building of 40,000 social rented properties or 140,000 homes through the Housing Infrastructure Fund.

The foundation’s analysis shows that the policy is set to cost £160,000 for every new homeowner created, which would have been sufficient to buy people typically priced properties in over a quarter of English and Welsh local authorities.

Bell said: “On the substance of the Budget the Chancellor has made the right call in boosting housing investment and focusing on this key issue of intergenerational concern. However, yesterday’s stamp duty rabbit is in reality a very poor way to boost home ownership. Its £3bn cost could have been better spent building 140,000 new homes through the government’s own Housing Investment Fund.

“Faced with a grim economic backdrop the Chancellor will see this Budget as a political success. But that would be cold comfort for Britain’s families given the bleak outlook it paints for their living standards.”

Budget will hit poorer households harder in long-term

Analysis from the Treasury shows that the budget will have a harder long-term impact on the poorest households the most, through changes to tax, welfare and public spending.

The government’s own household impact assessment documents show that those in the bottom income brackets will be affected the most by policy changes, as well as those at the very top. Both groups will lose nearly 2% of their net incomes by 2019/20.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told HuffPost that Hammond was “revising people’s wages and living standards down.”

He said: “The poorest tenth of households will lose about 10% of their income by 2022, while the richest will lose just 1%.

“So much for ‘tackling burning injustices’. This government is tossing fuel on the fire.”

Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost economic activity annually, according to an analysis of government figures.

Leaving the EU is already dragging down the British economy.

The UK is now growing more slowly than Japan or Italy.



LONDON - Chancellor Philip Hammond's annual budget, presented yesterday, has finally given Britain the first concrete numbers on the cost of Brexit.

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility published revised GDP growth numbers based on data following the June 2016 referendum. Those new estimates suggest that Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost annual economic activity by 2021, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation.

Previously, the best estimate of the economic damage leaving Europe will inflict on the UK came from a private estimate by one of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis's advisors, of about £22 billion per year, mostly from extra trade tariffs and barriers.

Here are the new GDP charts from the OBR.

They show other major economies such as the US, the EU, and Canada all growing faster now than they were in the six months prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016. Only in the UK has growth slowed, as the pound lost value and investors hit the pause button. Even Japan, an infamous economic basket case hobbled by years of stagnation, is doing better than the UK:

OBR

In terms of sequential GDP growth through Q3 2017, Britain now lags France and debt-ridden Italy, too. This chart of OECD data comes from Michael Baxter of Share Centre:

The Share Centre

This next chart shows how much we are forecast to lose in GDP activity every year, based on the difference between the OBR's previous estimate in March and its new estimate, from updated post-referendum data:

OBR

The Resolution Foundation says the gap will represent a loss of £72 billion in 2021:

"The economy is now expected to be roughly £42 billion smaller at the start of 2022 than was thought back in March. This downgrade comes on top of the deterioration pencilled in after the Brexit vote of June 2016. As such, the latest GDP projections point to an economy that will be £72 billion (or 3.4 percent) smaller in 2021 than had been projected in March 2016."

That's £72 billion in lost jobs, revenues, consumer spending, and so on.

There are other factors at play, of course. A big one is the UK's chronic lack of productivity, exacerbated by its refusal to allow in the young immigrant workers to generate the income tax receipts its ageing population needs to pay for the NHS and its state pensions.

But the OBR's downward revisions from March to November of this year all come in the post-Brexit-vote period, and the only thing of macroeconomic substance that changed between then and now was the realisation that the UK is headed toward hard Brexit rather than a trade deal that would keep the country closely tied to the single market.-1

A former world champion boxer regrets not punching US president Donald Trump when he had the chance in the 1990s.

American fighter James Toney fought three times at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and had a run-in with Trump when the president called him “Whatshisname.”

Toney also says Trump is a “racist” because of the way activist and former NFL star Colin Kaepernick has been treated.

A former world champion boxer says he regrets not punching US president Donald Trump when he had the chance.

A decorated prizefighter, American boxer James Toney has notable victories over devastating puncher Michael Nunn, heavy hitter Mike McCallum, and former Olympic gold medalist Vassiliy Jirov.

But before Toney became a remowned fighter around the world, he was once on a show promoted by Donald Trump.

Speaking to Donald McRae in The Guardian, Toney recalled an incident when he was competing on the same event as headlining boxer Roy Jones Jr.

Toney took on Doug DeWitt, but before their super middleweight fight in 1992 at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, Trump called Toney “Whatsisname.” The 49-year-old regrets not punching “him in the face.”

He said: “Remember when he was a promoter and he had me and Roy [Jones] on the same bill in Atlantic City. I should have punched him in the face but my mum… stopped me.”

“Trump pointed to me and was saying: ‘Call Whatsisname over here.’ I’m thinking: ‘Whatsisname? I’m your headline attraction and you can’t say my name?’ I said to Trump: ‘I’m going to bust your head open, mother f*****.'”

Toney says he was “pulled away,” but regrets not “knocking his head off and saving the world lots of trouble.”

Getty Images Trump was a boxing promoter in the 1990s and is still seen ringside at modern-day fights.

He also said that the treatment of former San Francisco 49ers quaterback Colin Kaepernick shows that Trump is “a racist.”

Kaepernick protested police brutality against black Americans by bending a knee rather than standing for the pre-game US national anthem.

Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract in March 2017. He is currently a free agent and has not been signed by any NFL side.

Trump has been a vocal opponent of the take-a-knee movement and posted a series of tweets in September.

In an apparent reference to Kaepernick, Trump said that if a player protests the national anthem then club owners should “Get that son of a b**** off the field.”

The Atlantic said Trump’s war of words focused on “black athletes” like Kaepernick. The New Yorker also wrote an article about the “racial demagoguery of Trump’s assault on Kaepernick.”

Toney said: “[Trump is] the president but he’s a racist. That’s why Colin Kaepernick hasn’t got a job. Pure racism from Trump down.”

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/samsung-galaxy-s9-may-appear-at-ces-2018-2017-11Samsung's next flagship smartphone may make an early appearance in JanuaryDrew Angerer/Getty Images Samsung’s DJ Koh at the Galaxy S8’s launch event.

Samsung’s next high-end smartphones, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+, may come earlier than usual.

They may make their first appearance as early as next January, at Las Vegas’ Consumer Electronics Show (CES).

They will reportedly be “iterative” devices, but still pack some new stuff, with a focus on power and overall polish.

Samsung’s new flagship smartphones for the first half of 2018 are already on their way, and may make a super-early appearance at next January’s CES.

The original report, from VentureBeat, mentions that the tentatively named “Galaxy S9” and “Galaxy S9+” will only be “iterative” devices, largely building on the noteworthy, trend-launching, almost bezel-less designs of this year’s S8 duo.

The S9 and S9+ are named “Star 1” and “Star 2” internally, and will reportedly feature the same 5.8- and 6.2-inch Quad HD, AMOLED displays of their respective predecessors.

Processors will apparently get a notable speed boost, however, moving the more energy-efficient 10-nanometre manufacturing process – strongly hinting at Qualcomm’s forthcoming Snapdragon 845, likely in conjunction with a new, in-house made Exynos counterpart for non-US markets.

The added power will also reportedly be coupled with 6GB of RAM, like on the more recent Note 8, as opposed to the 4GB its predecessors had, to better compete with Apple’s increasingly powerful A-line series and stay ahead of the competition in the Android space.

VentureBeat’s sources also say that 64GB of onboard storage will come in the base model, and the microSD card slot will remain, alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack.

The camera will change, instead, moving to a dual lens, vertically aligned setup (like on the iPhone X) that moves the fingerprint reader closer to the middle of the device’s back, in response to the numerous complaints Samsung received with the S8, S8+, and even the Note 8.

Last but not least is DeX, Samsung’s system that allows the S8 to function as a desktop workstation by plugging it into a monitor and keyboard with the support of a custom accessory. The new docking station will keep the phone in a flat position, VentureBeat says, and “utilise the screen as either a touchpad or a virtual keyboard.”

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/aijalon-mahli-gomes-former-north-korea-prisoner-mysteriously-burns-to-death-2017-11An American taken prisoner by North Korea in 2010 was found burning to death in San DiegoA man was found burned to death in San Diego last week.

He turned out to be Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American who was imprisoned in North Korea in 2010.

Gomes was detained after illegally entering the country from China.

Former President Jimmy Carter helped negotiate his release.

San Diego Police are still investigating the death.

An American man who was imprisoned for nine months in North Korea has mysteriously burned to death in San Diego.

Aijalon Mahli Gomes was found ablaze in a dirt field off the Pacific Highway around 11.30 p.m. last Friday, according to the San Diego Union Tribune.

An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer spotted Gomes on fire, running, then collapsing, San Diego Police homicide lieutenant Todd Griffin said on Tuesday. Firefighters and police responded to his calls, but Gomes was pronounced dead at the scene, the Fox 5 San Diego TV station reported.

A preliminary investigation into the death showed that the death was “not a homicide but rather an accidental death or suicide,” Griffin added. Police are still investigating the cause of the fire, The New York Times reported.

Gomes was arrested in January 2010 after crossing into North Korea from China, by walking through a frozen stretch of the Tumen River, according to his memoir, “Violence and Humanity.”

Pyongyang then accused the American, who was 30 at the time, of illegally crossing its border with China.

They also said he had committed an unspecified “hostile act,” and in April 2010 sentenced him to eight years of hard labour and a fine of about $US700,000 (£456,000 at the time).

He remained detained for nine months until former President Jimmy Carter flew to North Korea and negotiated his release in late August that year, the Times said.

It’s unclear what Gomes, then an English teacher in South Korea, was doing in the North. His uncle, Michael Farrow, told CNN at the time that Gomes “may have just been trying to peek in and help others and teach them.”

An Associated Press file photo from January 2010, however, showed him at a human rights protest at the Imjingak Pavilion, near the Panmunjom demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas.

According to Gomes’s book, he endured “psychological torment of interrogation and confinement” under detention.

He also tried to commit suicide during that time, which included slitting his wrists and trying to starve himself, according to the San Diego Tribune, which cited Gomes’s mother, Jacqueline McCarthy.

After returning home, McCarthy said Gomes suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, and began “isolating from the family,” opting to communicate via text than in person.

The most recent high-profile case of an American detained in North Korea was that of Otto Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment last year after being accused of trying to steal a poster from his hotel. The 22-year-old was released back to the US this June while in a coma, and died six days after returning home.

Neymar was at his brilliant best as the PSG forward scored twice, created a goal, and “toyed” with Celtic in his club’s 7-1 win.

Rio Ferdinand said Neymar “put on a clinic of how to play exhilarating football” and that it was “a joy to watch.”

Neymar spoke to journalists after the game and paid homage to retired boxer Floyd Mayweather by wearing the American’s branded clothing.

Neymar scored twice in Paris Saint-Germain’s magnificent 7-1 victory over Celtic.

The Ligue 1 leader fell behind due to an early Celtic goal but was merciless in its comeback as Neymar, Edison Cavani, Kylian Mbappé, Marco Veratti, and Dani Alves all piled the pressure onto the Scottish opponents.

Neymar scored two goals, created another, and played pitch-perfect 40-yard passes. According to BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand, Neymar was “toying” with Celtic.

He said: “Neymar put on a clinic of how to play exhilarating football. Speed. Totally toying with the opponents. And [the PSG team] is doing it all with a smile on its faces – it’s a joy to watch.”

Though it was a team effort and there were five different goalscorers in the dominant victory, Neymar played a part in many majestic PSG attacks. He was goalscorer, goal creator, and a creative force who played with a freedom of the pitch.

Even Ferdinand joked that PSG was “taking liberties” with people, reflecting how the club is brushing Champions League teams to the side.

PSG manager Unai Emery lauded Neymar. “He’s extraordinary,”Emery said, according to Goal.com. “He wants to play the games, to be present on the pitch. He makes everyone benefit from his talent.”

Neymar fielded questions from journalists in the media zone after the match. Having previously been linked with a €200 million move to Real Madrid, one media member asked the Brazilian if he would consider leaving PSG.

Dressed in retired boxer Floyd Mayweather’s branded clothing, Neymar slammed the reporter for being “boring” before walking away.

PSG’s next game is against AS Monaco on Sunday.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/iron-ore-price-china-steel-cuts-2017-11Iron ore is suddenly charging higherPhoto: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images

Iron ore spot markets jumped to fresh multi-month highs on Wednesday, powered by strength in Chinese steel prices.

And with futures continuing to rip higher in overnight trade, it looks like that trend may continue today.

According to Metal Bulletin, the price for benchmark 62% fines surged by 4.3% to $65.17 a tonne, its largest increase since November 6.

It now sits at the highest level since September 21.

The strength in the benchmark was mirrored across the grades.

The price for 58% fines rose by 2.3% to $37.08 a tonne while ore with 65% Fe content added 3.2% to $83.40 a tonne.

The surge in spot markets followed yet another strong rally in rebar futures, helping to boost iron ore, coke and coking coal futures as a result.

The May 2018 rebar contract in Shanghai jumped 2.3% to 3,817 yuan, continuing to benefit from tight inventory levels and ongoing steel production cuts in China that are scheduled to run through to mid-March 2018.

Iron ore rode on the coattails of rebar’s surge, adding 2.8% to 498 yuan. Coking coal and coke futures also added more than 4% for the session.

As opposed to steel markets, these commodities appear to be rallying on expectation that demand for raw materials will surge following the conclusion of steel production cuts.

Suggesting that the move in iron ore spot markets may continue today, futures continued to push higher in overnight trade.

Here’s the final scoreboard from Wednesday’s night session.

SHFE Rebar ¥3,825 , 0.82%

DCE Iron Ore ¥508.00 , 3.15%

DCE Coking Coal ¥1,309.00 , 2.79%

DCE Coke ¥2,092.00 , 3.00%

Should futures hold or build upon those gains today when trade begins at midday AEDT, it points to the likelihood that spot markets will continue to push higher today.

Australian online retail sales topped $20 billion in the past 12 months, according to new research from the National Australia Bank.

In the year to September, the bank estimates that online spending rose to $20.8 billion, accounting for around 7% of the dollar value of retail sales at traditional bricks-and-mortar stores.

From a year earlier, online spending increased by 14.2% in percentage terms, above the 12.9% level of a year ago but down on the all-time peak of 31.6% seen in September 2011.

Still rapid but slowing, something the NAB puts down to “the online retail sector’s maturity as well as the weaker Australian dollar”.

By location, sales within Australia grew by 15% over the past year, outpacing that at overseas retailers which increased by a slower 11%.

Here are just some of the other interesting tidbits to come from the NAB’s Online Retail Sales Report:

By sector: Demand for media and takeaway food continues to dominate online spending growth. At 41.1% (year on year), takeaway food had the fastest annual online sales growth in September.

By age: In the month, growth was fastest for those aged 65+ (2.1%), with this age cohort favouring online spend on food and liquor. Growth has also accelerated for the 18-24s, with spending patterns in this age demographic dominated by fashion (21.6%) and media (20.2%).

By state: Over the past year, the contribution to growth in online spending has shifted back towards the eastern states. Around 76% of total online spending in the past year was made by residents in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. However on a per capita basis, residents in ACT, NT, WA and NSW spent more than the national average.

And if you prefer to visualise the trends being seen in the sector, these two infographics from the NAB are chock-full of information.

This one breaks down online sales by location and size of retailer, among others:

And this looks at sales by category, age and location, breaking down the figures by local and international retailers.

Australia’s retail sales report for September, including quarterly volumes which feeds into household consumption in Australian GDP, will be released on Friday, November 4.

https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/11/blade-runner-2049-director-is-still-wrapping-his-head-around-why-it-underperformedBlade Runner 2049 Director Is Still Wrapping His Head Around Why It UnderperformedBlade Runner 2049 was a critical darling, getting a largely raving reception, but audiences didn't seem to reciprocate. The movie had lacklustre success, failing to bring in little more than half its budget domestically. And while it's done better overseas, director Denis Villeneuve is struggling to understand why the movie was such a box office disappointment - though it could be history repeating itself.

Image: Warner Bros.

In an interview with Yahoo! Entertainment, Villeneuve was asked about how he felt about the movie's less-than-stellar performance in the United States over the past month, making little over $US90 million ($118 million) so far. In short, he's still trying to figure it out. As he mentioned in the chat, the movie did well overseas, where it brought in over $US150 million ($197 million), but it isn't enough to make 2049 a commercial hit. Villeneuve said he's having trouble grasping why a movie that was so beloved by critics ended up being rejected by audiences, hypothesising that it could be because the series' universe wasn't familiar enough for people to want to spent time in it, especially since the film was so long (clocking in at nearly three hours long).

Honestly, I don't know because we had the best critics. I'm still digesting it. I had the best critics of my life, I've never had a movie welcome like that, OK? At the same time, the box office in the United States was a disappointment, that's the truth. Because those movies are expensive, and it will still make tons of money but not enough. I think the thing is that it's maybe because people were not familiar enough with the universe, and the fact that the movie's long. I don't know, it's still a mystery to me.

However, the actual reason could be, as Villeneuve later pointed out, that it's simply history repeating itself. The original Blade Runner wasn't a smash, only bringing in $US27 million during its theatrical run, but it's since become one of the most iconic sci-fi films of all time. That seemed to ensure victory for its highly lauded follow-up. Blade Runner 2049 was supposed to be the box office hit that Blade Runner fans insist the original deserved to be. Instead, it might be another situation where the film's legacy is defined well after it came out in theatres.

That's the first thing one of my sons told me: "Papa you honour the first movie until the very end." Because the first movie had the same fate. The original Blade Runner when it came out wasn't a success, and through time became was it is today. I was not looking for that. But what I really am at peace with is the hard core fans that love the first movie really welcome this one, and that for me it means the world.

I suppose we'll have to wait and see what happens over the next 30 years, to see if Blade Runner 2049 truly follows in its predecessor's footsteps. You can watch the entire interview below.

Workers in Italy and Germany plan to strike on Black Friday.

At least 500 from Piacenza, Italy, said they will walk out.

Amazon said it will do its best to fulfil orders without them.

More than 500 Amazon employees in Europe will go on strike on Black Friday in a bid to win higher pay from the retailer, according to trade unions.

Large numbers of employees in Germany and Italy will stay home for one of the busiest shopping days of the year in a bid to win concessions from their employer.

Workers at Amazon’s main Italian distribution hub posted a statement saying that they would walk out after attempts to secure bonuses from management broke down.

They said at least 500 of the 1,600 staff in Piacenza, 45 miles south of Milan, would refuse to work on Black Friday, according to the Reuters news agency. They are also refusing to work overtime until the New Year.

At the same time, workers at six distribution centres in Germany are also due to strike as part of a long-running pay dispute.

The ver.di union is co-ordinating the walkout, and said its members deserve a bigger share of the profits Amazon makes from the holiday.

They did not specify how many workers were due to strike. Business Insider has contacted ver.di to ask for a figure.

According to Reuters, the strike will be the first ever for Italian Amazon workers, though those in Germany have taken action before.

In a statement to Reuters, Amazon in Italy said its focus would be trying to make sure that orders made on and around Black Friday arrive on time.

It added that its workers’ salaries are already high, and they get other benefits including medical insurance and training.

http://www.businessinsider.com/theres-a-high-chance-that-ubers-failure-to-disclose-its-hack-was-illegal-2017-11There's a 'high chance' that Uber's failure to disclose its hack was illegalUber on Tuesday revealed that it had covered up a data breach that took place in 2016, affecting 57 million users.

The company failed to tell authorities around the world and, according to Bloomberg, paid $100,000 to the hackers to cover up the breach, which included names, emails, and phone numbers.

UK authorities have said British users were affected but haven't said how many.

The UK's digital minister, Matt Hancock, said the company probably broke the law — the most damning statement yet from the government.



The questions are piling up on Uber about a data breach that put at least 57 million users at risk but wasn't disclosed by the company.

The ride-hailing company is now under investigation in the US, the UK, and other countries for failing to disclose the hack to authorities and apparently paying hackers to cover up the breach.

Now the UK's digital minister, Matt Hancock, has given the most damning official statement yet on the breach by suggesting the company broke the law by failing to disclose.

Hancock made the comments in Parliament on Thursday. Asked by Labour MP Kevin Brennan whether Uber had broken the law in relation to the breach, Hancock responded that Brennan "asked whether this is illegal under current UK law — that of course is matter for the courts, but I think there's a very high chance that it is."

Neither Hancock nor Brennan went into further detail.

Uber did not specifically respond to Hancock's comments but said in a statement: "We are in the process of notifying various regulatory and government authorities and we expect to have ongoing discussions with them. Until we complete that process we aren't in a position to get into any more details."

Hancock added that it's an "aggravating factor" if a company gets hacked but doesn't tell authorities immediately. That can potentially lead to higher fines, though in the case of the UK's data authority, that's only a maximum of £500,000, or $665,000. Bloomberg on Tuesday reported that Uber had paid the attackers a $100,000 ransom.

"Delaying notification is not acceptable," Hancock said.

The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, has already said it will investigate the breach.

We still don't know how many British users were affected

The ICO has confirmed British users were affected by the hack but hasn't yet given an estimate on how many.

According to Hancock, Uber has handed over information on how many of its UK users were affected by the hack.

But he said the government didn't fully trust the figures.

He said: "In terms of the number, we do not have sufficient confidence in the number we have been told by Uber to go public. We're working with the [National Cyber Security Centre] to have more confidence in that figure."

Hancock pointed out that the number of customers affected by the hack on the US consumer-data giant Equifax turned out to be bigger than originally estimated. The government says it plans to publish its findings in "a matter of days."

It also turns out that the government found out about the hack only from media reports on Tuesday, with Uber giving statements to the press before speaking with UK authorities, Hancock said.

"Uber had failed to tell the UK authorities before they spoke to the media," he said.

"As far as we can tell, it was not a hack perpetrated in the UK. Our role is therefore to at this stage is to understand how UK citizens were affected. We are working with the ICO and the NCSC, and they are talking to the [Federal Trade Commission] and others to get to the bottom of this."

Hancock added that it seemed unlikely that any of the stolen information could be used to steal customers' money.

"At this stage, our initial assessment for Uber customers ... the stolen information is not the sort of information that would allow direct financial crime."-1

A leaked report quotes EU officials as saying the government is in “chaos” over Brexit.

Senior EU figures view Britain’s leading politicians as “unimpressive” and low quality.

Irish government paper notes that Brexit Secretary David Davis had a meeting with the French European affairs minister without mentioning Brexit once.

Prime minister’s spokesperson says the government is working hard on Brexit.

LONDON – A leaked document has revealed the scathing view of senior EU figures about leading politicians in Theresa May’s government

The internal paper by the Irish government’s Department of Foreign Affairs documents scathing assessments of British ministers and EU figures bemoaning “political confusion” in the government contributing to the slow progress of Brexit talks.

One senior official said they were alarmed by “chaos in the Conservative government,” as ministers argue over the correct course to take as the UK leaves the EU, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported.

According to the leaked paper, officials were amazed that Brexit Secretary David Davis had barely mentioned Brexit during a meeting with the French ministers for defence and European Affairs.

This surprised the French ministers, who thought Davis would use the meeting as an opportunity to try and smooth French resistance to negotiations advancing to the next stage.

The Czech Republic’s Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Jakub Dürr told Irish officials “he felt sorry for British Ambassadors around the EU trying to communicate a coherent message when there is political confusion at home.”

In a separate meeting, a minister in the Czech government described Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as “unimpressive” but said that at least he had “avoided any gaffes” during a visit to the country in September.

The report is based on a series of meetings between Irish ambassadors and officials with government officials in ten EU countries and Japan.

It quotes Ian Forrester, the British judge in the European Court of Justice, bemoaning “the quality of politicians in Westminster.”

According to the paper, Forrester went on to wonder whether the British public would view Brexit as “a great mistake” when they realised the reality of what leaving the EU meant for the UK.

The comments will be a worry to Theresa May, as she attempts to break the deadlock in Brexit talks before a crucial European Council summit next month.

EU heads of state will use the meeting to decide if “sufficient progress” has been made on three key issues to allow negotiations to move onto the next stage.

Last week Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that Brexit talks are not even close to progressing to the next stage.

The prime minister’s spokesperson told Business Insider: “I don’t comment on leaked documents but more broadly the government is working hard on preparations for Brexit. You can see that work is ongoing. There are ongoing preparations for all eventualities as spelled out by the chancellor yesterday. On Ireland, I would reiterate there is a good and constructive working relationship with the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach.

“I have not seen the document and I will never comment on leaked documents.”

Liberal Democrat MP and Brexit spokesperson told MPs on Thursday that the report painted a “rather unflattering picture of the UK government’s negotiating skills,” and asked Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom for a debate on the government’s incompetence.

In response, Leadsom told Brake to “stop talking the country down” and said: “We are extremely optimistic about the prospects for the UK as we leave the EU and his constant pessimism is not helping.”

http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-supplier-foxconn-to-stop-using-illegal-intern-labour-on-iphone-x-2017-11Apple supplier Foxconn says it will stop using illegal intern labour to assemble the iPhone XThe Apple supplier Foxconn has admitted to using illegal intern labour to assemble the iPhone X.

Students said they worked 11-hour days, which is a breach of Chinese labour law.

The scandal comes after Apple reportedly faced delays in getting the iPhone X to customers.



The Apple supplier Foxconn has said it will stop using illegal intern labour in its factories that are used to assemble technology products for some of the world's biggest companies, according to a report by BBC News.

Foxconn's use of interns on its production lines was first reported by the Financial Times. Six students told the newspaper that they regularly worked 11-hour shifts assembling Apple's new iPhone X, which is a breach of Chinese labour law. The Financial Times said a group of 3,000 interns worked in Foxconn's factories.

The students, who were reportedly ages 17 to 19, told the Financial Times that their work at Foxconn was work experience that they had to do to complete their education.

Now, Foxconn has told BBC News it has ended its practice of letting interns work overtime. The company reportedly said it took "immediate action to ensure that no interns are carrying out any overtime work," and it said interns represented "a very small percentage" of its overall workforce.

Apple told BBC News it was "dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve." It continued: "We know our work is never done and we'll continue to do all we can to make a positive impact and protect workers in our supply chain."

It's an embarrassing story for Apple, which has regularly faced criticism over the supply chain of its products. Apple had to ask the Chinese mining company Huayou to stop using child labour after Sky News found it was using children as young as 4 to mine for the material.

Foxconn has faced its own issues in the past: In 2010 a series of employees died in suicides after working long hours in the factory, which eventually led the company to erect suicide nets on its buildings designed to prevent future deaths.

The iPhone X faced production problems

The KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo covers Apple's supply chain in Asia and regularly covered delays with the iPhone X. He said Apple faced shortages on key components of the device, which meant it struggled to get the phones it needed ready for when it went on sale.

Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about the potential of delays to the iPhone X in an interview with BuzzFeed. The executive gave a rather diplomatic answer: "We'll see what happens, but we'll be working as hard as possible to make as many as possible."1

Farquharson attended the £35,000-a-year private Rugby School in England.



The 19-year-old daughter of former US President Barack Obama, Malia Obama, is reportedly dating the son of a British investment manager.

After TMZ published a video of Malia Obama kissing a man during the Harvard-Yale football game over the weekend, the Daily Mail identified him as Rory Farquharson, who was head boy at a £35,000-a-year ($47,000-a-year) private school in England.

Farquharson, 19, began his studies at Harvard last year, according to Rugby School, an English private school he attended, where a term's education costs up to £11,584.

Here's Farquharson pictured in June:

He was a golf and rugby player and was selected as "head of school" for the 2015-16 year. A school friend told the Daily Mail that he was "popular" and "quite a catch."

Farquharson's CV says he spent a summer as an intern with the Centre for Democracy and Peace Building in Northern Ireland, appeared in a rugby video played at the World Cup opening ceremony in 2015 (which Prince Harry also appeared in), and was a member of the Rugby School's chemistry club, the Blue Bunsen Society.

The family live in a six-bed detached home in Woodbridge, Suffolk, worth £1.6 million, The Telegraph reported.

Farquharson had also appeared to criticize US President Donald Trump on Twitter, according to The Telegraph. The Daily Mail reported, however, that Farquharson followed the current president on Twitter but did not follow Barack Obama.0

The Tesla founder made a bet on Twitter with Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes in March that Musk would supply the battery within 100 days or it was free.

Musk said that if he failed to meet the deadline, the project would have cost him "$50 million or more."



Elon Musk will get paid for building the world's largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, as the 100-megawatt project is about to begin testing ahead of a December 1 deadline to complete building it or make it free.

State premier Jay Weatherill announced on Thursday that regulatory testing at the site — which is paired with the French energy business Neoen's Hornsdale wind farm, 230 kilometres north of Australia's capital, Adelaide — would begin within days.

When fully charged, the battery, Tesla's Powerpack, is expected to hold enough power for 8,000 homes for 24 hours, or more than 30,000 houses for an hour during a blackout.

The project is part of a $550 million plan by the state to guarantee energy supply following a statewide blackout last year that turned into a national political debate over energy security and costs. A 250-megawatt gas-fired generator, expected to cost $360 million, is also due to come online this summer to provide extra power.

The battery is the result of a Twitter bet between the Tesla founder and Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes in March that he would supply the battery within 100 days or it was free. The clock began ticking when Musk visited Adelaide in September to sign off on the deal — though work was already underway on the plant after the government gave the contract to Musk in July.

Musk had said that if he failed to meet the deadline, it would have cost him "probably $50 million or more."

The Tesla plant will be called upon during periods of "load shedding," when excess demand would otherwise result in blackouts.

Weatherill said that the battery was now complete and that the testing would ensure it is optimised and meets energy market regulatory requirements.

"It sends the clearest message that South Australia will be a leader in renewable energy with battery storage," he said. "An enormous amount of work has gone into delivering this project in such a short time, and I look forward to visiting Jamestown next week to personally thank those who have worked on this project."

http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-uk-is-on-course-for-longest-fall-in-living-standards-since-records-began-2017-11The UK is on course for longest fall in living standards since records beganStark new report shows the UK faces the lowest productivity growth since 1812.

Resolution Foundation Budget analysis shows Britain is on course for the longest period of falling living standards since the 1950s.

Treasury analysis finds poorest households will be hit hardest by long-term policy.



LONDON — The United Kingdom is on course for its longest period of falling living standards since records began in the 1950s, analysis published following the Budget has found.

The report published by the Resolution Foundation titled "Freshly Squeezed" says that there is a "bleak outlook" for Britain's families, as living standards fall for the longest period ever documented.

The analysis shows that average wages will not return to their 2007 peak until 2025, three years later than was forecast in the Budget in March of this year.

The think tank also found that the Office of Budget Responsibility handed Philip Hammond the biggest downgrade to productivity forecasts since its creation in 2010, as the OBR slashed its growth forecasts for the UK economy as well.

The chancellor announced that GDP growth forecasts had been revised down every year until 2021, including from 2% to 1.5% in 2017, partly due to waning productivity but also due to uncertainty over Brexit.

The report shows that productivity growth will be at just 0.1% by the end of 2017, which would make this the worst decade for productivity growth since 1812 when Britain was in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars.

Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation said: "Following years of incremental changes, yesterday the OBR handed down the mother of all economic downgrades pushing up borrowing for the Treasury.

“While Philip Hammond chose to take a relaxed approach to additional borrowing, families are unlikely to do so when it comes to the deeply troubling outlook for their living standards that the Budget numbers set out.

"Families are now projected to be in the early stages of the longest period of continuous falls in disposable incomes in over 60 years – longer even than that following the financial crisis."

Real household disposable incomes are set to fall for an unprecedented 19 successive quarters between 2015 and 2020, according to the foundation.

The report also criticised the government's announcement that stamp duty would be abolished for first time buyers on houses up to £300,000, suggesting that the £3 billion cost of the measure could have supported the building of 40,000 social rented properties or 140,000 homes through the Housing Infrastructure Fund.

The foundation's analysis shows that the policy is set to cost £160,000 for every new homeowner created, which would have been sufficient to buy people typically priced properties in over a quarter of English and Welsh local authorities.

Bell said: "On the substance of the Budget the Chancellor has made the right call in boosting housing investment and focusing on this key issue of intergenerational concern. However, yesterday’s stamp duty rabbit is in reality a very poor way to boost home ownership. Its £3bn cost could have been better spent building 140,000 new homes through the government’s own Housing Investment Fund.

“Faced with a grim economic backdrop the Chancellor will see this Budget as a political success. But that would be cold comfort for Britain’s families given the bleak outlook it paints for their living standards."

Budget will hit poorer households harder in long-term

Analysis from the Treasury shows that the budget will have a harder long-term impact on the poorest households the most, through changes to tax, welfare and public spending.

The government's own household impact assessment documents show that those in the bottom income brackets will be affected the most by policy changes, as well as those at the very top. Both groups will lose nearly 2% of their net incomes by 2019/20.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told HuffPost that Hammond was "revising people’s wages and living standards down."

He said: "The poorest tenth of households will lose about 10% of their income by 2022, while the richest will lose just 1%.

"So much for ‘tackling burning injustices’. This government is tossing fuel on the fire."-1

The "BLAST" course takes place over three days and costs £800.

Previous students have gone on to work on blockbuster movies like "Transformers" and "Star Wars."

This is what Hollywood stuntman training looks like. The BLAST course – short for "British Live Action Stunt Training" – takes place in Purfleet, London over three days.

The course is lead by Andreas Petrides, founder of the British Action Academy and stunt coordinator who has worked on films such as "Star Wars: Episode 1" and "28 Days Later".

http://www.businessinsider.com/difference-between-sweet-potato-and-yam-2017-10The yams you've been eating are probably sweet potatoes — here's how to tell the differenceYams and sweet potatoes are not the same thing. In fact, you've probably bought a sweet potato, thinking it was yam!

There are many types of sweet potatoes ranging from white, yellow, red, purple, or brown on the outside with white, yellow, orange, and reddish flesh inside. There are also sweet potatoes that soften during cooking and those that stay firm.

When softer sweet potatoes first hit the market in the US, growers needed a way to differentiate between the two. The soft sweet potatoes resembled African yams, so growers just started calling them yams.

In reality, yams are much starchier and drier than sweet potatoes. They also aren't as sweet.

They're usually only found in international grocery stores so you would have to go out of your way to find them.

Confusingly, growers do still label some sweet potatoes yams but the USDA requires those labels to also mention that they're really just a type of sweet potato.

So next time you shop for "yams," looks closely, you might be in for a "sweet" (potato) surprise!

http://www.businessinsider.com/why-some-people-turn-red-drink-alcohol-2017-4The disturbing reason some people turn red when they drink alcoholSome people will have their face turn extremely red when they drink alcohol, and it is not a good sign. Those who do turn red after drinking alcohol have a condition called alcohol flush reaction. They're literally poisoning their bodies whenever they drink. Following is a transcript of the video.

Here's why some people turn red when they drink. It's a condition called "alcohol flush reaction." Side effects include flushed skin, nausea, headache, and rapid heart beat.

The cause is a buildup of acetaldehyde in the body. Acetaldehyde is highly toxic and a known carcinogen. When alcohol hits the liver, it metabolizes into acetaldehyde.

Usually, it's quickly converted to a safer form, acetate. But people with alcohol flush reaction are different. Their body turns alcohol into acetaldehyde faster. But their liver takes more time to turn acetaldehyde into acetate.

The results are: A less intense "buzz," harsher side effects from acetaldehyde poisoning, and long-term, a higher risk of mouth and throat cancers.

Alcohol flush reaction is a genetic condition. It's thought to originate among the Han Chinese, in central China. Over the centuries, it has spread throughout East Asia. An estimated 1/3 of East Asians have it.

Since the condition is genetic, there is no cure. The upside? Those afflicted often avoid excessive drinking and alcoholism.

Some Facebook users will be able to see which Russia-linked pages they interacted with on the social network.

Facebook still won't tell users whether the propaganda they saw was a paid ad or a post in their News Feed.

Facebook on Wednesday said it would let some of its users see whether they liked or followed pages belonging to Russia-linked operatives that sought to sow political divisiveness around the 2016 US presidential election.

A new page to be published on Facebook's help center by the end of the year will show whether some accounts interacted with the Russia-linked accounts, Facebook said in a blog post.

"This is part of our ongoing effort to protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy," Facebook said.

Roughly 150 million Facebook users saw posts shared by pages belonging to the Russian propaganda organization known as the Internet Research Agency, Facebook previously told US investigators.

While Facebook will show some users the affiliated pages they liked or followed, the company maintains that technical and privacy reasons keep it from showing whether such propaganda was shown as a paid ad or as a post in the News Feed.

Facebook's move to disclose more about such activity on its platform to users follows Twitter's announced plan to create a public hub that allows anyone to see all ads running on its platform and how they are targeted. Facebook already announced plans to let users see who is behind ads run on its network, but Tuesday's announcement marks the first time the company committed to showing people non-paid posts affiliated with Russia.0
https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-economic-cost-of-brexit-in-gdp-2017-11£72 BILLION: The cost of Brexit is already turning Britain into a second-rung nation(Photo by Christopher Furlong – WPA Pool/Getty Images) Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond prepares his speech in his office in Downing Street ahead of the 2017 budget announcement.

Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost economic activity annually, according to an analysis of government figures.

Leaving the EU is already dragging down the British economy.

The UK is now growing more slowly than Japan or Italy.

LONDON – Chancellor Philip Hammond’s annual budget, presented yesterday, has finally given Britain the first concrete numbers on the cost of Brexit.

The government’s Office for Budget Responsibility published revised GDP growth numbers based on data following the June 2016 referendum. Those new estimates suggest that Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost annual economic activity by 2021, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation.

Previously, the best estimate of the economic damage leaving Europe will inflict on the UK came from a private estimate by one of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis’s advisors, of about £22 billion per year, mostly from extra trade tariffs and barriers.

Here are the new GDP charts from the OBR.

They show other major economies such as the US, the EU, and Canada all growing faster now than they were in the six months prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016. Only in the UK has growth slowed, as the pound lost value and investors hit the pause button. Even Japan, an infamous economic basket case hobbled by years of stagnation, is doing better than the UK:

OBR

In terms of sequential GDP growth through Q3 2017, Britain now lags France and debt-ridden Italy, too. This chart comes from Pantheon Macroeconomics:

Pantheon Macroeconomics

This next chart shows how much we are forecast to lose in GDP activity every year, based on the difference between the OBR’s previous estimate in March and its new estimate, from updated post-referendum data:

OBR

The Resolution Foundation says the gap will represent a loss of £72 billion in 2021:

“The economy is now expected to be roughly £42 billion smaller at the start of 2022 than was thought back in March. This downgrade comes on top of the deterioration pencilled in after the Brexit vote of June 2016. As such, the latest GDP projections point to an economy that will be £72 billion (or 3.4 per cent) smaller in 2021 than had been projected in March 2016.”

That’s £72 billion in lost jobs, revenues, consumer spending, and so on.

There are other factors at play, of course. A big one is the UK’s chronic lack of productivity, exacerbated by its refusal to allow in the young immigrant workers to generate the income tax receipts its ageing population needs to pay for the NHS and its state pensions.

But the OBR’s downward revisions from March to November of this year all come in the post-Brexit-vote period, and the only thing of macroeconomic substance that changed between then and now was the realisation that the UK is headed toward hard Brexit rather than a trade deal that would keep the country closely tied to the single market.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-20-best-smartphones-in-the-world-2017-11The 20 best smartphones in the worldAntonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider

The gap between good and great smartphones is getting smaller and smaller, and ranking smartphones is becoming harder and harder.

There’s a lot to consider here, such as specs, features, design, and price. Thankfully, most of these smartphones come with more than enough power, great designs, and tons of features.

The biggest thing to watch out for in the next month is price. Phones like the OnePlus 5T and Essential Phone cost as little as $US500, and there isn’t a huge difference between them and the $US800-plus phones on this list. Prices of big-name smartphones are increasing, but the moderately priced premium Android phone is clearly making a comeback, and it’s better than ever.

Check out the top 20 smartphones you can buy.

20. BlackBerry Classic

BlackBerry

If you’re still a BlackBerry fan, you’ll love the Classic. It looks like older BlackBerry models but features a sharp touchscreen and an excellent physical keyboard.

Price: $US240

19. Sony XZ Premium

Jeff Dunn/Business Insider

Jeff Dunn, my former colleague, reviewed this phone for Business Insider, and he summed it up perfectly:

On the one hand, “this is a good phone,” he wrote.”The screen is great, the software is clean, and the whole thing is superfast.”

But on the other, “with its underwhelming battery and slippery, sometimes uncomfortable design, it’s not the device that should reverse Sony’s fortunes.”

Previously priced at $US800, the XZ Premium is now available for less than $US600 on Amazon, which makes it easier to live with its shortcomings.

Price: $US570

18. BlackBerry KeyOne

Jeff Dunn/Business Insider

The KeyOne is BlackBerry’s successor to the Priv. Both run Android and feature physical keyboards. But while the Priv’s keyboard slid out from behind its screen, the KeyOne’s is permanently located just below its display.

The KeyOne is a great device for those who want a physical keyboard and access to Google’s apps and services, which aren’t available on other BlackBerry devices.

Price: $US500

17. Motorola Moto G5 Plus

Business Insider/Jeff Dunn

The Moto G5 Plus continues to be our favourite budget-friendly Android smartphone. It demonstrates that “good-but-not-great hardware can become strong value at the right price,” as Dunn said in his review.

With the G5 Plus, you get a 5.2-inch 1080p screen, a fingerprint scanner, great battery life, a 12-megapixel camera that beats those of other phones in its price range, a nearly pristine version of Android, and a sleek design. All for a mere $US230.

It doesn’t have as many features as premium phones. For example, it doesn’t have an NFC antenna, so it can’t be used for mobile payments. And to charge the G5 Plus, you’ll have to use a microUSB cable – it doesn’t support USB-C, the newer, faster phone-charging standard.

Price: $US230

16. Motorola Moto G5S Plus

The Moto G5S Plus is an upgrade from the G5 Plus.

The newer phone features an all-metal design, whereas the previous one has a half-metal, half-plastic case. And the new phone has a bigger screen – a 5.5-inch display versus 5.2-inch one.

But one of the biggest improvements is in the camera. The G5S Plus has a 13-megapixel dual-lens camera system.

Price: $US280

15. Motorola Moto Z2 Force

The new Moto Z2 Force comes with everything you’d expect from a premium smartphone. As Dunn noted in his review, it’s “very fast, its screen looks good, its cameras are capable of taking nice photos, and it has a razor-thin frame.” And its 5.5-inch Amoled display is more resistant to cracking than most other smartphones’ screens.

However, the Z2 Force is a little too reliant on Motorola’s Mods – the company’s line of snap-on accessories, including external speakers and bigger batteries, designed for its Z-series phones. Without such Mods, the Z2 Force doesn’t feel like a complete-enough device to push it higher on this list.

Price: $US720

14. Apple iPhone SE/6s/6s Plus

Apple

I grouped all these together, because they’re all two years old, have similar specs, and are still available from Apple. They’re also still amazing smartphones. Apple recently released iOS 11, the latest version of its mobile operating system, and my iPhone 6s Plus still runs great with it.

The SE, 6s, and 6s Plus all feature great cameras and Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which allows you to quickly unlock your phone. Another bonus: These are the last iPhones that still have headphone jacks.

These phones are even better if you buy them refurbished at a deep discount from Apple.

Price: iPhone SE $US350

Price: iPhone 6s $US450

Price: iPhone 6s Plus $US550

13. HTC U11

Jeff Dunn/Business Insider

The U11 has an excellent camera, an eye-catching reflective back, and speedy performance. And it has a fun feature that allows you to squeeze its edges to open any app you want, including Google Assistant.

In most respects, it’s a great Android smartphone. But it has two notable shortcomings – it lacks a headphone jack and the borders around its display are relatively large, something that now looks “old-fashioned” in terms of design.

Price: $US650

12. LG G6

Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider

The G6 is LG’s best smartphone, and it’s truly great. With it, LG is finally offering a phone with a premium design and water resistance – features that put the G6 in the same league as Samsung and Apple’s flagship devices.

The G6 has a good dual-lens camera. It also has a slightly longer than average screen that’s great for viewing and using apps, because it shows more of them than a standard display.

But the G6 has one notable downside – an older processor. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip was superseded by the Snapdragon 835 just two months after the G6 launched. Unlike the G6, Samsung’s Galaxy S8, one of its chief rivals, has the newer chip.

While the Snapdragon 821 is still a great processor, its likely to become obsolete sooner than its successor, and the G6 is likely to start seeming slower sooner than the Galaxy S8.

Price: $US545

11. Essential Phone

Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider

The Essential Phone is a gorgeous device. It has a mostly edge-to-edge display and a case made of ultra-premium materials – ceramic on the back and titanium on the sides. It also runs a near-stock version of Android, which I prefer over the heavily modified versions that Samsung and LG phones tend to use.

Overall, the Phone is a great first effort from Essential. It’s a speedy performer, and it takes great photos, too. It has two magnetic pins on its back that serve as a connection point for peripherals including a 360-degree camera and a wireless charging dock.

Essential recently dropped the price of the Phone from $US700 to $US500. That’s a great deal for a great phone.

Price: $US500

10. Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+

Business Insider

The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are among the best looking smartphone out right now. It’s better looking than Apple’s iPhone 8, and it’s sleeker than Samsung’s Note 8.

With the S8 and S8+, Samsung took the curved glass design it used with the S7 and refined it. Meanwhile, the ultra-narrow borders around the S8’s screen make it the new standard for premium smartphone design.

In addition to their good looks, the Galaxy S8 phones are also full of great features. They’re water resistant. They have taller-than-average screens that allow you to see more of your apps or web pages. They supports both fast and wireless charging, and face and iris recognition. They have one of the best cameras, and unlike Apple Pay or Android Pay, Samsung Pay wireless payments service work on pretty much every credit card reader. The home button is also hidden beneath the display, so it’s familiar to use compared to new phones that have ditched the home button entirely.

With all those attributes, you’re likely wondering why the S8 phones didn’t make the top of this list. Here’s why: I’m not a fan of TouchWiz, Samsung’s software interface that runs on top of Android. I prefer the clean look and features of stock Android.

But it’s more than a simple personal preference. Modifications like TouchWiz almost always prevent the phones running them from installing the latest Android updates when they’re released. And that’s the case here.

The S8 phones do rely on TouchWiz for face and iris recognition capabilities. But those features don’t make up for their likely inability to install timely Android updates.

Price: Galaxy S8 $US638

Price: Galaxy S8+ $US704

9. Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus

Hollis Johnson/Business Insider

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are now a year old, but at their new $US550 and $US670 price tags, they easily beats the Galaxy S8 phones.

Apple phones generally offer better apps and a better owner experience than their Android rivals, and the iPhone 7 is no different. The support you get from Apple if something goes wrong is much better than what you get from Android device makers. And unlike on most Android phones, with iPhones you can always get the latest software updates straight from Apple as soon as it releases them.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus offer some compelling features, including a water-resistant case, a great camera that performs well in low light, and a powerful processor. It also works really well with other Apple products, including the company’s wireless AirPods headphones.

The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-lens camera systems is the key feature. It allows you to take pictures with a professional-looking “bokeh” effect, which blurs the background behind the photo’s subject. The second camera in its system is a telephoto lens that offers a 2x optical zoom. Unlike the digital zoom feature found in other cameras, an optical zoom allows you to enlarge an image of your subject without sacrificing picture quality.

Price: $US550

Price: $US670

8. Razer Phone

The Razer Phone is marketed as a “gaming” phone, mostly because of its unique display that plays games incredibly smoothly. Indeed, the Razer Phone’s display can achieve up to 120 frames per second (fps), whereas most phones only go up to 60 fps. Having twice the fps makes for super-smooth gameplay.

But high fps isn’t just for gamers. The Android operating system running on the Razer Phone, as well as apps, gets the high fps treatment, too, and it works beautifully. Everything you do on the phone is ultra-smooth in a way that we’ve never seen before on a smartphone. In fact, Razer may have inadvertently set a new standard for how all phone displays should work moving forward, not just gaming phones.

It also has an eye-catching industrial design compared to most sleek and svelte Android phones. The large bezels above and below the Razer Phone’s display may not appeal to everyone, especially since most phones in 2017 have switched over to bezel-less designs. However, hiding beneath those massive bezels are the loudest and best smartphone speakers we’ve heard on any smartphone.

Price: $US700

7. Samsung Galaxy Note 8

Sarah Jacobs/Business Insider

With its gorgeous design, the ultra-thin borders around its screen, its beautiful display, fast performance, dual-lens camera system, and fancy stylus-based features, the Note 8 takes the best attributes of Samsung’s Galaxy S and Note smartphone lines and smashes them together into a phone that’s hard to beat.

Price: $US920

6. OnePlus 5T

Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider

If you’re not looking to spend $US850 or more on a large-screened phone, the OnePlus 5T is the Android phone to get. It’s truly a fantastic phone that’s only made better by its incredible $US500 starting price.

It also comes with more RAM than any other smartphone we’ve tried, which guarantees top performance. On top of that, its camera is great and comes with a portrait mode that competes with the iPhone X and Pixel 2 phones. And, my personal favourite feature, it runs a near-stock version of Android.

Price: $US500

5. Google Pixel 2

Google

The Pixel 2 might not be the most beautiful Android phone you can buy, but its secret weapon is its pure Android experience.

The device runs the latest version of the operating system. Because it’s unadulterated, that version looks and runs better than any of the tweaked takes on Android other phone makers include with their devices.

Better yet, because the Pixel 2’s Android is unmodified, you’ll be able to install the latest updates to the operating system as soon as Google rolls them out. That’s not something you can usually do with other Android phones. It’s something I feel is important because who doesn’t want the latest software from the top software company in the world?

But the Pixel 2 has other features that help put it ahead of other Android devices, including its amazingly good camera, excellent performance, and great battery life. It’s like a less attractive but smarter Samsung Galaxy phone.

The Pixel 2 is also water resistant, unlike its predecessor, the original Pixel. But while we rated that device higher than last year’s iPhone 7, the new device doesn’t out rate the new iPhone 8. While the iPhone 8 supports wireless charging and ships with a set of headphones, the Pixel 2 offers neither.

Price: $US650

4. Google Pixel 2 XL

Google

The Pixel 2 XL has nearly the same components and features that make the Pixel 2 great, but it comes in a bigger package with a larger display and an updated, fresher-looking design. The Pixel 2 XL isn’t the best looking Android phone, but with the narrow borders around its screen, it looks sleeker and more refined than its smaller sibling or its predecessors from last year.

And the unadulterated Android experience it offers is unbeatable.

You should note, though, that users and reviewers have reported encountering several different problems with the Pixel 2 XL, mostly with its screen. I haven’t experienced any of the reported problems while testing my review unit, so I’m not factoring them into the phone’s ranking.

Users were also complaining that colours on the Pixel 2 XL’s display weren’t as vibrant as other top Android phones. Google has recently issued an update that makes colours more vibrant.

Price: $US850

3. Apple iPhone 8

Hollis Johnson/Business Insider

Google’s original Pixel phones topped last year’s iPhone 7. But now that the iPhones are here, Apple is back on top.

The iPhone 8 comes with a refined glass and metal case, a superb camera, and incredible performance. With it, Apple is finally supporting both wireless and fast charging – features that Android phones have long offered but had been missing from previous iPhones.

What pushes the iPhone 8 ahead of the Android pack is its iOS operating system and the broader Apple ecosystem. You can get the latest updates straight from Apple as soon as they’re released, iOS apps are generally better designed than their Android counterparts, and if something goes wrong with your phone, you can get help at one of the hundreds of Apple stores.

Price: $US700

2. Apple iPhone 8 Plus

Hollis Johnson/Business Insider

The iPhone 8 Plus includes all the best things about the iPhone 8. But it adds to those a bigger, better screen and a dual-lens camera system that features a telephoto lens and the ability to take shots similar to those you could capture with a professional camera.

Price: $US800

1. iPhone X

Hollis Johnson/Business Insider

It’s undeniable. The iPhone X offers the best of the iPhone and Apple ecosystem along with the best design in a smartphone we’ve ever seen.

With its outrageously beautiful OLED display that takes up most of the front of the phone, wireless charging, and fast charging, the iPhone X has brought Apple’s iPhones up to speed with top-of-the-line Android hardware. Indeed, Android owners always enjoyed the latest smartphone hardware features until now.

It will cost you $US1,000 minimum, but that’s the price of near perfection in a smartphone.

Price: $US1,000

http://www.businessinsider.com/study-trump-news-media-bias-negative-stories-2017-10This is how different media outlets covered Trump's first 100 days in officeA study released last month found that news coverage of President Donald Trump's first months in office differed significantly among outlets with right- and left-leaning audiences.

It also found that early news coverage of the Trump administration was much more negative than that of other modern presidencies.



A Pew Research Center study released last month found that news coverage of President Donald Trump's first months was significantly different among outlets with right-leaning audiences and those with left-leaning or ideologically diverse audiences.

Overall, Trump's early media coverage was much more negative than early coverage of other modern presidencies.

While Trump constantly admonishes the press, calling it "fake news" and "the enemy of the American people," and attacks individual reporters, some of his aides, including top counselor Kellyanne Conway, have focused their complaints on the preponderance of negative stories about the administration. Conway says the media provides "incomplete coverage" of Trump, failing to report on the more positive stories and choosing political over policy coverage.

"I think we need a full and free press in our nation, of course,” Conway said at conference last month. "But with that freedom comes responsibility. So my grievance is never about fake news. I talk about incomplete coverage."

The Pew study found that while news outlets — regardless of the political leanings of their audiences — largely reported on the same issues, and similarly focused on character and leadership rather than policy, during the first months of the Trump administration, they included different types of sources and assessed the president differently.

Overall, news stories concerning Trump's first 100 days were four times more likely to provide a negative assessment than a positive one, making his coverage far more negative than that of his predecessors.

Just 5% of media coverage of Trump's first 60 days was positive, compared to 42% of President Barack Obama's coverage, 22% of President George W. Bush's coverage, and 27% of stories about President Bill Clinton.

Pew also found discrepancies between outlets with right-leaning audiences versus those with left-leaning or ideologically diverse audiences. Those with more conservative readers and viewers were less likely to cite multiple types of sources, included more positive and fewer negative assessments of Trump, and their reporters were less likely to challenge an assertion made by the president or the administration.

The vast majority of stories from other outlets cited multiple source types, including experts, administration officials, and lawmakers, and were double as likely to include comments from both Democratic and Republican members of Congress.

The study assessed more than 3,000 television, radio, and web stories from 24 outlets over the course of Trump's first 100 days in office.

Welcome to the internet, where incredulity and paranoia loom large. Here, you'll find no shortage of theories expounding on the non-existence of celebrities and detailed analysis on the many ways in which we've been lied to by the government (which, in turn, has been lied to by the elite reptile overlords who really rule the earth).

Here are a few of the strangest ideologies currently occupying the web:

1. Melania Trump has a doppelganger who follows the president around on official business.

In October, several people took to Twitter to question the real identity of the woman trailing behind the president during a White House press chat. Twitter users compared side by side photos of the "real Melania" and the "Melania double" and came to an official assessment: there's a slightly shorter First Lady lookalike.

2. J.K. Rowling doesn't actually exist.

In 2005, Norwegian filmmaker Nina Grünfeld argued that the Harry Potter series had been created by an entire industry of writers, and that the woman known as J.K. Rowling was only a front. "Is it possible that a person can write six thick books that are translated into 55 languages and sell more than 250 million copies in less than 10 years?" Grünfeld asked.

3. Finland doesn't exist either.

This theory evolved on Reddit in 2015, when a user called "Raregans" suggested that Finland was a fabricated landmass, dreamed up by the Japanese and Soviet Union during the Cold War in an effort to secure fishing rights in the Baltic Sea. Raregans suggested the people who populate the country known as Finland actually belong to the nations of Sweden, Estonia, and Russia.

4. An elite cohort of reptiles rule the earth, and Justin Bieber is among them.

A Public Policy Survey in 2016 found that nearly 12 million people believe that an elite class of space-traveling lizards rule the earth. Among these lizards is Justin Bieber, who was reported earlier this year shape-shifting mid-concert into a giant reptile with "big scaly claws" and "a black stripe down its middle."

5. Queen Elizabeth is a cannibal.

Ever wondered how the queen of England has managed to live so long? British historian Hubert Humdinger has the answer: "She must eat human flesh to be so vivacious." In 2012, the site Dear Dirty America claimed to have "confirmed" Humdinger's reports when a serviceman at Windsor Castle claimed to discover human remains inside the queen's "private freezer."

6. The ice bucket challenge was really a Satanic ritual.

When the ice bucket challenge began circulating the web in 2014, a number of suspicious theories came with it. Several critics took to YouTube hoping to reveal the true motivations behind the challenge, with many of them claiming the ALS benefit was a ritual purification cleansing for what would be the largest human sacrifice in history, part of a hidden Illuminati code passed down by Satan himself.

7. NASA knows about a second sun, and they've hidden it from us.

When NASA reported the discovery of a Planet 9 in 2016, astronomer Paul Cox took to the internet to speculate that the planet was actually a second sun. In a live video posted to a robotic telescope service site called Slooh, Cox examined Mercury's transits and pointed out a second sun. "NASA and other organizations, they usually hide that stuff away from us," Cox said. "They don't tell us the truth, but there it is."

8. Michelle Obama is a man, and s/he murdered Joan Rivers.

InfoWars' Alex Jones came up with this theory up in 2016: After Joan Rivers joked that Michelle Obama was a transgender woman, the Obamas had her assassinated.

9. The earth is flat.

After the solar eclipse in August, a number of flat-earth conspiracists, or "flat earthers," took to the internet to disprove the spherical shape of the planet. The theory is experiencing a modern-day resurgence, with flat-earther YouTube channels and subreddits like /r/flatearth flourishing with thousands of members online.

11. The UN is plotting to kill us all.

For years, a UN-backed sustainable development plan called Agenda 21 has faced suspicious criticism: According to a large spectrum of the internet, Agenda 21 is really the Illuminati's covert plan to kill off the majority of the earth's population.

12. Robert Kardashian and Ted Cruz are the same person.

This conspiracy claims Robert Kardashian isn't actually dead, but rather he's just been traipsing around in the guise of Ted Cruz in order to sever ties with the Kardashian clan and enter into a career in politics.-1

Designer Franz von Holzhausen had an impressive resume before joining Tesla.

But the combination of his frustration with the traditional auto industry and Elon Musk's distinctive ideas about how to solve problems has taken his work to a new level.

He's followed an unlikely path to becoming the most influential car designer of his generation.

Before Franz von Holzhausen signed on with what was then called Tesla Motors in 2008, he was on his way to being a member of the automotive design world's elite.

He had graduated from Art Center College of Design in the early 1990s, making him an alumnus of the world's most prestigious transportation design program, counting among its graduates the likes of J. Mays, Chris Bangle, and Henrik Fisker.

At General Motors, he designed a pair of exquisite roadsters, the Pontiac Solstice the Saturn Sky. From there he went to Mazda North America, where he ran the entire show and garnered praise for his concept vehicles.

If von Holzhausen had remained on that track, he would have been a car-design aristocrat. Instead, he took a huge leap of faith and joined a buzzy Silicon Valley startup, far from the automotive capitals in Michigan, Japan, and Germany. And he became the most influential designer of his generation.

Yes, I know that's a big statement. Jaguar's Ian Callum or Aston Martin's Marek Reichman might object, and Luc Donckerwolke is capturing plenty of attention for his work at Hyundai, following a stint designing Lamborghinis.

But the key factor for von Holzhausen is that as Tesla rolls out its Model 3 sedan, attacking the mass market, he's witnessing the return on his risky decision to join CEO Elon Musk back when Tesla was selling only one car, the original Roadster. Many designers of high reputation who are about von Holzhausen's age (he's 49) continue to imagine the future within the context of the past.

Von Holzhausen gets to envision the future on its own terms - gorgeous electric cars that will someday be able to drive themselves. The car designer of the coming decades might admire the legends of the profession's history (and there have been many). But when it comes to crafting a career and a reputation, they will look to Holzhausen.

I recently got the chance to speak with von Holzhausen and he shared some details about how he came to join Tesla and what guides his design philosophy.

Correction: An earlier version of this post said that von Holzhausen joined Tesla in 2010; he joined in 2008.

It was von Holzhausen, not Musk, who was the budding superstar back in the late 2000s.

source Wikimedia Commons

When von Holzhausen joined Tesla in 2008, the company was contending with a near-bankruptcy. The company had only a single vehicle to sell - the Lotus-based Roadster - and although it had stoked enthusiasm with all-electric cars that were fast and sexy and would raise $226 million in an IPO after von Holzhausen arrived, the carmaker lived on the edge of a knife.

Even though the traditional auto industry had endured its own near-death experience during the financial crisis, by 2010 General Motors had staged its own IPO, returning to the public markets after a government bailout and bankruptcy. Moribund auto sales had begun a recovery, and other electric-car startups were showing the strains of introducing new technologies; most would fail. A lot of experts figured Tesla would be out of business in a few years, as the cost of launching new vehicles killed the company.

But von Holzhausen was frustrated with the traditional industry and ready to leave Mazda. A few chats and meetings with Musk proved that the experienced designer and the entrepreneur with a designer's sensibility were on the same page, sharing vision and values.

For von Holzhausen, it was Musk's and Tesla's absolute commitment that cinched the deal. Musk has said that he and von Holzhausen share the same taste, so beyond that critical aspect of the relationship, it boiled down to how serious Musk was about completely remaking the landscape of transportation.

The bottom line for von Holzhausen?

"Tesla was all in," he said in an interview with Business Insider.

Von Holzhausen mission was to create a "world-class design competency" for Tesla. The company's first car was cool, but the Roadster was based on a Lotus design. Von Holzhausen would have the nearly unique opportunity to start from scratch.

source Tesla

Tesla's roadmap, drawn up by Musk, was straightforward. The company had to first create an exciting electric car that would change the impressions that EVs were glorified golf carts. That car would be sold at a high price to early adopters and fans of high-performance, exotic sports cars.

The money would fund additional, luxurious, pricey electric vehicles, and that money would provide the funding for the first major endgame: a mass-market vehicle intended to bring long-range electric mobility to the masses.

The Roadster's Lotus underpinnings meant that when those ran out, Tesla would need a new car. For von Holzhausen, going to work at Tesla's earliest design studio in Hawthorne, CA, at SpaceX headquarters, that meant about two years to come up with a new vehicle - a rare opportunity to pen a "clean sheet" design.

Roadster production would phase out by 2012. And regardless, Tesla had to start selling a more versatile lineup of vehicles. While a snazzy two-seater was fun to drive and thrilling to look at - more so when you realized you were running only on electrons - people wanted to buy sedans and SUVs.

Von Holzhausen had a lot of work ahead of him.

Tesla zigged rather than zagged with the Model S, which was revealed in 2011 and went on sale the following year. And von Holzhausen introduced his own design philosophy.

source Tesla

The auto industry is over a century old. Tesla is the first new carmaker to emerge in decades. So it's just about the rarest thing imaginable for a car designer to be able to imagine a new vehicle without feeling the explicit burden of the past. Just try to sketch a new Mustang at Ford or Corvette at Chevy.

Tesla was announcing itself as a real car company with the Model S, so von Holzhausen knew that his ideas would define the visual vocabulary of numerous vehicles to follow: SUVs, sports cars, coupés, probably even pickup trucks and vans. The whole tamale.

A lot of designers would have let it rip and tried to be the next Giorgetto Giugiaro, the crucial Italian designer of Ferraris, Alfa Romeos, and Maseratis. In a sense, von Holzhausen did become the next Guigaro, minus the more flamboyant efforts. Giugiaro designed dozen of cars, and not all of them made viewers automatically weak in the knees.

Von Holzhausen let Musk be his guide. Musk embraces something called "first principles thinking" and has made it into a mantra at Tesla. The idea is to avoid thinking by analogy - let's make this car look like that car, just sort of different or better - and instead deal with problems by stripping them down to the core and working your way up.

Von Holzhausen's version of this has been to embrace what he calls "efficiency." He assumes that every Tesla has to be beautiful, and besides, making a piece of industrial design beautiful doesn't really cost anything. It's more a matter of choosing beauty as a first principle because, in a competitive market, the best-looking product stands out.

With efficiency, von Holzhausen had a concept that could inform not just the design of the Model S sedan but also the entire, evolving Tesla brand.

The Model S embodies radical restraint. It draws attention without demanding attention. For von Holzhausen, it's a vision of the future that just about anyone can understand.

source Tesla

It's also representative of von Holzhausen's restrained approach at Tesla. The Model S essentially looks the same as it did when it debuted. The main update was to the front end, when Tesla eliminated a faux-grille nose cones and went with a smooth treatment.

With an electric car, there's no need for a traditional grille because there's no internal-combustion engine to feed with oxygen or cool with airflow and a radiator.

The relatively conservative nature of a Tesla's exteriors is echoed inside. But predictably, there's a radical approach tucked away in here, too.

source Tesla

The entire interior of all Tesla's is organized around a large central touchscreen that controls almost all vehicle functions. It's even slanted slightly toward the driver for better viewing.

To be honest, although it looks spectacular, it isn't always as functional as what you experience in vehicles that have retained knobs, switches, and buttons. But it doesn't matter. What Tesla, von Holzhausen, and the company's design team - including Musk - recognized is that a gigantic screen would reinforce the impression that Tesla's are about technology.

Nobody else in the auto industry has put a screen this big in a car. You can't avoid it when you slip behind the wheel or plop down in the passenger seat, so it automatically reinforces Tesla's branding.

The Model X was von Holzhausen's second all-original design for Tesla.

source Tesla

But the Model X is something of a conundrum.

source Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

On one hand, it's an extension of von Holzhausen's design language to the larger shape of an SUV. On the other, it's a departure from the efficiency philosophy because although the design is streamlined, the engineering isn't.

Tesla overdid it, by admission, with the Model X. The vehicle was delayed for years before launching in 2015, beset with problems: the falcon-wing doors had to to redesigned, rear-seat production was brought in-house, and the vehicle faced recalls not long after it hit the market.

But the Model X is greater than the sum of its parts or flaws. It's easily the most technologically advanced vehicle currently on the road, and although von Holzhausen didn't depart from the Model X template, he showed that it was flexible enough to work on the two most important genres in the luxury space.

Von Holzhausen's third effort for Tesla was the Model 3.

caption Tesla Model 3. source Timothy Artman/Tesla

The Model 3 really is a triumph. The Model S design scaled up beautifully for the Model X, but beauty doesn't always scale down. Not so with the Model 3, which manages to be more modest than the relatively big Model S without being a squashed-down version of that car.

This is the key to von Holzhausen's influence. He's the rare professional who's creating both a physically specific piece of industrial design while also developing an overall visual impression, which could be identified as the Tesla brand.

The only other carmaker that has consistently done this is Porsche, building on the basic original look of the 911 sports car. Von Holzhausen's efficiency approach is particularly evident on this front. If it doesn't evoke Tesla, he takes it away.

And that taking away extends inside the Model 3.

source Tesla

Von Holzhausen makes no bones about it: The Model 3's ultra-minimalist interior - completely defined by a horizontal version of the Tesla touchscreen - anticipates a day when cars won't need controls for human drivers.

The Model 3's majestically uncluttered dashboard is the most striking influential thing I've ever seen in an automobile. You can look at the picture, but it's hard to describe the experience of getting behind the wheel and seeing absolutely nothing that you're used to.

And then you go ahead and drive the car and within seconds, it all makes sense. What von Holzhausen has achieved here is a three-part user interface: beautiful exterior, minimalist interior, and North Star for the entire Tesla brand.

That Franz von Holzhausen — the unlikeliest superhero to ever take up the task of designing cars.

source Getty Images/Jason Merritt/TERM

I've probably talked to car designers more than I've talked to anyone else in the automotive profession. To a one, they're impressive, but von Holzhausen is at another level.

The crazy thing is that although he had done great work before Tesla, he didn't have the right context for his considerable talents before he paired up with Musk's carmaker. He was willing to take a risk, and now he's enjoying the results. Tesla has certainly endured its ups and downs, but von Holzhausen is universally admired for his designs.

As Tesla continues to move forward, he'll be even more admired for his unique ideas not just about what cars should look like, but how they should make our lives better.

And one more thing ...

Well, even Franz gives in to a little car-designer temptation from time to time. Sedans and SUVs are fine, but sometimes you want to create a road-going rocket that can do 0-60 mph in less than two seconds. Behold the all-new Tesla Roadster, revealed last Thursday night.0

Mitchells & Butlers reports 18% fall in profits as fall in the pound pushes up costs.

Shares fall 10% at the open but have since recovered slightly.

LONDON – Shares in pub and restaurant owner Mitchells & Butlers are falling on Thursday morning after the company reported a steep fall in profits and warned of Brexit-related headwinds.

Mitchells & Butlers, which owns chains such as All Bar One, Toby Carvery, Harvesters, and Nicholson’s pubs, said that pre-tax profit for the year fell 18% to £77 million. Revenue rose 4.5% to £2.1 billion but rising costs meant the company failed to capitalise on rising sales.

“Cost headwinds across the industry have adversely affected margins but we continue to work hard to mitigate as much of these as possible through our focus on efficiency and profitable sales growth,” CEO Phil Urban said.

Mitchells & Butlers blamed the “unprecedented cost headwinds” on the collapse in the value of the pound after last year’s Brexit referendum. The pound fell to a 31-year-low against the dollar and a 7-year-low against the euro in the wake of the June 2016 vote.

The company also warns that Brexit could impact its business in three key ways in the future:

by depressing consumer confidence;

changes in employment and immigration laws;

and further changes in sterling impacting on input costs.

Mitchells & Butlers’ share price fell 10% at the open in London and remains over 8% lower at 9.30 a.m. GMT (4.30 a.m. ET).

Markets Insider

Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said in an email: “Investors are clearly focusing on cost issues affecting the whole industry. These include the living wage, business rates, apprenticeship levy, sugar tax, restaurant discounting, changes in consumer habits (eating out less frequently, but spending more) and Brexit uncertainty.

“An early decision not to pay an interim dividend, pending a year-end assessment, also suggests a murky outlook that is sapping management confidence.”

Mitchells & Butlers’ warning on rising costs comes in stark contrast to JD Wetherspoon. Tim Martin, the founder of the pub chain and a staunch Brexit supporter, said that a “hard Brexit” would “reduce the average cost of a meal by about 3.5 pence and the cost of a drink by 0.5 pence” at one of his pubs.

Mothercare falls to a half-year loss as international operations weigh on the business.

CEO warns of recent "softening in the UK market."

Shares crash 17% at the open, as investors remain jittery about UK retail.

LONDON - Mothercare has become the latest British retailer to warn of difficult trading conditions, sending shares crashing 17% at the open on Thursday.

Mothercare published half-year results on Thursday, showing it slipped to a loss of £700,000 in the first six months of the year, compared to a £5.9 million profit in the first six months of last year.

UK sales rose 2.5% in the period but international performance dragged the business down. International sales fell 8% and Mothercare CEO Mark Newton-Jones said there is "no clear sight as to when things will bottom out" in the Middle East, its worst performing region.

Mothercare shares crashed 17% at the open and remain around 15% lower after 20 minutes of trade in London:

While international weakness is the main reason behind Mothercare's poor performance, the baby and toddler retailer warned that it is starting to see issues in the UK, its core market.

Newton-Jones said: "Towards the end of the reporting period, and in subsequent weeks, we have seen a softening in the UK market with lower footfall and spend which is consistent with recent industry reports."

Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb says in an email: "City analysts will no doubt be getting their red pens out as they re-jig their P&L models," on the back of Newton-Jones' comment.

Retail goliaths John Lewis and Next are among the many shops to have warned of tough trading conditions this year and recent Visa/IHS Markit data showed the fastest fall in consumer spending for four years, as inflation hits people in their pockets. Visa warned on Monday that it expects Christmas spending to fall for the first time in half a decade this year.-1
http://www.businessinsider.com/joe-barton-nude-photo-leak-revenge-porn-police-investigation-2017-11Capitol Police are reportedly investigating leaked nude photo of a Texas GOP lawmakerA sexually explicit image of Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas surfaced on the internet on Tuesday.

Barton says the Capitol Hill police are investigating.

Barton reportedly once warned a woman that he would contact the police if she didn't stop communicating with other women he was previously romantically involved with.



The Washington Post on Wednesday said it had reviewed a 2015 recording of Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas warning a woman who received "inappropriate photographs and videos" of him that he might report the matter to the Capitol Hill police. An anonymous Twitter account published a lewd photo photo of Barton on Tuesday.

In a recording of the call, The Post said, Barton confronted the woman after she was discovered to have communicated with other women who were romantically involved with Barton. The woman is also believed to have forwarded explicit materials from Barton to the other women.

"I want your word that this ends," Barton said in the recording, according to The Post. "I will be completely straight with you. I am ready if I have to, I don't want to, but I should take all this crap to the Capitol Hill Police and have them launch an investigation. And if I do that, that hurts me potentially big time."

Barton reportedly continued, saying he would detail all of their exchanges to the police, including material he said he did not want to be publicly disclosed.

"You still apparently had all of those and were in position to use them in a way that would negatively affect my career," Barton reportedly said.

If the woman shared explicit images of Barton, that may violate Texas laws prohibiting "revenge porn," in which people publicize such material without consent as a form of retaliation, The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday. Violators could face a year in jail and up to a $4,000 fine.

On Wednesday, Barton said in a statement that the Capitol Police would launch an investigation into the incident. The Capitol Police could not be reached by Business Insider for comment Wednesday evening.

"When I ended that relationship, she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation," Barton said, according to The Post.

The woman said she was in contact with Barton for five years, beginning in 2011, after she published a message on his Facebook page, according to The Post. Among the sexually explicit material he sent the woman was reportedly a video of him masturbating, which The Post said appeared to be the source of the photo released on Twitter on Tuesday. The woman interviewed by The Post said she did not publish the photo.

Barton, who said the two had a consensual relationship, was still married when they became romantically involved, according to The Post.-1

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Since 2009, Amazon has sold a variety of products through AmazonBasics. Its generic brand covers everything from tech and fitness to dining supplies. The goal is to give you the most bang for your buck, and while their products might not be as flashy as their competitors', they get the job done. They're also significantly cheaper, and if you can get a solid product in a major category for less, it's definitely worth it. I've used some AmazonBasics products before, and in some cases, check if they have something before looking at the rest of the market. So I've sorted through the handful of AmazonBasics gadgets you can feel comfortable buying for less. None of them will ever be flashy, but, like an imitative box of cereal, they’ll get the job done. You might save some cash along the way, too. View As: One Page Slides

Laptop and monitor stands My apartment (and life, for that matter) is full of little gadgets, but I'm actually kind of an organization freak. One of the ways I keep my desk at home clean is by using a laptop stand. Mine holds my laptop vertically, but there are benefits to the horizontal-style stand here. The biggest is that you can keep your laptop's display open and have a dual-monitor setup, which, if you're a multitasker, is a game changer. At work I use a stack of books to keep my monitor propped up, but I may end up investing in one of these monitor stands. Besides being way more stable than a handful of paperbacks, Amazon's stand is hollow, so I can store things underneath it.

Multi-port wall chargers If you live in a house with multiple people, chances are you've argued once or twice about who gets to charge their phone first. Instead, buy this four-port charger and let everyone charge their devices at once. Pair it with some of the cables mentioned in the previous slide and you'll be able to keep all of your gadgets and accessories fully charged without breaking the bank. AmazonBasics 4-Port USB Wall Charger, $15.78

Computer speakers They're not going to be as powerful or clear as a high-end pair of computer speakers from AudioEngine, or even Logitech. But if you want better-than-laptop-speaker audio quality, either of these speakers will do that. Amazon's speakers come in two flavors: powered or USB, and there are a couple of differences between the two to keep in mind. The powered speakers are a little more powerful at 5 watts versus 3 watts on the USB model. Another advantage of the powered speakers is that they have a built-in headphone jack, so you can plug your headphones into them instead of your computer. That's actually a pretty nice feature if you keep your computer docked all the time. Again, these aren't for the audiophiles, but if you're in need of a cheap pair of computer speakers, either of these pairs will fit the bill.

On-ear headphones There are a handful of nondescript headphones sold under the AmazonBasics brand, but the only pair you should consider picking up is its Lightweight On-Ear Headphone. Another boring name, yes, but it has a surprisingly competent, bass-heavy sound that really has no business being on a $15 headphone. Now, it certainly looks that cheap. With its dull, all-black, all-plastic frame, it’s not the kind of thing you’d get as a gift. Still, it’s not uncomfortable either. It’s reminiscent of a similar on-ear pair from Monoprice, which sounds more accurate and spacious but is also out of stock as of this writing. For a beater pair you can bring on the run, or a backup you can hang on to when your main headphones go out of whack, this is a good choice.

AmazonBasics Lightweight On-Ear Headphones, $12.99

Paper shredders We live in a very digital world, but important documents still get sent through the mail. Getting your sensitive information stolen can lead to years-long battles to erase, which is why everyone should have a paper shredder. This AmazonBasics model will cut up your paper and old credit cards, so you'll never have to worry about someone else shopping on your dime. AmazonBasics 6-Sheet Cross-Cut Paper and Credit Card Shredder, $29.99

Surge protectors I can tell you from personal experience: If you care about your electronics, plug them into a surge protector. This-two pack can protect your gadgets from 200 joules of power and each surge protector has six outlets. That's probably enough to keep your entire computer or home entertainment setup safe from a sudden power surge. AmazonBasics 6-Outlet Surge Protector Power Strip 2-Pack, $11.490

In less than two months, allegations of sexual misconduct have spread from industry to industry, with fresh stories from the media, politics, and entertainment surfacing on a near daily basis. Revered members of the entertainment industry like Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey, and Louis C.K., along with politicians such as Senator Al Franken, and candidate Roy Moore have been accused of varying degrees of sexual misconduct. Here's a list of men who have been accused of sexual misconduct since news of the Weinstein allegations broke: View As: One Page Slides

Actor Ben Affleck The actress Hilarie Burton accused Ben Affleck of groping her breast during a 2003 interview. Burton tweeted a video of the interview and wrote: "Girls. I'm so impressed with you brave ones. I had to laugh back then so I wouldn't cry. Sending love."





Affleck tweeted an apology to Burton, saying he had "acted inappropriately." The makeup artist Annamarie Tendler in a tweet also accused Affleck of groping her during a Golden Globes party in 2014. Affleck has not responded to Tendler's tweet. A representative for Affleck declined a request for comment from Business Insider.

Former head of Amazon Studios Roy Price In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the film producer Isa Hackett alleged that Roy Price, the former head of Amazon Studios, sexually harassed her while they were promoting the series "The Man in the High Castle" in 2015. Hackett worked as an executive producer on the series based on her father's book. Hackett said she met Price on July 10, 2015, at San Diego's Comic-Con to promote the series with him and that he invited her to an Amazon staff party that evening. She and Price shared a cab to the party, where Hackett said Price told her, "You will love my d--k." Hackett said she declined Price's advances but that the inappropriate behavior persisted throughout the evening. Hackett said she reported Price's behavior to Amazon immediately. After the interview was published, Amazon suspended Price indefinitely, and he resigned soon after. Price has yet to publicly address either the allegations or his resignation.

Producer Bob Weinstein Amanda Segel, the former executive producer of "The Mist," accused Bob Weinstein of consistently making unwanted advances on her in an interview with Variety. Segel said that while working with Weinstein on the TV series, he continued to ask her out to dinner despite her repeatedly telling him she was uninterested in a romantic relationship. Segal said his advances stopped only once she told The Weinstein Company, which was producing "The Mist," that she would leave the series if his behavior continued. "'No' should be enough," Segel said. "After 'no,' anybody who has asked you out should just move on. Bob kept referring to me that he wanted to have a friendship. He didn't want a friendship. He wanted more than that. My hope is that 'no' is enough from now on." Weinstein's lawyer, Bert Fields, released a statement to Variety denying Segel's allegations. "There is no way in the world that Bob Weinstein is guilty of sexual harassment, and even if you believed what this person asserts, there is no way it would amount to that," Fields said. Weinstein did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Former editor at The New Republic, Leon Wieseltier Leon Wieseltier, a former editor of The New Republic, has been accused by many of his former female colleagues of sexually harassing them and making crude sexual comments to them, The New York Times reported. In a statement to The Times, Wieseltier asked for his former colleagues' "forgiveness." "The women with whom I worked are smart and good people," Wieseltier said. "I am ashamed to know that I made any of them feel demeaned and disrespected. I assure them I will not waste this reckoning." Wieseltier did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Celebrity chef John Besh One of John Besh's former employees, who had a sexual relationship with the celebrity chef, said in a complaint that he once "continued to attempt to coerce" her "to submit to his sexual overtures," The Times-Picayune published in an investigative report. Twenty-five women have also said they were sexually harassed by male coworkers and bosses while working in Besh's restaurants, the news outlet reported. Besh said in a statement that he felt the relationship with his former employee was consensual. The chef also said he apologized to those he had worked with in the "past and present" who found his behavior "unacceptable." Besh did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Director James Toback The director James Toback has been accused by over 200 women of sexual harassment or assault, the Los Angeles Times reported. Toback is accused of inviting women to have interviews or auditions with him and then either dry-hump them or masturbate in front of them without their consent. The actress Julianne Moore tweeted that Toback asked her to "audition" for him in the 1980s, but that she turned him down on two separate occasions.





Toback has not responded to these accusations, but he told a Rolling Stone reporter before the Times story came out that some of the allegations against him that the reporter had heard were "idiotic." A former agent for Toback did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Prominent tech figure Robert Scoble Three women have accused the prominent tech figure Robert Scoble, a former Microsoft employee, of sexual and verbal harassment from 2009 to 2014. Michelle Greer told BuzzFeed News that in 2010, while she was working with Scoble at Rackspace, he touched her inappropriately at the Startup Riot conference. "I remember seeing him with two drinks in his hand," she said. "My boss sat next to me, and Scoble sits across from me and starts touching my leg." The journalist Quinn Norton described a similar experience with Scoble in 2010 at the hacker conference Foo Camp in a Medium post. "And then, without any more warning, Scoble was on me," she wrote. "I felt one hand on my breast and his arm reaching around and grabbing my butt." Sarah Kunst, a startup founder, also tweeted that she had reported Scoble's "bad behavior years ago."





Scoble released a statement on his personal website on Wednesday denying all sexual-harassment allegations against him. "If I were guilty of all the things said about me I would still not be in a position to have sexually harassed anyone," Scoble said. "I don’t have employees, I don’t cut checks for investment. None of the women who came forward were ever in a position where I could make or break their careers. Sexual harassment requires that I have such power."

Animator, producer, and director Chris Savino Multiple women have accused Chris Savino, the creator of the animated series "The Loud House," of sexually harassing them, The Hollywood Reporter said. Nickelodeon fired Savino as the news broke. Savino posted a public apology on Facebook; it has since been removed. "I am deeply sorry and I am ashamed. Although it was never my intention, I now understand the impact of my actions and communications created an uncomfortable environment," Savino said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. "At every stage of my career, I have sought to uplift my colleagues and cultivate a culture of respect. In this objective, I have failed. I should have known better, I should have acted better, and this has been a difficult, but valuable lesson." Savino said he had the "deepest respect for the bravery of the women who have spoken out." A representative for Savino declined a request for comment from Business Insider.

Magician David Blaine In an interview with The Daily Beast, the model Natasha Prince, David Blaine's ex-girlfriend, accused the magician of raping her in London in 2004. Scotland Yard said in a statement to the news outlet that it is investigating Prince's allegation. Blaine's attorney, Marty Singer, released a statement to The Daily Beast denying Prince's accusation. "My client vehemently denies that he raped or sexually assaulted any woman, ever, and he specifically denies raping a woman in 2004," Singer said. Singer added that "if, in fact, there is any police investigation, my client will fully cooperate because he has nothing to hide." Blaine did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Director Roman Polanski Marianne Barnard has accused the director Roman Polanksi of molesting her in 1975, when she was 10 years old. Barnard tweeted: "#RomanPolanski took photos of me naked & in fur coat on beach in Malibu, I was 10 yrs old. He went on from there. This ends now #ROSEARMY."





In an interview with The Sun, Barnard described her encounter with the director and explained why she decided to come forward with her story now. "I felt terribly conflicted that I have been silent all this time and all these women are bravely coming forward, and I thought to myself I can't, in good conscience, knowing what I know — and having gone through what I've gone through — not speak out," Barnard said. Barnard has since reported the incident to the Los Angeles Police Department and is petitioning to remove the director from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, The Sun reported. Polanski pleaded guilty to statutory rape charges in 1977 in the US but fled to Europe upon realizing his plea bargain was unlikely to be accepted. Polanski has remained in Europe and has not returned to the US since then. In a statement to Business Insider on behalf of the director, Polanski's public-relations officer said, "I entirely reject the unfounded allegations of Mme. Barnard, of whom I have no knowledge."

Musician R. Kelly R. Kelly's former girlfriend Kitti Jones said in an interview with Rolling Stone that the rapper physically abused her and forced her to have sex with other women from 2011 to 2013. Jones had also been a part of a story published by BuzzFeed in July that said R. Kelly had formed an abusive "cult" of six women. A representative for R. Kelly released a statement to Rolling Stone denying Jones' claims. "It is unfortunate that Ms. Jones, after public statements to the contrary, is now attempting to portray a relationship history with Mr. Kelly as anything other than consensual involvement between two adults," the statement said. "As stated previously, Mr. Kelly does not control the decision-making or force the actions of any other human being, including Ms. Jones, by her own admission." R. Kelly did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Musician Ethan Kath Alice Glass shared an emotional post on her website that said she had endured "almost a decade of abuse, manipulation and psychological control" by her former Crystal Castles bandmate Ethan Kath that began when she was 15. "Over a period of many months, he gave me drugs and alcohol and had sex with me in an abandoned room at an apartment he managed," she wrote. "It wasn't always consensual and he remained sober whenever we were together." Glass left Crystal Castles in 2014 and was replaced by Edith Frances. "I am outraged and hurt by the recent statements made by Alice about me and our prior relationship," Kath said in a statement to Pitchfork, via his attorney. "Her story is pure fiction and I am consulting my lawyers as to my legal options. Fortunately, there are many witnesses who can and will confirm that I was never abusive to Alice." Kath confirmed his statement to Business Insider and sent a screenshot of an Instagram message he said Glass' sister sent a "fan" saying she did not believe Glass' allegations. The same screenshot is also on a Tumblr page called Castle Grayskull. Glass did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Musician Twiggy Ramirez A former girlfriend of Twiggy Ramirez, the bassist in the band Marilyn Manson, has accused him of sexually and physically abusing her. In a Facebook post, Jessicka Addams said Ramirez punched and raped her while they were in a relationship in the early 1990s. Manson has announced he "decided to part ways with Jeordie White," Ramirez's legal name.





Ramirez said in a statement that he does not "condone non-consensual sex of any kind," Rolling Stone reported. "I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety," he said. "If I have caused anyone pain I apologize and truly regret it."

Former President George H.W. Bush The actress Heather Lind said in a lengthy Instagram post, which has since been deleted, that former President George H.W. Bush "sexually assaulted" her. A representative for Bush said in a statement to the Daily Mail, "President Bush would never — under any circumstance — intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologizes if his attempt at humor offended Ms. Lind." The actress Jordana Grolnick told Deadspin that she had also been groped by the former president. Grolnick said that in 2016 she was performing in the play "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and that Bush came backstage after the performance to take a photo with the cast. "We all circled around him and Barbara for a photo, and I was right next to him," Grolnick told Deadspin. "He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, 'Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?' As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, 'David Cop-a-Feel!'" In a statement to Deadspin, Bush's spokesman Jim McGrath said, "At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures." McGrath also apologized on behalf of the former president and said that "the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner." "Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate," McGrath said. The author Christina Baker Kline also said in an article published on Slate that the former president groped her during a photo op in 2014. Kline said she had been invited to a fundraiser for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and that when she and two other male writers were gathering to take a photo with Bush, he pulled her aside. Kline said Bush asked her, "You wanna know my favorite book?" and that he responded, "David Cop-a-Feel." Kline said Bush "squeezed my butt, hard, just as the photographer snapped the photo." The author also said that after while leaving the fundraiser and recounting to her husband what had happened, a friend of the Bush family who was driving them asked her to be "discreet." Roslyn Corrigan told TIME that Bush groped her buttocks during a photo op when she was 16 and he was 79. Maine Senate Republican candidate Amanda Staples, and retired New York Times reporter Liz Allen have also accused the former president of groping them, according to TIME.

Fashion designer Gianni Versace In an interview on the podcast "The Adam Carolla Show," the actor Kevin Sorbo accused Gianni Versace of sexually harassing him. Sorbo said that while he was working as a model in the '90s, the fashion designer invited him to dinner parties, and that one time when they were alone, Versace told Sorbo he was interested in using him in one of his campaigns. Sorbo said Versace then put his hand up his leg. Sorbo said he told Versace he wasn't interested. The actor said Versace responded: "In life, you must f--- everything. You must do the dog, and the cat, and the boy, and the girl." Sorbo later told The Hollywood Reporter that he had remained friends with Versace over the years but never ended up in any of his campaigns. The designer died in 1997.

Former NBC News political analyst Mark Halperin Five women have accused the journalist Mark Halperin of sexually harassing them during his time at ABC News, CNN reported. Four of the five women told CNN that they had worked with Halperin in some capacity while he was at the network. One woman told CNN that she had been invited to meet with Halperin in the early 2000s — when he was the political director of ABC News — and that he had forcibly kissed her, pressed his genitals against her, and grabbed her breasts. "I went up to have a soda and talk and — he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs," the woman said. "I just froze. I didn't know what to do." The other women who spoke to CNN similarly said Halperin had pressed his body and genitals against them without their consent. Three of the women said they felt Halperin had propositioned them for sex by inviting them back to his hotel room or, in one case, inviting her into a bathroom with him. In a statement to CNN, Halperin said he "did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me." But Halperin denied that he had pressed his genitals against any of the women or grabbed a woman's breasts. "I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize," Halperin said in the statement. "Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation." MSNBC — the host of "Morning Joe," which Halperin regularly appears on — told CNN in a statement that it found the allegations "very troubling." "Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood," the statement said. ABC News said in a statement to CNN, "Mark left ABC News over a decade ago, and no complaints were filed during his tenure."

E! News correspondent Ken Baker Two women have accused the E! News correspondent Ken Baker of sexually harassing them, The Wrap reported. A former E! News employee said that in 2012 Baker invited her into his office and asked her to sit on his lap. A former intern at the outlet told The Wrap that in 2011 Baker kissed her without her consent and continued over a few weeks to solicit her for sex. She also said that in 2015 she received texts from Baker saying he wanted to give her "a Tiffany dildo" with his name "engraved on the shaft." In a statement to The Wrap, Baker said he was "very disturbed by these anonymous allegations" and that they made his "heart ache." "I care deeply for people's feelings and sincerely live in a way that treats people with dignity and respect," Baker said. Baker did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Director and producer Rick Najera Rick Najera, the director of CBS's Diversity Sketch Comedy Showcase, left the network amid allegations of sexual harassment, Variety reported. A CBS spokesman said in a statement to Variety that the network first became aware in March of "inappropriate comments made during the production of the Diversity Comedy Showcase." The spokesman said "remedial action was taken" that CBS deemed "appropriate to the matter." However, CBS said that new information emerged recently and prompted it to reinvestigate Najera's behavior, and that Najera had resigned. A source told Variety that two new complaints had been reported to CBS. Variety reported that one performer said Najera told them in 2009 that he was in an open relationship with his wife and insinuated he was interested in having a relationship, and that another said Najera made inappropriate remarks to them in 2014. The actress Rachel Bloom confirmed to Variety that she had heard about Najera's alleged behavior at the showcase and sent an email asking participants to come forward. A representative for Najera sent Business Insider a link to a public statement from Najera and his family saying they are "heartbroken and confounded by deliberate and cruel defamations." "It's unbelievable that a diversity program I directed and we supported for more than a decade would be twisted against me," the statement said. "As we wrestle with our reactions to this attack, I want to remind people that I've spent my whole life not only making people laugh — but showcasing our shared humanity." The statement continued: "This is now the most painful and unjust situation that I — and my family — have ever experienced."

Actor Kevin Spacey The "Star Trek: Discovery" actor Anthony Rapp accused Kevin Spacey of making a sexual advance on him when Rapp was 14 in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Rapp said that when he and Spacey were starring in a Broadway play in 1986, Spacey invited him to a party at his apartment in Manhattan. Rapp said Spacey found him watching TV alone in a bedroom, then put him on a bed and lay on top of him. "I still to this day can't wrap my head around so many aspects of it," Rapp said. "It's just deeply confusing to me." Spacey said in a statement on Twitter that he did "not remember the encounter" but that if it happened it "would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior." Spacey also said he had "loved and had romantic encounters with men" and that he now chooses "to live as a gay man." Spacey was widely criticized for coming out as a gay man in his apology.





Actor Roberto Cavazos has also accused Spacey of sexual misconduct. In a Facebook post, Cavazos said the actor tried to touch him without his consent in London's Old Vic Theatre in 2008. "There are many of us who have a 'Kevin Spacey story,'" Cavazos said in the post, written in Spanish. "It seems the only requirement was to be a male under the age of 30 for Mr Spacey to feel free to touch us. It was so common that it became a local joke (of very bad taste)." In a statement the Old Vic said, "This is clearly unacceptable and the Old Vic truly apologises for not creating an environment or culture where people felt able to speak freely." Netflix suspended production of season six of "House of Cards" before it ultimately decided to fire Spacey from the production. Since Rapp and Cavazos came forward with their allegations against Spacey, numerous other men have made accusations against the actor, including one anonymous man who alleged that he and Spacey had a sexual relationship when he was 14. The Old Vic Theatre opened an investigation into Spacey following Cavazos' allegation, and has since found "20 personal testimonies" of "alleged inappropriate behavior," according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sixteen staff members and four additional people came forward with allegations against Spacey, with incidents that occurred from 1995 to 2013. Spacey was the artistic director of the theater from 2004 until 2015. Spacey's representative said in a statement: "Kevin Spacey is taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment. No other information is available at this time."

Actor Jeremy Piven The reality-TV actress Ariane Bellamar said on Twitter that Jeremy Piven groped her while she was on the set of HBO's "Entourage." In a series of tweets, Bellamar said the actor cornered and grabbed her.





Piven denied Bellamar's accusations in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. "It takes a great deal of courage for victims to come forward with their histories, and my hope is that the allegations about me that didn’t happen, do not detract from stories that should be heard," Piven said. A representative for CBS, whose new series "Wisdom of the Crowd" Piven stars in, said the network was aware of the accusations and was "looking into the matter." "Longmire" actress Cassidy Freeman accused of Piven of engaging in "predatory behavior," in an Instagram post (which has since been deleted). "I know what you did and attempted to do to me when I was far too young," she wrote. Tiffany Bacon Scourby alleged that in 2003 Piven pinned her down and ejaculated on her in his hotel room, in an interview with People. Piven denied Scourby's claims in a statement to People: “Let me be absolutely clear, this simply did not happen. I would never force myself on a woman, ever. I cannot speak as to why a person would create a story like this.” Piven released a lengthy statement on Twitter Thursday, denying all of the accusations against him, and offering to take a polygraph test. “We seem to be entering dark times — allegations are being printed as facts and lives are being put in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence," Piven said. "I hope we can give people the benefit of a doubt before we rush to judgment.” Piven did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Director Brett Ratner Six women, including the actress Olivia Munn, have accused Brett Ratner of sexual misconduct, the Los Angeles Times reported. Munn said the director masturbated in front of her on the set of the movie "After the Sunset" in 2004. She said that when she went to deliver food to his trailer, "he walked out ... with his belly sticking out, no pants on, shrimp cocktail in one hand and he was furiously masturbating in the other." She continued: "And before I literally could even figure out where to escape or where to look, he ejaculated." Munn wrote about the alleged incident in her book, "Suck It, Wonder Woman! The Misadventures of a Hollywood Geek," though she did not name Ratner. The actress Natasha Henstridge told the Times that Ratner had forced her to perform oral sex on him in the '90s when she was 19. "He strong-armed me in a real way. He physically forced himself on me," Henstridge said. "At some point, I gave in and he did his thing." Ratner's lawyer said the director denied these claims. Extras on Ratner's movie "Rush Hour 2" have also accused the director of sexual harassment. His lawyer said Ratner had no recollection of doing so. In a statement to Business Insider on behalf of the director, Ratner's lawyer said Ratner "vehemently denies the outrageous derogatory allegations that have been reported about him" and was "confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims." An additional statement was sent to Business Insider from Ratner's lawyers stating that the director would be stepping away from all "Warner Bros. related activities." "I don’t want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved," the statement said. The director is currently suing Melanie Kohler for calling him a "rapist" in a Facebook post, according to Variety. Ratner's suit claims that Kohler's comments were made with the sole purpose of damaging his reputation. A model, who has chosen to remain anonymous, has also accused Ratner of masturbating in front of her, in an interview with Page Six. The model said the director flew her to Los Angeles in 2008 for a shoot. While in a car on the way to the shoot's location with Ratner and two of his assistants, she said Ratner began masturbating next to her. “I put my hands over my eyes and said, ‘Stop. That’s disgusting.’ But he wouldn’t stop,” she said. “As he is finishing, his assistant in the front seat hands him tissues.” Ratner’s lawyer Lynda Goldman told Page Six that Ratner, “categorically denies this outrageous story." In a lengthy Facebook post, actress Ellen Page accused Ratner of making homophobic and sexually inappropriate remarks to her and other women while working on " X Men: The Last Stand" together, which Ranter directed. "He looked at a woman standing next to me, ten years my senior, pointed to me and said: 'You should f--k her to make her realize she’s gay,'" Page wrote. "This man, who had cast me in the film, started our months of filming at a work event with this horrific, unchallenged plea," Page continued. "He 'outed' me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognize as homophobic. I proceeded to watch him on set say degrading things to women." Ratner has yet to respond to Page's accusations. Terri Goddard, a former assistant at New Line, alleged that she and several other employees complained to the studio's HR department about the director's inappropriate behavior as early as 2005, in a Variety report. “It’s humiliating to be objectified when you’re trying to do your work,” Goddard said. “People were just appalled.” Goddard said Ratner was known for invading people's boundaries and staring at assistants, but she found that after speaking with HR, Ratner stopped harassing her. Ratner wasn't a New Line employee at the time, but he had directed "Rush Hour," "Money Talks," and "Rush Hour 2" for the studio. Warner Bros. told Variety it has no record of these complaints. In a letter to Variety, Ratner's lawyer Marty Singer said, “I have represented Mr. Ratner for two decades, and no woman has ever made a claim against him for sexual misconduct or sexual harassment.”

Actor Dustin Hoffman Anna Graham Hunter, a writer, accused the Oscar winner Dustin Hoffman of sexually harassing her when she was 17, in a column she wrote for The Hollywood Reporter. Hunter said that while she was interning as a production assistant on the set of "Death of a Salesman" in 1985, Hoffman — who starred in the film — would speak openly about sex in front of her and inappropriately touched her. Hunter said that when she asked for Hoffman's breakfast order one morning, the actor responded, "I'll have a hard-boiled egg … and a soft-boiled clitoris." Hunter said that on one occasion, Hoffman "felt my ass four times" while she walked him to his limousine. Hoffman told The Hollywood Reporter: "I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am." "Genius" producer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis also accused Hoffman of sexual harassment, in an interview with Variety. Riss Gatsiounis met with Hoffman and screenwriter Murray Schisgal twice in 1991 to discuss her new play “A Darker Purpose,” and the possibility of turning it into a movie. According to Riss Gatsiounis, during her second meeting with Hoffman and Schisgal, Hoffman asked her if she had "ever been intimate with a man over 40." Riss Gatsiounis was in her 20s at the time, and Hoffman was 53. Riss Gatsiounis said Hoffman then tried to get her to go to his nearby hotel room with him, and after she declined his offer, he and Schisgal left and said they were no longer interested in her play. In a statement to Variety, Schisgal said he had "no recollection of this meeting or of any of the behavior or actions described.” Dustin Hoffman did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Actor Steven Seagal Actress Portia de Rossi accused action star Steven Seagal of sexually harassing her while she was auditioning for him. "He told me how important it was to have chemistry off-screen as he sat me down and unzipped his leather pants," Rossi wrote on Twitter.



Former "CSI: Miami" actress Eva LaRue also accused Seagal of sexual harassment. LaRue told Deadline that during an audition at the actor's home in 1990, Seagal locked her in a room and proceeded to open his kimono, and then stood in front of her in his underwear. "I go to sit on the couch, and he comes towards me and he’s opening his weirdo kimono," LaRue said. "There’s no script or anything. Just him standing there with his kimono open. He had underwear on, thank God, and he was bare everywhere else. And it was clear he was not just getting cozy.” LaRue left Seagal's home as quickly as possible, and informed her agent about what happened with Seagal, she said.

Jenny McCarthy and Julianna Margulies have also accused Seagal of sexually harassing them during what they thought were auditions. A representative for Seagal denied McCarthy's claim that he harassed her, according to Deadline. Neither Segal nor his representative have yet to respond to the additional allegations against him.

Actor Ed Westwick Actress Kristina Cohen alleged that "Gossip Girl" star Ed Westwick raped her at his Hollywood home in 2014, in a Facebook post. Westwick denied Cohen's claims in a statement on Twitter and Instagram, saying that he didn't know her and has never forced himself on a woman. After making her allegations against Westwick, Cohen filed a police report with the LAPD, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The LAPD is currently investigating Cohen's rape accusation. Actress Aurélie Wynn also alleged that Westwick raped her in July of 2014, while she was at his apartment in a Facebook post. Westwick denied Wynn's claim in a statement on Twitter, saying that he found both of the recent allegations against him "disheartening" and "provably untrue social media claims." Westwick also said that he is "cooperating with the authorities" to clear his name. A third woman has alleged that Westwick sexually assaulted her in February 2014, the same year that both Cohen and Wynn alleged that Westwick raped them. Rachel Eck told Buzzfeed News that she and her ex-boyfriend, producer Kaine Harling, had decided to hang out in a room at the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood. According to Eck, Harling decided to bring Westwick to the room to hang out with them. Throughout the evening Eck said that Westwick would try to kiss her whenever they were alone, and that the actor pushed her against the wall multiple times. Eck informed Harling about Westwick's behavior, and he dismissed her, she said. According to Eck, when she told Harling she was leaving, he told her Westwick wanted to apologize. “Ed then pulled me onto the bed and aggressively groped me,” Eck said. “I shoved him off as quickly as I could and left. I have never felt so uncomfortable in a situation like that in my entire life.” Harling was also present at the hotel during the night Cohen was allegedly raped, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Ed Westwick's attorney did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Comedian and director Louis C.K. Five women have accused comedian and filmmaker Louis C.K. of sexual misconduct, in a report in The New York Times. Chicago-based comedy duo Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov alleged that C.K. masturbated in front of them, after inviting them back to his hotel room in 2002, while attending the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. Comedian Rebecca Corry alleged that while working on a pilot with C.K. in 2005, the comedian asked if he could come to her dressing room and masturbate in front of her. After Corry declined she said C.K.'s "face got red, and he told me he had issues." Comedian, performer, and illustrator Abby Schachner told the Times that she heard C.K. masturbating while he was on the phone with her in 2003. A woman who chose to speak to the Times anonymously said that she worked with C.K. on "The Chris Rock Show" in the 1990s, and that he continuously asked if he could masturbate in front of her, and that eventually she agreed. "It was something that I knew was wrong," she said. "I think the big piece of why I said yes was because of the culture. He abused his power." C.K. released a statement responding to the allegations, confirming that the "stories are true." "At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d--k without asking first, which is also true," C.K. said. "But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d--k isn't a question. It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly." The distribution company for C.K.'s new film "I Love You, Daddy" cancelled the film's release, and HBO, FX, and Netflix have cut ties with C.K. since these accusations have emerged. C.K. has also been dropped by his publicist Lewis Kay and his manager Dave Becky.

Actor George Takei Scott R. Brunton alleged that former "Star Trek" star George Takei sexually assaulted him in 1981, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. Brunton said that after a date with Takei, he went with Takei back to his condo. After having two drinks with him, Brunton said he became dizzy and passed out. He said that he woke with his pants around his ankles, and Takei trying to remove his underwear, while groping him at the same time. Brunton said he told Takei he wasn't interested, and said that Takei told him "to relax." Brunton then said he pushed the actor off of him and went to sit in his car until he was sober enough to drive himself home. Takei denied Brunton's claims in a lengthy post that he shared on both Facebook and Twitter. He wrote that he was "shocked and bewildered" by them. "Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago," Takei said. "But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful." Takei did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for further comment.

Showrunner Mark Schwahn In a joint public statement, showrunner Mark Schwahn was accused of sexual harassment by eighteen women who worked with him on "One Tree Hill." Stars of the series including Sophia Bush, Hilarie Burton, and Bethany Joy Lenz were among the 18 women who signed their names on the statement. The statement said that Schwahn's behavior was an open secret on the show, and that some of the women are still "in treatment" because of his behavior. "Many of us were put in uncomfortable positions and had to swiftly learn to fight back, sometimes physically, because it was made clear to us that the supervisors in the room were not the protectors they were supposed to be," the statement said. "Many of us were spoken to in ways that ran the spectrum from deeply upsetting, to traumatizing, to downright illegal. And a few of us were put in positions where we felt physically unsafe. More than one woman on our show had her career trajectory threatened." Schwahn now works on the popular E! series "The Royals," but was suspended after the allegations broke. Schwahn did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Actor Jeffrey Tambor Jeffrey Tambor's "Transparent" costar Trace Lysette has accused the actor of sexual misconduct. Lysette told The Hollywood Reporter that when she arrived on set to shoot her famous "yas queen" scene for season two of "Transparent" in costume Tambor said, "My God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually." Alexandra Billings, the other actress in the scene, overheard Tambor's remarks and confirmed to THR that Tambor made the comment to Lysette. Lysette then said that a moment later, between takes, Tambor approached her when she was by herself. "He came in close," Lysette said. "Put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrust back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas." Lysette's allegation follows Van Barnes' accusation that Tambor sexually harassed her while she was his assistant on "Transparent." In a statement to Deadline, Tambor called Barnes' accusations "baseless." Lysette told THR that she and Barnes informed the producers of "Transparent" about Tambor's inappropriate behavior towards them and that no action was taken. Tambor said that he is "not a predator" in a statement to THR. "I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone," Tambor said. "But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express." Amazon Studios is currently investigating the allegations of misconduct, according to THR. A spokesperson for Amazon told THR, "This information will be added to our ongoing conversation." Tambor announced in an additional statement to Deadline that he may not be returning to "Transparent" next season. "I’ve already made clear my deep regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being aggressive, but the idea that I would deliberately harass anyone is simply and utterly untrue," Tambor said. "Given the politicized atmosphere that seems to have afflicted our set, I don’t see how I can return to Transparent." Tambor did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Minnesota Senator Al Franken Los Angeles radio news anchor Leeann Tweeden alleged in an article for KABC that Senator Al Franken aggressively kissing her without her consent during a rehearsal for a sketch during a 2006 USO tour. Tweeden also alleged that the senator groped her without her consent while she was asleep, and shared a photograph documenting the incident. In a statement sent to Business Insider, Franken apologized to Tweeden and said he didn't "remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way." "As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it," Franken said. Franken has since released a second, lengthier statement, saying that when he looks at the photo of himself and Tweeden, he feels "disgusted" and that it was "completely inappropriate." Franken has also asked that an ethics committee investigation be undertaken, and has said that he will happily cooperate. "Coming from the world of comedy, I've told and written a lot of jokes that I once thought were funny but later came to realize were just plain offensive," Franken said. "But the intentions behind my actions aren't the point at all. It's the impact these jokes had on others that matters. And I'm sorry it's taken me so long to come to terms with that." Lindsay Menz told CNN that Franken inappropriately touched her while taking a picture in 2010. Menz said that she, her husband, and her father attended the Minnesota State Fair in 2010 when her father's small business was sponsoring a local radio booth at the fair. She spent the day meeting and taking pictures with various celebrities and politicians, who visited the booth. Franken happened to be one of the politicians to visit the booth, and Menz took a picture with him. Menz alleged that while taking a picture with the senator, he "put his hand full-fledged on my rear." "It wasn't around my waist. It wasn't around my hip or side. It was definitely on my butt," Menz recalled. "I was like, oh my God, what's happening." In a statement to CNN, Franken said he didn't remember taking a picture with Menz, and feels bad that she "came away from our interaction feeling disrespected."

Former speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Jeff Hoover Jeff Hoover resigned as speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, after The Courier-Journal reported that the representative reached a sexual harassment settlement with a female member of his staff. According to The Courier-Journal's sources, the woman said she engaged in suggestive texting with Hoover after a fellow staffer told her she needed to indulge him to propel her career. However, the woman said that she later recognized his behavior to be harassment. Shortly after news of Hoover's settlement broke, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin asked that anyone who had secretly settled sexual harassment claims resign from office. While Hoover is no longer the speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, he remains a representative. Hoover did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Former senior vice president in charge of news at NPR, Michael Oreskes Michael Oreskes stepped down from his post at NPR after the company investigated allegations made by two women, who claimed he made unwanted advances toward them when he worked as an editor at the The New York Times nearly 20 years ago. The Washington Post reported the allegations from both women, who claimed Oreskes kissed them without their consent when they met with him to discuss their job prospects. They said that he insinuated that he might hire them as reporters, but neither woman was ever hired by him. Oreskes apologized for his actions in a statement. “I am deeply sorry to the people I hurt. My behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility,” Oreskes said.

New York Times White House correspondent Glenn Thrush The New York Times suspended its star White House correspondent Glenn Thrush Monday, after Vox released a report alleging that Thrush had engaged in inappropriate behavior with female colleagues. “The behavior attributed to Glenn in this Vox story is very concerning and not in keeping with the standards and values of The New York Times,” The Times said in a statement. “We intend to fully investigate and while we do, Glenn will be suspended.” In a statement to Vox, Thrush apologized for his behavior. “Any behavior that makes a woman feel disrespected or uncomfortable is unacceptable,” Thrush said. The Times reports that Thrush is planning on attending a substance abuse program. Thrush joined the Times in January, 2017.-2
http://www.businessinsider.com/rules-of-style-you-should-still-follow-2016-99 classic men's style rules you still have to followSometimes you really should listen to your elders. Though there are some men's style rules that you no longer need to follow, others are ironclad. They were passed down from older generations for a reason, and you'd do your best to follow all of them. We rounded up the nine rules we thought were most important so that you could make sure you're not forgetting anything. The well-styled men of your grandfather's generation would be proud. View As: One Page Slides

Match your shoes and belt when dressing formally. The belt-matching-shoes trope is a little tired, and it's true that its importance is sometimes overstated. But when it comes to formal events, matching the leathers of your belt and shoes is essential to looking well-dressed. There's no way around it: Brown goes with brown and black with black. Otherwise, you'll just look mismatched.

Don't mix patterns. Patterns are great, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing. What has become known as "power clashing" — a style move where one wears more than one pattern in an attempt to look garish on purpose — has no place in modern dress. It's an attempt to stand out and it works in casual settings. But when it's time to dress up, follow the rules and go for an impeccable suit without clashing patterns. It will do so much more for you.

Dress to the specifications required. If an invitation calls for black tie, that's what you must wear. If it says formal, a suit's required. There's no getting away with failing to dress to the dress code. You'll look and feel like a fool if you attempt to circumvent it with "creative dressing." You'll be at a social disadvantage at the event, and everyone will know it. Dress according to what is expected.

Don't wear shorts with a blazer or jacket. Proportion is important to remember when dressing. Your upper and lower halves need to be in balance. That means there should be a similar amount of clothing covering both. You wouldn't (or shouldn't) wear bulky cargo pants with a T-shirt. Similarly, you shouldn't wear a bulky jacket on top without covering your legs.

Match your color palette to the season. White pants and blue shoes are great in the summer when the sun is shining and the flowers are blooming. They make a little less sense when the world is dark and gray, and the sun doesn't come out until almost 9 a.m. You'll look out of place, and feel even more so. Muted colors like navy, olive, and gray can tone your wardrobe down and bring things into the realm of feasibility.

Don't wear a vest on its own. Let's get this straight: Vests are only for three-piece suits. Vests, sans jacket, make you look like a cater waiter, and not in a good way. It makes it look as if your outfit is missing something — namely, a jacket to cover the unsightly shiny rear part of the vest that isn't meant to be seen. This rule is similar to the one that states you shouldn't wear a tie without a blazer, for a similar reason.

Don't button the last button on a jacket or sweater. This is one of the most important rules for any man to know. It's followed all the time, everywhere, and should be observed by everyone. The bottom button looks awkward when buttoned, and it constricts the waist, giving it an odd corset-style look. Leaving it undone does more than just give you a casual, laid-back vibe. It makes you look like you know what you're doing, and that you're cognizant of what you see in the mirror.

Don't wear suspenders and a belt at the same time. Belts hold your pants up; suspenders hold your pants up. Mixing them together is not only redundant but can affect the structural integrity of your pants and make them wear out faster. Stick to a belt, and try to add some personality into your outfit in other ways.0

Strip away a bunch of bells and whistles and you have products that can provide a tremendous amount of value without breaking the bank. These 10 products will keep your devices charged and safe, while also keeping you entertained and free from clutter. If you have $20 or $50 to spend, your options open up dramatically, but you'd be surprised at what you can get for less than $10. View As: One Page Slides

A USB hub If you use a lot of accessories, chances are you'll probably run out of USB ports. This is especially true with notebooks, which have fewer USB ports to begin with. If you don't want to go all out and get a dock for your computer, this 4-port USB hub will probably do the trick. I like this hub because these are USB 3.0 ports, which are significantly faster than older USB 2.0 ports. You'll notice that difference the most if you connect an external hard drive to this hub for backups. Anker Ultra Slim 4-Port USB 3.0 Data Hub, $9.99, available at Amazon

A USB phone charger for your car Because Apple has removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, this multiport car charger is next on my to-buy list. It's great if you want to charge multiple devices at once, but I'm going to use it to keep my phone and Bluetooth audio adapter charged. That way I can listen to music through my car's stereo, and make sure my iPhone has enough juice to get me to my destination. Anker 24W Dual USB Car Charger PowerDrive 2, $9.99, available at Amazon

A multiport USB adapter If you argue with roommates or family members about who gets to charge their phone next, save yourself the aggravation and pick up one of these power adapters. Two people can charge their devices at once, and each USB port supplies 2.4 amps of power, which is great if your device supports fast charging. AUKEY USB Wall Charger, $9.99, available at Amazon

A phone case The world of phone cases is huge. You can get them in any shape or size, but I typically prefer slim, clear cases like this one. They're not the most protective, so if you're accident-prone, it might be better to get something beefier. And if you care about aesthetics at all, this is my current case. That said, a case like this will keep the back of your phone from getting scratched without changing how your phone fits in your hand and pocket. JETech Apple iPhone 7/8 Case Shock-Absorption Bumper COVER, $6.99, available at Amazon

A screen protector I'm just getting into the idea of screen protectors. For a while they were super thin and didn't seem to do much, but I understand their appeal now, especially if you use a slim case. Instead of a film, these screen protectors are made of glass, so they'll be able to withstand a small drop and keep your phone's screen from getting scratched by keys. iPhone 6/6s/7/8 Screen Protector Glass, $7.99, available at Amazon

A laptop sleeve If you'd like some added protection when carrying your laptop around in a backpack or messenger bag, the easiest way to do that is put it in a sleeve. Arvok's option accommodates laptops up to 14-inches in size and is water resistant, which comes in handy if you get caught in the rain. Arvok 13-14 Inch Laptop Sleeve, $8.99, available at Amazon

A phone stand If you keep your phone or tablet sitting on your desk, it's worth investing in a stand. I've gone through periods of using and not using a stand, and in my experience using one has two benefits. The first is I end up using my devices more, because they're right there. That's especially true of a tablet, which I can use for research while typing on my computer (at least that's how I used to do things). The other is that if you keep your devices in one spot, you're more likely to keep a charging cable nearby so you'll always have a full charge. This stand even has a hole you can thread a cable through to encourage that. Lamicall S1 iPhone Stand, $9.99, available at Amazon

A Lightning cable Speaking of cables, it's always good to have a spare or two around just in case. Cables have a tendency to fray, or get left at a friend's house or hotel room. I like this AmazonBasics cable, in particular, because it's made well and is six feet long. I string a cable up between my wall and bed to charge my devices at night and this has worked perfectly in that case. Plus, this cable is MFi-certified, so you know it'll work with all your devices. AmazonBasics Apple Certified Lightning-to-USB Cable, $7.99, available at Amazon

Headphones Don't expect audio miracles in this price range. But for a pair of headphones that cost under $5 people seem to be pretty pleased. They have gummy tips, and three different sizes come in the box so chances are you'll find a set that fit. These are barebones headphones, there's no microphone so you won't be able to play or pause your music without taking out your phone. You also won't be able to take calls. Still, if you're looking for a super cheap pair of earbuds to throw in your pocket without worrying, you could do worse than this pair.

http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-victorias-secret-models-2017-5These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret modelsThe annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will be taking place in Shanghai, China, Monday evening, and broadcast on November 28.

The fashion show is considered one of the most prestigious gigs a model can land. Gaining your "Angel wings" — intricately designed pairs of wings given to the most highly regarded models in the show — is a whole other privilege.

Jan Planit, who used to head up top modeling agency IMG and now runs Planit Model Management, once told the New York Post: "There are very few special things you can achieve as a model. Getting your Angel wings is the ultimate."

The iconic shows are famed for their dramatic, colorful, and skimpy outfits, as well as their impressive lineup of entertainment. This year's musical guests include Harry Styles, Miguel, and Leslie Odom Jr.

Last year, 51 top models made the final cut for the show, just 14 of whom were designated "Victoria's Secret Angels" — brand ambassadors who travel the world promoting Victoria's Secret year-round. Best friends Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner became the most recent models to earn their wings on stage at the 2016 show.

While being in the show or getting wings are honors in themselves, the money doesn't hurt either. Nine of the models who appeared in the 2016 show appeared on Forbes' list of the world’s 20 highest-paid models in 2016.

Scroll down to see the highest-paid Victoria's Secret models from last year's show, ranking in ascending order by their 2016 earnings, according to Forbes.

http://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-commutes-in-photos-2017-11This photographer captured shots of New Yorkers on their way to work for 10 years — and it shows how repetitive a commute can beThe photographer Peter Funch photographed the same Manhattan corner during the morning rush hour for 10 years.

Intrigued by the idea of repetition, he captured photos of the same people on their way to work.

His new book, "42nd and Vanderbilt," is a collection of his work from the series.



About 700,000 people pass through Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal on their way to work every day.

In 2007, the photographer Peter Funch began staking out a corner of the station, at 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, to document those commuters. Funch would snap photos from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., and he would often photograph the same subject twice — sometimes days apart, other times years.

Fascinated by these small moments of human behavior, Funch created a series that explores the seemingly mundane. His unknowing subjects are captured smoking, listening and singing along to music, watching people, and making eye contact with other commuters.

"All these moments are telling small stories about us," he told Business Insider.

His new book, "42nd and Vanderbilt," places his subjects side by side. The two photos, taken at different moments, show the similarities in the day-to-day and explore the idea of repetition and ritual. Funch said the photos captured "that trance we are in when going from A to B."0

http://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funder-barry-rosenstein-hamptons-mansion-photos-2017-11A hedge fund manager just put his $70 million Hamptons beach house on the market — take a look insideHedge-fund manager Barry Rosenstein put his Hamptons beach house on the market for $70 million.

The property covers 13,623 square feet and has seven bedrooms, 9.5 bathrooms, a guest cottage, and a lap pool.

Rosenstein broke the record for the most expensive home ever sold in the United States when he paid $137 million for another Hamptons property in 2014. Three years after buying the most expensive home in US history, hedge-fund manager Barry Rosenstein is putting another of his homes on the market for $70 million. Located in the Hamptons, the home was purchased by Rosenstein for $19.2 million in 2005, according to the Wall Street Journal. Rosenstein founded the hedge fund Jana Partners in 2001. The fund has invested in Whole Foods and Blue Apron, among other companies. In 2013, he paid $137 million for a home in East Hampton — a purchase that remains a record in the United States. While it won't break any real estate records, Rosenstein's $70 million property is still quite luxurious. Take a look at what it has to offer. View As: One Page Slides

If the home sells for its listed price, Rosenstein stands to make a profit of more than $50 million. He bought it for $19.2 million in 2005.

It has a total of seven bedrooms and 9.5 bathrooms.

The property originally held a small cottage that was built in the 1920s, but Rosenstein had architect Rick Cook design a much larger beach home after he bought the property.

According to Cook, Rosenstein "wanted a high-performance, sustainable home that still incorporated the tradition and comfort of an old shingle style property." Source: The Wall Street Journal

The home also gives its owner private access to the Atlantic Ocean.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/eco-friendly-flat-pack-tiny-home-takes-six-hours-to-build-2017-11An Italian architect has designed an eco-friendly flat-pack home that costs £25,000 and only takes 6 hours to buildInstagram/domenico__antonucci M.A.DI flatpack homes offer a new solution to the global property crisis.

M.A.DI homes is selling flat-pack homes from just £25,000.

The tiny homes can be assembled in six to seven hours.

Each comes complete with kitchen and bathroom facilities, a staircase leading to a mezzanine living area, central heating, and air conditioning.

Italian architect Renato Vidal has designed a new affordable living concept – flat-pack homes which start from just £25,000 ($US33,000).

Called M.A.DI homes, the concept could work just as easily as a bachelor pad as it could a permanent family home.

Vidal’s modular houses are earthquake resistant and come complete with kitchen and bathroom facilities, a staircase and mezzanine living area, central heating, and air conditioning – and they apparently only take six or seven hours to assemble with three workers.

The tiny homes come in varying sizes, with prices beginning at €28,000 (£25,000 or $US33,000) for the smallest 27 square metre (290 sq ft) single unit, rising to €62,000 (£55,000 or $US73,000) for the 84 square metre (904 sq ft) triple family home.

A post shared by Domenico Antonucci (@domenico__antonucci) on Dec 10, 2016 at 7:49am PST

Designs will be drawn up within 10 days of the agreement of the sale, and delivery will be made 60 days from these drawings being accepted.

They’re flexible too, according to the brochures – if you decide to move location you can simply pack up your unit and take it with you.

Equally, if you’re in need of some more space, you can simply buy more modules to add to your house.

Each additional module costs €16,000 (£14,000 or $US19,000) while an extra staircase will set you back €2,000 (£1,800 or $US2,400).

The tiny homes, which are manufactured by Italian wood specialist Area Legno, are also eco-friendly.

Here’s a video of the assembly, which takes just six hours.

http://www.businessinsider.com/leonardo-da-vinci-painting-salvator-mundi-instagram-controversy-price-conservation-2017-11There's even more controversy surrounding the $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting — and it's getting nastyLeonardo da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi" became the most expensive painting ever after it sold for $450 million at auction.

The former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas Campbell, is fighting on Instagram with Robert Simon, a previous co-owner of the painting, over its sale.

It's reflective of how much marketing and social media has come to dominate the art world.

There are also legitimate concerns over how to conserve the painting, which is hard to do without a museum.

Even before "Salvator Mundi" — a "lost" painting by Leonardo da Vinci — sold November 16 for a record-shattering $450 million at Christie's, it was already mired in controversy as some critics, including New York Magazine's Jerry Saltz, questioned its authenticity.

Now another storm is brewing around the work, a portrait of Christ that was "rediscovered" in 2005 and authenticated as real several years later.

Thomas Campbell, the embattled former director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art — the biggest art museum in the Western Hemisphere — and one of the painting's previous co-owners, art dealer Robert Simon, are arguing about the painting on Instagram.

"450 million dollars?! Hope the buyer understands conservation issues," Campbell wrote in an Instagram post shortly after the painting sold.

450 million dollars?! Hope the buyer understands conservation issues... @christiesinc #leonardodavinci #salvatormundi #readthesmallprint A post shared by Tom Campbell (@thomaspcampbell) on Nov 15, 2017 at 5:52pm PST on Nov 15, 2017 at 5:52pm PST

Robert Simon, one of the painting's previous owners, commented on Campbell's post that he found the post "disrespectful."

"This is an incredibly ill-informed and mean-spirited comment about one of the most respected painting conservators in the world, one who incidentally spent many years diligently working at your former institution," Simon wrote.

Some art world observers find the spat less about conservation and more about the enormous sum of money spent the painting, which was sold by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev and sold to an anonymous buyer. The work went for more than twice the price of the next-most expensive painting sold at public auction. It was also the first time a third-party marketing agency was used to promote a sale.

"The art world is all about social media presence and marketing now," an employee at a major New York gallery told INSIDER. "So for the Met director to throw shade on Instagram seems pretty on par with how the art world is going."

There is a legitimate concern over how the painting will be preserved.

The conservation of "Salvator Mundi" is a major concern in the art world. Conserving paintings is expensive, especially when they're 500 years old and in delicate condition.

Often, art owners will put work on "permanent loan" to a museum in exchange for the museum covering the cost of the work's upkeep.

But the identity of the painting's new owner has not been unmasked yet, and it's not clear how the work will be conserved or displayed.

The conservation of the painting under Simon's co-ownership (along with art dealers Alex Parish and Warren Adelson) was in the hands of Dianne Modestini, a conservationist and researcher at New York University.

The painting was in poor condition when it was discovered in 2005, and went through an extensive restoration by Modestini. Christie's ended up categorizing it as "Post-War and Contemporary Art."

In his comment, Simon defended Modestini's work.

"I personally observed the conservation process on the Salvator Mundi and can attest to the absolute honesty, modesty, and respect that Dianne Modestini brought to her work on the painting—carried out at the highest ethical standards of the profession," Simon wrote. "Given the prevalence of so many foolish remarks in both serious and social media, I have refrained from responding, but feel compelled to do so now."

In the same thread, Campbell dismissed Simon's concerns.

"I have [the] greatest respect for Modestini," Campbell wrote. "Was simply remarking, as so many others have, on extensive amount of conservation. Seems to be a lot of over-sensitivity out there."

Loic Gouzer, an executive at Christie's, also joined the fray. While there's no public post from him on the Instagram thread (The Art Newspaper surmises it may have been in a direct message), Campbell wrote a response to Gouzer criticizing his "abusive bullying."

"My comment was a legitimate response to an extraordinary price," Campbell wrote. "Christie’s doesn’t need your abusive bullying to defend itself. And my comment certainly wasn’t an attack on a highly competent conservator. If you don’t enjoy my occasional Instagram posts then don’t follow me."

Even in the upper echelons of the art world, no one is immune to Instagram spats.

Gouzer, Campbell, and Simon didn't immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment.

http://www.businessinsider.com/fast-food-cup-optical-illusion-2017-11The internet is flummoxed by this optical illusion of the same amount of soda filling up 3 different-sized fast food cupsA video circulating on Twitter shows what appears to be the same amount of liquid filling three different-sized cups from the fast food chain Jack in the Box.

Twitter users were quick to debunk the optical illusion.

Another video posted on Twitter shows a more accurate depiction of pouring liquid into small, medium, and large Jack in the Box cups.

The internet doesn't know what to think of an optical illusion recently posted on Twitter, in which a person fills three different-sized fast food cups with what appears to be the same amount of soda.

The video begins with what looks like a small-sized cup filled with soda. The person filming pours the full cup into a medium-size cup and the liquid fills it to the top. Finally, they pour the full medium cup into a large-size cup, filling it nearly to the brim as well.

According to Jack in the Box's menu, drinks come in four sizes — 16, 20, 30, and 40 ounces. It's unclear which size cups were used in the video, but we can assume that the small cup used is 16 ounces and the medium cup is 20 ounces.

Check out the video for yourself here:

Other Twitter users were quick to call out possible tricks behind the optical illusion, alleging that the medium and large-sized cups already had liquid in them before the contents of the small cup were poured. Since the cups are not shown from above, they could have already been partially full when the liquid from the small cup was poured.

Last cup already had liquid in it — Honorary Nudist 💫 (@ReallyRudeDude) November 19, 2017

And while anyone who watched the video was effectively stumped, at least momentarily, it seems that the case has been closed on this optical illusion.

Another Twitter user posted a similar video of someone pouring a small cup of water into a medium then a large cup. Since the liquid is clear, it's harder to see the difference in volume between the three cups, although ultimately viewers can see that the final large-sized cup is not full.

The rolling-eyes emoji says it all.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/01/three-tips-to-make-learning-a-second-language-easier_a_23264042/Three Tips To Make Learning A Second Language EasierLearning a second language is no easy task.

A lot of time and dedication is required, plus there is a significant amount of memorising of words and phrases. And even once you've learnt those, it takes both skill and confidence to use them in a real-life setting.

Well, Associate Professor Evan Kidd from the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language says that anyone can learn a new language as long as they put enough time into the process.

"I think that almost anyone, if they give it a good enough shot, is going to have some abilities in a language with enough exposure and time," Kidd told HuffPost Australia.

According to Kidd, one of the biggest challenges adults face when learning a new language is approaching it with the knowledge of their mother tongue. Our brains are finely tuned to our first language and so we approach any new linguistic situation within the framework of that first language.

"The challenge in learning a second language is the fact that you have a first language," Kidd said. "Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language."

So, what are some ways that we can make the language-learning process easier?

Three ways to make learning a new language easier Use stock phrases Learning a few generic and adaptable phrases in a new language can make it easier to use and also give you a template to build other terms using that same formula. "It's good to have a few stock phrases because then you can start strapping off from those so you can say -- 'OK I have got this phrase and I can put different verbs in it and different nouns in it', which is actually how young kids tend to learn," Kidd said. Memorise When you first start out, learning the basic grammar and vocabulary of any language is going to require time to create a solid linguistic foundation. This means a lot of dedication to learning the words and making an effort to remember those through practice. "Inevitably, there are going to be instances where you are just going to need to memorise the rule because, let's face it, languages are weird entities." Actually speak the language Kidd said that in his experience, one of the most important things when learning a new language is making the effort to use it as much as possible. "It's all fine and good to sit there and learn it and then do in a class, but you really have to talk and I think by virtue of talking that's when you really start to get much more sense that this is a communicative system and you really want to use that to communicate." "[It's a] combination between memorisation and a little bit of 'extraversion' and having a go."

Children are exposed to languages at a very young age, even from the time they are in the womb. The process of acquiring language begins with sounds and language rhythms and eventually builds up to words and sentences.

"One of the cool things about infants when they are born is they have the ability to perceive the difference between any sound that the human vocal tract can make, and the thing is that any one language will only use a subset of those sounds," Kidd said.

An interesting example of how this works can be found when the English and Japanese languages are compared.

"In English we have a distinction between the 'R' sound and the 'L' sound but in Japanese they don't have that distinction -- they've got one which is between these two sounds," Kidd explained.

"So, what happens when a Japanese infant is born is that they can distinguish between the 'R' and 'L' sounds but once they get to about 12 months they can't do it anymore and that is because their language doesn't have it."

Children under 12 months can identify every sound a human voice tract can make.

As humans lose this ability around the age of 12 months, we become unable to accurately distinguish some sounds that our mother tongue doesn't use. It's in this way that learning a first and a second language is fundamentally different.

Most of us can't remember learning our first language because it was effortless and occurred over a long period of time, but acquiring that second one requires a lot of hard work.

"I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit."

The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well. Kidd says that being as confident as possible with another language could be the gateway to your success.

"Let's face it, there is nothing more humbling than learning a second language and using it because you just revert to [being] a two-year-old."0
https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/holiday-shopping-surprises-favorite-stores-amazon/Retailers look to woo shoppers from rivals as Amazon growsRetailers look to woo shoppers from rivals as Amazon grows

Retailers are kicking off the holiday shopping season with an eye toward wooing shoppers away from rivals. | AP file photo

NEW YORK — Toys and TVs at J.C. Penney, Barbies at Best Buy, kitchen appliances like wine refrigerators at B.J.’s. As the holiday shopping season officially kicks off Thursday, shoppers may find some surprises at their favorite stores.

Even as retailers are counting on a lift from a better economy, they’re looking beyond economic data and mapping out ways to pick up sales from other retailers as Amazon expands its reach. That can mean opening earlier than rivals on the holidays or even jumping into new product categories. The fight for market share comes as analysts at Bain say Amazon is expected to take half of the holiday season’s sales growth. And Amazon is the top destination for people to begin holiday shopping, according to a September study by market research firm NPD Group.

“The retailers are in survival mode. It’s about stealing each other’s market share,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD. “Amazon is the Grinch. They’re stealing the growth.”

With the jobless rate at a 17-year-low of 4.1 percent and consumer confidence stronger than a year ago, analysts project healthy sales increases for November and December.

The National Retail Federation trade group expects sales for that period to at least match last year’s rise of 3.6 percent and estimates online spending and other non-store sales will rise 11 percent to 15 percent.

Amazon is expected to be a big beneficiary as it cements loyalty among its Prime members and moves into new services and private-label merchandise. The company has introduced more than 20 such brands in the past two years in clothing, electronics, groceries and more, says Bain.

That leaves stores looking at rivals to see where they can pick up sales. There are extra dollars up for grabs this year, after thousands of store locations have closed and several retailers including Gymboree and Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy protection.

Jordan Ascencio, who has sons aged 1, 7, and 8, plans to bypass Toys R Us on Black Friday after being turned off by what she says are dirty stores and skimpy supplies. The latest problem: Her online order was canceled following a large-scale coupon glitch.

“I am not a fan anymore,” said the resident of Sapulpa, Oklahoma. Instead, she plans to buy toys at J.C. Penney and Target.

And with Gymboree shuttering a quarter of its stores, Ascencio is buying more of her children’s clothing at Target, which has launched a number of new private label brands.

Target CEO Brian Cornell recently highlighted that up to $60 billion in consumer spending will be up for the taking in the next few years, and said the chain has been picking up market share in such areas as clothing.

The Thanksgiving weekend, when stores go all-out to attract shoppers, can be an indication of how well they’ll do through the season. About 69 percent of Americans, or 164 million people, intend to shop at some point during the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, according to a survey released by the National Retail Federation. It expects Black Friday to remain the busiest day, with about 115 million people planning to shop then.

Stores like Macy’s, Target and Kohl’s are set to open Thursday evening as they try to woo early shoppers. Walmart starts deals in its stores at 6 p.m. J.C. Penney is opening its doors at 2 p.m., an hour earlier than last year and at least three hours ahead of its department store rivals.

Some retailers are using the weekend to test new product areas before committing to them year-round: Penney says it will have TVs and consumer electronics like game consoles as doorbusters for Thanksgiving and Black Friday only. Penney has also added year-round toy shops and increased its selection of work pants as an apparent move to grab market share from Sears, after last year going back to selling major appliances.

Penney’s Senior Vice President James Starke called these moves “market share plays.”

Both Walmart and Target have been expanding their exclusive toys offerings. Walmart is throwing parties in its stores including ones where kids can play with new toys. Best Buy created its first toy booklet for the holidays. And in its Black Friday ad, the chain features Barbies among smart TVs and other electronics.

Chris Baldwin, CEO of BJ’s Wholesale Club, says it is offering more toys and clothes. In clothing, it’s offering key national brands in areas like casual athletic wear amid rampant store closures. And he says clothing sales are up by at least 10 percent as people don’t go to the mall as much.

“There’s no question that consumer spending has started to tick up and confidence is a little bit better, which is terrific, but we are also seeing some benefit from other retailers,” he said.0

How many pounds is this?

Waitress: Four pounds.



Will Wei: Ok. I'm going to go with the Octuple Bypass Burger. So, I can add 40 bacon slices to it.

Waitress: Do you want bacon, chili, tomato, onion, lettuce cheese on it?

Will Wei: Yeah, you know what? Let's get everything. And the Flat Liner fries and the wine with the IV bag and pole.

Waitress: Do you want merlot or chardonnay?

Wei: I don't know. Does it really matter at this point?

Waitress: Not really. Alright are you ready for some surgery? I'm really excited to spank you.

Wei: Oh, and if you don't finish your food, you'll get a spanking from your waitress. It's company policy, apparently.



Waitress: Ok, you ready? This is the merlot.



Wei: What year? Do you know?

Waitress: Hahaha, no.

Wei: Alright, here's the wine.

Waitress bring out the burger.

There it is.

Waitress: It comes with 8 patties. Four pounds of beef. There's 40 pieces of bacon on there; chili, tomato, and cheese. So, good luck to you!



Wei: The Octuple Bypass Burger. Oh my god. Can you actually pick this up? Here I go. I don't know where to start. Here we go. How many calories is this, do you know?

Waitress 2: Nineteen thousand, nine hundreds, and something. It's enough for about 10 days.

Wei: Alright, I feel good about myself. I have people literally staring at me through the window wondering what the hell is that guy eating.

I've eaten a lot of weird things in my life. I've eaten the McGang Bang, the Monster Mac, the Land, Sea, and Air burger. But none of that compares to this. This burger has enough calories to last a normal human being for 10 days. There's no way I'm going to finish this, and I really don't want a spanking so what I'm going to do is take some cash out of my wallet, put it down here, and I'm going to sneak out of here.

http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bizarrely-responds-article-criticising-racism-towards-lavar-ball-blacks-2017-11Trump bizarrely responds to article suggesting he criticizes black people for racist reasonsP resident Donald Trump bizarrely responded to a tweet suggesting he speaks ill of prominent black people to capitalize on racism among his base.

Trump responded by tweeting "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."

Moments later, Trump tweeted the same thing but not in response, so perhaps his response to the provocative article was an error.





President Donald Trump offered a bizarre but familiar response to an article on the Washington Post's liberal-leaning "Plum Line" blog that suggested he criticized prominent black people to play on a racist sentiment among his base.

Responding to Greg Sargent's tweet that said "Trump regularly attacks high-profile African Americans to feed his supporters' belief that the system is rigged for minorities," Trump replied: "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."

The exchange on Thanksgiving morning came after Trump attacked LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo Ball, one of the UCLA freshmen released from being detained in China after Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Twitter.

Trump called Ball an "ungrateful fool" and compared him to a "poor man's version of Don King," after Ball refused to thank Trump for his role in getting his son and the other players freed from China, where they had admitted to shoplifting from several stores.

The article by Sargent linked this to other attacks Trump has made on well-known black people in sports and politics, calling it a "gratuitously ugly pattern."

Sargent's article ends by suggesting Trump engages in a "pattern of race-baiting" that "might be designed to resonate with" his supporters.

Trump has, throughout his career, attacked dozens of politicians, media personalities, and sports stars of all races, but his response was bizarre because moments later he tweeted the exact same thing but not in response to the article.

Trump has erroneously tweeted things many times before. In late October, he wished a happy birthday to Lee Greenwood, the singer who wrote "God Bless the USA," but tagged the wrong Lee Greenwood on Twitter, instead tagging someone who had appeared to protest Trump's immigration ban.-1
https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tor-silk-road-deep-web-2013-3There's a secret internet for drug dealers, assassins, and pedophilesPhoto: Screenshot

The average person is only aware of a fraction of the Internet.There is more content out there than any conventional browser can access. These sites are termed “Deep Web” or “Undernet.” They exist outside the scope of Google, Facebook, and your RSS reader. It’s the digital equivalent of a thriving city that’s been domed over and cordoned off.



Click here to jump straight to our tour of the Deep Web >

These sites are locked down so tightly that you need a special browser to access them. It’s called the Tor browser, and it offers you an entirely new way of connecting to the Internet.

Where conventional web browsers like Chrome and Firefox make no effort to conceal your location or identity, Tor is built upon the idea of preserving anonymity as aggressively as possible.

What is Tor?

Tor, originally an acronym for “The Onion Router,” is an anonymity network designed to keep your identity and location completely secure as you browse the web. When you use the Tor browser (a free download), volunteer servers around the world route your internet traffic from server to server before finally delivering you your content. On top of this evasive routing, data is encrypted a number of times as it travels to you.

Exploring the Deep Web

Michael Bergman of BrightPlanet puts it succinctly: “Searching on the Internet today can be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean. While a great deal may be caught in the net, there is still a wealth of information that is deep, and therefore, missed.”

Using the Tor browser unlocks the door to a whole weird and wild world you never would have guessed existed online. Where Google helps you find the needle, Tor lets you “explore the haystack.”

There is lots of promise in Tor’s value – people use it to protect their communications, to research sensitive topics, and to access information they might otherwise not have access to (if a country is behind a firewall, for example). By guaranteeing such a high level of anonymity, Tor lends itself well to information freedom activists, libertarians, and those who simply want to take their Internet safety to the extreme.

But with such anonymizing power made available for free, some less-than-legal (and even downright malicious) operations claim to operate successfully.

The Dark Side of the Deep Web

There are several websites claiming to offer some crazy goods and services through Tor:

Silk Road is dubbed the “Amazon.com of drugs.” Gawker published a story on the site. Through Bitcoin, a secure and anonymous digital currency that can be exchanged for real money, vendors are able to set up shop digitally and sell their wares through the U.S. Postal Service. (It’s important to note that Bitcoins are cash equivalents, so if someone rips you off you have no recourse.)

EuroArms sells and delivers weapons (without ammunition).

You can hire assassins through a service called “White Wolves.”

Child pornography is readily available through countless sites.

The Human Experiment details medical experiments performed on people against their will.

Click here to jump straight to our tour of the Deep Web >

Should we shut it down?

It depends on how you look at it. Just because the Deep Web is a place where the id tends to run wild doesn’t mean others aren’t finding legitimate and creative uses for it:

Young & Sick is a Los Angeles-based fashion, art, and music project that released its newest single, “Continuum,” via Tor earlier this week.

Originally developed for use by the Navy, Tor has plenty of military applications in how it protects communications and intelligence gathering.

WikiLeaks provides users with means to upload documents anonymously.

Despite being around since 2004, Tor’s ability to keep our online identities secret seems to only just recently be coming to public light.

https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/11/30-years-later-the-max-headroom-tv-hackers-remain-at-large30 Years Later, The Max Headroom TV Hackers Remain At LargeFor 25 seconds in 1987, in the middle of WGN-TV anchor Dan Roan's sportscast, thousands of Chicagoans' feeds were replaced with a low analogue whine and the eery image of a masked man nodding over and over as if in a state of mania. "If you're wondering what's happened, so am I," Roan said to his audience once WGN regained control of the signal. What he couldn't have known is that the rest of the world would still be wondering to this day.

9:14PM CST on November 22 (2:14PM AEDT on November 23) marks 30 years since one of the most unusual hacks in history: The Max Headroom signal intrusion. One of them wearing a mask of fictional AI TV host and New Coke spokesthing Max Headroom, the pranksters hijacked two stations that November evening - first WGN-TV, and two hours later an even more memorable takeover of WTTW during a broadcast of Doctor Who.

What made the second incident stand out? Besides seizing WTTW's airwaves for nearly three times as long as WGN-TV's, the hackers successfully broadcasted audio, and it was creepy enough to match the unnerving visuals.

The heavily distorted signal, repeated moans, and nauseous swaying of the background give the impression that the character is in pain, agonisingly trapped inside the rogue signal. If the effect was to craft something impenetrable and frightening, they mostly succeeded.

Undercutting the terror of a low-bitrate man with a giant head appearing in the TV unannounced are the words themselves, at least the ones that are audible. They're standard hacker snark: "Catch the wave," a snarling reference to New Coke; "Yeah, I think I'm better than [WGN sportscaster] Chuck Swirsky"; and another obtuse dig at WGN prescient, "I just made a giant masterpiece for all the greatest world newspaper nerds." (WGN stands for World's Greatest Newspaper.)

"They're coming to get me," he groans before turning around to have an accomplice spank his bare arse for about eight seconds. Then Doctor Who came back on.

At the time, WGN Engineering Directs Robert Strutzel said that such a signal intrusion "takes very sophisticated equipment to do this at a significant power level", which should have made the hackers as simple to find as HBO's "captain midnight" a few months prior. But FCC and FBI involvement at the time proved fruitless, and civilian theories have had as much success in the intervening years at determining the identity or the motive of the hackers. In that sense, those two minute of inscrutable footage remain a perfect crime.0

http://www.businessinsider.com/too-many-people-break-the-cardinal-rule-of-the-office-holiday-party-2017-11Too many people break the cardinal rule of the office holiday partyNo matter how festive the occasion, the holiday office party is still about business.

Drink in moderation to avoid embarrassing yourself in front of your boss.

Dress appropriately because it is still an office setting, and you've worked hard to create a professional image.

Make sure to check if significant others are allowed to attend office parties before you bring one.

Your company's holiday gathering is just around the corner—time to let loose and party with your co-workers after a long year, right? Wrong.

According to business etiquette expert Hilka Klinkenberg, the cardinal rule is to remember that no matter how festive the occasion, it's still about business. Don't fall off the fast track to success or risk damaging your professional reputation in one night of inadvertent blunders. Klinkenberg offers the following advice to ensure a smooth, enjoyable evening.

Eat, drink and be merry — in moderation

Where else but the office party can you find the CEO and the mailroom clerk bellied up to the bar together? But remember: Alcohol plus you and your boss can equal Monday morning's "I can't believe I said that." If you choose to drink, do so minimally.

Dress appropriately for the occasion

Klinkenberg says this rule especially applies to women who sometimes use company parties to strut their stuff. Leave anything short, tight or revealing in the closet. You've worked hard to create a professional image, and revealing clothes can alter your coworkers' and manager's perception of you as a competent professional.

Introduce yourself

Your company party may be the only time you see the president, CEO or VPs in person. This is a great opportunity to become visible to your organization's higher-ups. At the very least, don't spend the entire evening with your regular office buddies—get in the holiday spirit and mingle with people from other departments.

Find out who can come to the event

Spouses and significant others are not always on the guest list. Check beforehand to avoid a potentially uncomfortable evening.

Practice humility

If you've been a star performer in your organization, you may be honored with a toast. Accept the honor gracefully, but don't drink to yourself or clap when others are applauding you. Also, make a toast to the person who toasted you, thanking him for the recognition.

Pay attention to the time you arrive and when you leave

Even if you don't really want to attend, avoid arriving 20 minutes before the end just to make an appearance. On the flip side, don't party into the wee hours either. Coworkers and managers will notice both errors in judgment.

Be sure to thank those who coordinated the party

They likely put in a great deal of effort hoping you would have a good time. Not only is saying thank you the nice thing to do, but it also makes you stand out from the many employees who don't.

If you're in charge of planning the party, a few reminders:0

2. North Korea said the US's decision to relist it as a state sponsor of terrorism is a "serious provocation". The designation allowed the US to impose greater sanctions.

3. UK's Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a new budget. Announcements included a railcard for millennials and the abolition of stamp duty for most first-time homebuyers.

4. Governments around the world are launching investigations into Uber. The investigations are looking into the company's cover up of a data breach affecting 57 million users.

5. Tesla has completed construction of the world's largest lithium ion battery. Elon Musk made a bet that he could build the 100-megawatt project in Australia in 100 days, or it was free.

6. Saad al Hariri un-resigned as President of Lebanon. Hariri resigned earlier this month, putting Lebanon at the forefront of the regional tussle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

7. Facebook will allow users to see if they've interacted with Russian-linked accounts. Roughly 150 million Facebook users saw posts linked to the Russian propaganda organization Internet Research Agency.

8. Papa New Guinea police stormed a former Australian detention center housing asylum seekers and refugees. Australian officials left three weeks ago, but more than 400 men remain and are scared for their safety.

9. Palestinian rival factions Hamas and Fatah agreed to hold general elections by 2018. Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal in October after Hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of Gaza to Fatah.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/fcc-releases-final-net-neutrality-proposal-2017-11The US government proposed new rules that would let internet providers block apps and create fast lanes -- read the full planChip Somodevilla/Getty Images Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.

The Federal Communications Commission will vote December 14 on a new rule that would roll back net-neutrality regulations adopted in 2015.

The FCC released the full text of the order on Wednesday.

It proposes allowing internet service providers to create so-called fast lanes and block apps and services, as well as giving privacy oversight to the Federal Trade Commission.

The Federal Communications Commission, led by chairman Ajit Pai, on Wednesday released the final draft of a closely watched plan to reverse a net-neutrality policy barring internet service providers from blocking or slowing down web content.

Net neutrality is the concept that all internet traffic should be treated equally, no matter what ISP is carrying it.

Pai’s proposal, named the Restoring Internet Freedom order, would reverse a 2015 ruling that classifies ISPs as utilities – opposed by ISPs and supported by net-neutrality advocates, who say such policies encourage innovation.

The main difference from the current policy in Pai’s proposed order is that broadband internet access would be classified under Title I of the Communications Act instead of under Title II – basically, ISPs would be “information services” instead of “public utilities.”

This seemingly small change would allow ISPs like Comcast and Verizon to legally experiment with so-called fast lanes for internet traffic, in which they prioritise some apps and services over others. Theoretically, under these rules, an ISP could prioritise its own traffic or even block certain apps or services.

The order would also give significant additional authority to the Federal Trade Commission:

“Our balanced approach also restores the authority of the nation’s most experienced cop on the privacy beat – the Federal Trade Commission – to police the privacy practices of Internet Service Providers.”

Some FCC commissioners have said they will oppose the order.

This is the @FCC plan to roll back #NetNeutrality: https://t.co/05owAva2hu. Don't boo. Read it. Then roar. It's time to make a ruckus. It's time to #SaveNetNeutrality. — Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) November 22, 2017

The FCC will vote on the order at its meeting on December 14.

Looking to pick up some new skills in 2014 but not sure what to focus on?

LinkedIn has you covered. The online career site recently released a list of the 25 hottest skills that got people hired in the past year. Not surprisingly, the list is overwhelmingly composed of tech, coding, and data analysis skills, with “social media marketing” taking the No. 1 spot.

The site came up with its list by grouping the thousands of skills people list on their LinkedIn profiles into general categories (i.e., “press releases” into “public relations”). From there, it analysed which skills drew the most interest from employers based on hiring activity (members who changed jobs in 2013) and recruiting activity (searches put out by recruiters).

The results offer even more evidence that we live in a data-driven world. LinkedIn also notes that businesses seem to be growing and expanding, since skills like “recruiting” and “business development” land among the top 10.

So if you’re aiming to beef up your skill set in 2014, here’s a good place to start. We’re willing to bet they’re not going out of style any time soon.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42092438Little Miss Inventor joins Mr Men and Little Miss line-upImage copyright Thoip Image caption Little Miss Inventor will be published in March

A new character is joining the Mr Men and Little Miss series - a female engineer.

Little Miss Inventor has been created as a "positive role model" for girls, its author and illustrator Adam Hargreaves said.

She will be the 36th Little Miss character and joins the likes of Little Miss Sunshine and Little Miss Magic.

The character, with pencils and a spanner in her hair, is described as "intelligent, ingenious and inventive".

'Challenging stereotypes'

The book blurb says "her brain is full of ideas, which she turns into extraordinary inventions in a shed at the bottom of her garden".

Those inventions include a backpack-snack-attack fridge for Mr Greedy and a chatter-natter hat for Little Miss Chatterbox - but she's stumped when asked to invent something for Mr Rude.

The book telling her story will be released on 8 March 2018 - tying in with International Women's Day and British Science Week.

Hargreaves, son of Mr Men and Little Miss creator Roger Hargreaves, said: "I always enjoy creating a brand new character for the series and it was fun coming up with lots of crazy inventions for Little Miss Inventor's home and silly ones for all her friends.

"It's also been nice to write a story that promotes a positive role model and to challenge a stereotype, if only in a small way."

Image copyright Adam Hargreaves Image caption Hargreaves took over the Mr Men and Little Miss books from his father

Fans on Twitter were quick to applaud the new character - with coder Annie Parker writing: "Never have I wanted a book more!"

And the Geek Girl Riot radio show tweeted: "Little Miss Inventor is not the heroine we deserved, but the heroine we needed."

Tom Tivnan, features and insight editor at The Bookseller, said the Mr Men and Little Miss books had been "reinventing themselves for almost 30 years".

He said the series had been "helped by canny updating with more modern characters", like last year's Mr and Little Miss Fabulous.

"Ultimately it's a brand that stays true to its values with feet firmly planted in its nostalgic past," he told the BBC.

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/RFID-Sensors-2018-2028-Forecasts-Players-Opportunities-Annual-Market-Value-will-Reach-904-Million-1009268939RFID Sensors 2018-2028: Forecasts, Players, Opportunities - Annual Market Value will Reach $904 MillionDUBLIN, November 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

The "RFID Sensors 2018-2028: Forecasts, Players, Opportunities" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.

The general RFID market has seen substantial growth over the last few years, with successful public offerings and rapid growth in terms of the number of RFID tags sold. Vendors are now exploring allied technologies with RFID sensors at the forefront of this. This has been enabled thanks to new chipsets, at both HF(NFC) and UHF (RAIN) which are dedicated to support sensor platforms and therefore make RFID sensors simpler to make and lower cost in addition to the increasing maturity and wider scale adoption of RFID reader infrastructure. Additionally, new technologies from printed sensors and flexible batteries to bio sensing films meet unmet needs and provide differentiation.

Different technologies approach different market segments

Several different technology categories exist, namely:

1. Passive RFID sensors with no on board power source

2. Passive RFID tags with bio sensors, with no board power source

3. Battery assisted passive RFID sensors

4. "Chipless" RFID sensors - without a conventional silicon chip

From the above options, most can be bought to operate at either HF or UHF RFID, with HF RFID options offering a wider reader network thanks to NFC enabled consumer electronic devices albeit with limited read range of UHF devices with longer read range but requiring more expensive reader systems. The RF protocols developed for RFID are effectively being used as a means of data transfer of sensory information.

RFID Sensors 2018-2028 is the first report that covers all these options, the players behind the ICs, sensor tags and systems, the applications, trends and market size, forecast over a ten year period. The report draws comparisons form and assesses the related data logger market, and explores the role for RFID Sensors within that. SWOT (Strength, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) reports are given for the leading players, along with application case studies and impartial assessment of the whole sector.

Detailed Forecasts

For the first time, this report provides detailed forecast breakdowns of the entire sector, including:

Forecasts in unit numbers for each technology type, for 2018-2028

Forecasts of average sales price for each technology type, for 2018-2028

Forecasts for total RFID sensor tag market value for each technology type, for 2018-2028

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/RFID-Sensors-2018-2028-Forecasts-Players-Opportunities-Annual-Market-Value-will-Reach-904-Million-1009268937RFID Sensors 2018-2028: Forecasts, Players, Opportunities - Annual Market Value will Reach $904 MillionDUBLIN, November 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

The "RFID Sensors 2018-2028: Forecasts, Players, Opportunities" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.

The general RFID market has seen substantial growth over the last few years, with successful public offerings and rapid growth in terms of the number of RFID tags sold. Vendors are now exploring allied technologies with RFID sensors at the forefront of this. This has been enabled thanks to new chipsets, at both HF(NFC) and UHF (RAIN) which are dedicated to support sensor platforms and therefore make RFID sensors simpler to make and lower cost in addition to the increasing maturity and wider scale adoption of RFID reader infrastructure. Additionally, new technologies from printed sensors and flexible batteries to bio sensing films meet unmet needs and provide differentiation.

Different technologies approach different market segments

Several different technology categories exist, namely:

1. Passive RFID sensors with no on board power source

2. Passive RFID tags with bio sensors, with no board power source

3. Battery assisted passive RFID sensors

4. "Chipless" RFID sensors - without a conventional silicon chip

From the above options, most can be bought to operate at either HF or UHF RFID, with HF RFID options offering a wider reader network thanks to NFC enabled consumer electronic devices albeit with limited read range of UHF devices with longer read range but requiring more expensive reader systems. The RF protocols developed for RFID are effectively being used as a means of data transfer of sensory information.

RFID Sensors 2018-2028 is the first report that covers all these options, the players behind the ICs, sensor tags and systems, the applications, trends and market size, forecast over a ten year period. The report draws comparisons form and assesses the related data logger market, and explores the role for RFID Sensors within that. SWOT (Strength, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) reports are given for the leading players, along with application case studies and impartial assessment of the whole sector.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/italian-surgeon-head-transplant-dog-experiment-2016-9The Italian surgeon who plans to do the world's first head transplant only has to solve these 5 problems firstTheWhy A clip from the video game ‘Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain,’ shows a man who shares Sergio Canavero’s exact likeness.

Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero made headlines around the world last year with the bold claim that he would soon be stitching someone’s head onto another person’s body.

His latest, renewed claim comes after his collaborators released video footage to several news outlets including a clip shown on Tuesday on Sky News. The video appears to show a dog stumbling on all fours and able to wag its tail. Sky News claims the video was shot three weeks after an experimental surgery was done to completely sever the dog’s spinal cord.

In a paper published on Monday in the journal Surgical Neurology International, Canavero details the technique used to treat the dog and claims that it will make a human head transplant — or more appropriately, full-body transplants — feasible next year.

But other experts are doubtful. The magazine New Scientist shared the papers with Case Western Reserve University neuroscientist Jerry Silver, who said, “These papers do not support moving forward in humans.” Importantly, the dog in the video did not have a full-body transplant, but merely had its spinal cord allegedly severed and then repaired.

Nevertheless, Canavero isn’t the only surgeon with dreams of performing what have been called head transplants, or more appropriately, full-body transplants, at some point in the future. Chinese orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Xiaoping Ren of Harbin Medical University recently told The New York Times that he was building a team to perform the procedure as well.

The idea of full-body transplants has been explored by numerous scientists looking both save people from deadly diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy, and extend life. But the challenges of such an endeavour are intense, to say the least. A handful of previous studies detailing such experiments were all short-lived — the animals in the experiments, usually mice, survived for a maximum of a few days after the procedure.

Here are five of the main obstacles scientists would have to overcome before doing such a transplant:

1. Heads can’t stay alive on their own

In any transplant, the donor organ (the one that has been taken from a donor’s body) has to be kept alive until it can be placed into the recipient’s body.

As soon as an organ gets removed from a body, it begins to die.

For things like heart or kidney transplants, doctors cool the organ to keep it viable for as long as possible. Cooling the organ helps reduce the amount of energy its cells need to stay alive.

Doctors accomplish this by bathing the organ in a solution of cold saltwater (saline). This process preserves kidneys for 48 hours, livers for 24 hours, and hearts for about five to 10 hours.

But a head would be a far more difficult process. A head isn’t just an isolated organ. It’s the heaviest and one of the most complex parts of the body. It houses not just your brain but also your eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and skin, as well as two separate gland systems: the pituitary, which controls the hormones that circulate throughout the body, and the salivary, which are responsible for producing saliva.

More than a century of disturbing animal research has shown that at the moment of decapitation, blood pressure in the head drops dramatically. The resulting loss of fresh blood and oxygen pushes the brain into a coma, soon followed by death.

This brings us to the next problem.

2. The immune system has to be coaxed into accepting a foreign head

As with any transplant, one of the main issues facing patients is that of their own body: If the immune system flags the foreign organ (or organs, in this case) as foreign, it can unleash a full-scale attack.

The immune system of the person receiving the new organ detects immune-triggering substances, called antigens, on the cells of the new organ. These antigens don’t match those found on your own organs. This is why almost all transplant patients take immune-suppressing drugs after their procedure.

Because the head is so complex and includes so many organs, the risk of rejection is much higher.

3. The surgery has to happen in under an hour

In a 1970s experiment that would never be allowed today, neurosurgeon Robert White transplanted the head of a monkey onto the body of a donor monkey. He maintained the monkey bodies by cooling them to about 59 degrees Fahrenheit for the duration of the procedure. The monkey with the transplanted head survived until the immune system rejected the head eight days after the surgery, and the monkey died.

One big catch, though: The whole thing has to be done in under an hour, according to White’s experiments and Canavero’s paper.

Canavero notes in his paper that both of the heads would have to be removed from their bodies at the same time. Working swiftly, the surgeons would have to reattach the head of the person they want to keep alive to the circulatory system of the donor’s body while both bodies are under total cardiac arrest. All of this would happen in less than an hour.

Canavero has also come under some fire recently for allegations that his claims are linked with a marketing ploy for a video game. Canavero told Business Insider last week that he had zero involvement with the game, “Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain,” and had never heard of the game’s producer or his company.

4. Spinal cords are (obviously) incredibly tricky to fuse

For the preserved head to be able to communicate with and control its new body, the spinal cord and the brain must be seamlessly connected, or fused.

This didn’t happen with the monkey transplant. While the monkey whose head was transplanted onto a donor body was able to see, move its eyes, and eat, it was paralysed from the neck down.

“The greatest technical hurdle” to a head transplant, Canavero writes in his paper, “is of course the reconnection of the donor’s (D)’s and recipients (R)’s spinal cords. It is my contention that the technology only now exists for such linkage.”

Canevero’s technology is “a special biological glue,” he said in a recent TED talk, called polyethylene glycol. Some experimental surgeons in the 1930s and 1940s used this material, which is a type of plastic, to fuse the spinal cords of dogs, but these experiments typically involved attaching a foreign head to the complete body of a dog (artificially giving it two heads), not replacing one dog’s head with that of another. These procedures were also done in less than an hour.

After the procedure, one of Canavero’s patients would be placed in a coma for up to a month to allow the spinal cords to fuse. Otherwise, the “spaghetti” (as he calls it) that makes up the spinal cord could become gnarled or twisted.

But such a long coma is a potential problem as well, Harry Goldsmith, a University of California at Davis professor of neurosurgery, told Popular Science, because medically induced comas often result in infection, blood clots, and reduced brain activity.

5. The procedure has to work in animal trials before being done in humans

Before head transplantation moves into trials in people, all of these problems have to be addressed in animal trials. And there are hurdles to getting animal experiments approved that involve so much cruelty. The bar for approving any such procedure, then, would have to involve proving that it is both helpful and necessary.

So far, there’s no concrete evidence that any of this is happening yet, and Canavero’s team’s video of the dog has yet to be verified, which means any type of surgery approaching this level of risk probably remains decades off, at the least.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-toll-tunnel-to-sydneys-northern-beaches-is-set-to-cost-1-billion-per-kilometre-2017-7The toll tunnel to Sydney's northern beaches is set to cost $1 billion per kilometreThe NSW government’s plan to build a 14-kilometre tunnel connecting Sydney’s inner west to the northern beaches could cost as much as $14 billion – nearly as much as WestConnex at more than twice the length, according to leaked documents.

Fairfax Media has seen confidential documents prepared for cabinet on the project, which at another $8 billion to the bill for maintenance and operational costs for the tollway over 35 years.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced plans for the tunnel in March, saying the tollway would relieve congestion on the northern beaches and cut travel times from the area to the CBD by up to 40 minutes. The proposed Beaches Link tunnel between Seaforth and Rozelle connects with the $17 billion 33km WestConnex tollway currently under construction. When it was first announced, WestConnex was priced at $10 billion.

Yesterday, Fairfax revealed that cabinet documents show the location of six tunnel exhaust stacks , with some just 200 metres from schools. As with the WestConnex project, where the location of exhaust stacks has caused similar concerns, the current proposal has the stacks releasing unfiltered exhaust emissions.

The $14 cost includes $5 billion for “contingencies and cost escalation” alongside a $5 construction costs, $2.3 billion in indirect cots and $340 million for property acquisitions, with an estimated 70 properties, including multi-million-dollar homes in leafy north shore suburbs such as Artarmon, Cammeray, Balgowlah and Seaforth on the potential chopping block.

Lifeline Animal Project, a nonprofit that runs multiple shelters in the Atlanta area, launched its first annual “Home for the Pawlidays” program this year. For the week surrounding Thanksgiving, the 20 dogs are staying “as special guests in people’s homes,” spokeswoman Karen Hirsch told “Today.” Lifeline provides food and supplies for the short-term foster homes during the week.

“We chose the dogs who had either been at the shelter the longest or who needed a break from the stress of the shelter the most,” Hirsch told HuffPost in an email. “All the dogs we chose are good candidates, because they adore people.”2

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-org-to-cut-ties-with-trump-soho-developed-with-sater-bayrock-2017-11The Trump Organisation is set to distance itself from one of its biggest headaches in the Russia probeThe Trump Organisation will end its contract with the real estate investment firm that owns the Trump SoHo hotel in New York, effectively ending Trump’s relationship with the troubled hotel.

In walking away early from the deal, the Trump Organisation will also distance itself from the controversial firm it worked with nearly a decade ago to develop the troubled hotel: Bayrock.

Bayrock and its cofounder, Felix Sater, are now under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Trump’s business dealings as part of his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow during the 2016 election.

The Trump Organisation will cut ties with New York’s Trump SoHo Hotel after years of financial hardship and even boycotts following Donald Trump’s presidential run and electoral victory in November.

In walking away early from the licensing deal it struck with the California-based real estate investment firm CIM Group, which owns Trump SoHo, the Trump Organisation will also distance itself from the controversial firm it worked with nearly a decade ago to develop the troubled hotel: Bayrock.

Trump worked with Bayrock on at least four projects throughout the 2000’s, including the Trump SoHo. Some of those projects ultimately failed. Bayrock was co-founded by the Russian-born businessman Felix Sater, who was accused nearly two decades ago of being a co-conspirator in a $US40 million fraud and money-laundering scheme involving four Mafia families.

A lawsuit brought in 2010 against Sater and others, which is ongoing, alleges that “for most of its existence [Bayrock] was substantially and covertly mob-owned and operated,” engaging “in a pattern of continuous, related crimes, including mail, wire, and bank fraud; tax evasion; money laundering; conspiracy; bribery; extortion; and embezzlement.”

The lawsuit, filed by Bayrock’s former finance director, Jody Kriss, accused Sater and Bayrock’s founder, Tevfik Arif, of cheating him out of millions of dollars via fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, among other misconduct. In December, a New York judge ruled that the lawsuit could move forward as a racketeering case.

Sater and Bayrock are now under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Trump’s business dealings as part of his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow during the 2016 election. Mueller is probing whether Russia ever held any financial leverage over Trump that was, or could be, used as blackmail.

‘It’s ridiculous that I wouldn’t be investing in Russia’

According to Kriss’ complaint, Sater and Arif began negotiating with the Trump Organisation in 2003 to market certain projects under the Trump brand but didn’t tell Trump about Sater’s criminal past.

In a 2007 deposition, Trump said his organisation would never have agreed to partner with Bayrock on the development of Trump SoHo had he known about Sater’s past. Trump also said he would not be able to identify Sater if they were in the same room.

But Bayrock’s office was once two floors below Trump’s in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. A person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution by Sater or his associates, told Business Insider that Sater and Trump had standing meetings each week.

Trump Organisation Felix Sater and Donald Trump

Sater has said in a deposition that he met with Trump “on a constant basis,” Bloomberg previously reported, and Kriss told the publication that Trump valued Sater’s loyalty – and his Russia connections.

“It’s ridiculous that I wouldn’t be investing in Russia,” Trump said in the 2007 deposition. “Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment.”

Sater was evidently still in touch with Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as recently as late January.

The two met at a New York hotel on January 27 to discuss a peace plan for Russia and Ukraine that was drafted by a Ukrainian politician, Andrey Artemenko. Cohen was said to have delivered the plan directly to Michael Flynn before he resigned as national security adviser on February 13, though Cohen has disputed that in subsequent interviews.

‘I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected’

Sater came back into the news over the summer when emails surfaced showing that he had been pushing for the Trump Organisation to pursue a massive real-estate deal in Moscow during the 2016 presidential election.

Emails exchanged between Sater and Cohen – who have known each other since they were teenagers – in November 2015 indicate that they were preparing to celebrate not only Trump’s election victory, but also the potential Russia deal. The Trump Organisation, which employed Cohen at the time, had signed a letter of intent to pursue the deal.

Sater boasted of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the emails, which were obtained by The New York Times, telling Cohen that he would “get all of Putins team to buy in” on the Moscow deal.

“Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater wrote. “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.”

Two months later, Cohen emailed Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, asking for his “assistance” in pushing the deal through, according to emails submitted to congressional investigators and read to The Washington Post.

“Over the past few months I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding the development of a Trump Tower – Moscow project in Moscow City,” Cohen wrote Peskov. “Without getting into lengthy specifics the communication between our two sides has stalled…As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance.”

Cohen sent the email to a generic Kremlin email address that was not Peskov’s. The Kremlin said later that it had received the email, but Cohen told The Post that he never heard back – and that the deal was scrapped by late January 2016.

Sater was spotted at Trump Tower about six months after the deal collapsed. He told Politico at the time that the purpose of his visit was “confidential.” But his presence there seven months after the Moscow real-estate deal fell through, and less than three months before Election Day, raised questions about who in Trump’s orbit he was still in touch with – and why.

Sater showed Ivanka Trump and her brother Donald Trump Jr. around Moscow in 2006 when their father was scouting real estate in Russia. They stayed for several days at the Hotel National Moscow opposite the Kremlin, according to The Times.

Sater also acted as a fixer to help the former Kazakh cabinet minister Viktor Khrapunov buy three apartments in Trump SoHo using shell companies, the Financial Times reported. The Kazakh government has alleged that Khrapunov stole those funds from the state.

Khrapunov’s use of shell companies to buy Trump real estate was not unique – a USA Today investigation found that approximately 70% of buyers of Trump properties since June 2016 were limited-liability companies, compared with about 4% of buyers in the two years before.

https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/11/cassini-swan-song-image-of-saturn-left-me-speechlessCassini Swan Song Image Of Saturn Left Me SpeechlessPlanets and robots lack hearts and minds, but they're especially good at impacting ours. In its last days before ending itself, human-built Cassini turned around and snapped this farewell mosaic image of Saturn. Its title: "Farewell to Saturn."

I don't have the words to accurately describe the photo's sublimity. I suggest you take a minute to view it full screen - and you might be left speechless, too. Here's a high-resolution shot.

Cassini met its end dropping into the ringed planet's atmosphere on 15 September 2017, after 13 years of Saturn science. Its numerous accomplishments included dropping a probe and discovering liquid methane oceans on Titan and finding plumes on the moon Enceladus. When it finally met its end, it left us emotional.

As its swan song, the "Farewell to Saturn" mosaic shows a dramatic image of the planet in shadows like a crescent moon. But zoom in and you can discern the individual rings; strata of hydrogen, helium and ammonia in its atmosphere; and even six of its moons, including Enceladus. The image consists of 42 images selected from 80 total taken in two hours. It was taken from a distance of 1,123,000km.

Use this moment to take in an incredible piece of human accomplishment requiring 260 scientists and countless hours to give us a glimpse at (arguably) the most beautiful of the Solar System's planets.

And finally, with mysteries left unsolved and even the prospects of life, let's get another spacecraft back to Saturn soon.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/argentina-missing-submarine-what-we-know_us_5a16ea55e4b0d4906cada57d?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009The Mysterious Disappearance Of An Argentine Navy Sub Just Got Even StrangerAs the desperate, multinational search for a missing Argentine submarine continues, the country’s navy said on Thursday that a sound “consistent with an explosion” had been detected near the site where the vessel disappeared last week with 44 crew members on board.

Captain Enrique Balbi, a navy spokesman, said an “abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event” had been detected in the South Atlantic ocean on the morning of Nov. 15. That was around the same time the ARA San Juan sent out its last signal, reported Reuters.

The search for the missing vessel, which has enough air to last only seven to 10 days if fully immersed, has been intensifying as several countries participate in a massive search covering some 187,000 square miles.

Here’s what we know about the search so far:

When did the San Juan last make contact?

The last communication between the diesel-electric powered submarine and onshore authorities was at 7.30 a.m. on Nov. 15. The vessel had been heading from the southern port of Ushuaia to a naval base in Mar del Plata, about 260 miles south of Buenos Aires. It had been scheduled to arrive at its destination on Sunday.

Shortly before disappearing, the San Juan’s captain reported a battery failure due to a “short circuit” on board. He later said the issue had been fixed.

According to the Argentine navy, such failures are considered routine and the vessel’s crew had been reported safe at the time, per CNN. Still, the captain was reportedly ordered to change course and take a more direct route to Mar del Plata.

On Saturday, the Argentine Defense Ministry said it had detected seven communication attempts from the San Juan. That, however, turned out to be untrue.

What could have happened?

The submarine’s apparent failure to use any distress signals or mechanisms has troubled experts because it suggests the submarine could have been “quickly and devastatingly incapacitated by a cataclysmic event onboard,” noted the Los Angeles Times.

William Craig Reed, a former U.S. Navy diver and submarine expert, told CNN that the submarine could have suffered some sort of “catastrophic failure” or it “could be something minor that has caused them to either be hung up somewhere or they are on the bottom.”

The Argentine navy said on Thursday that there was no sign the submarine had been attacked.

How is the search effort going?

Thousands of military personnel, more than a dozen aircraft and 15 vessels from countries including Brazil, Britain, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Peru, the United States and Uruguay are searching for the vessel.

Finding a submarine, which is difficult to detect by design, is significantly more challenging than locating a surface vessel, experts say.

The search has also be hampered by poor weather, with storms causing strong winds and waves of up to 20 feet in the search area.

How long can the submarine last at sea?

Balbi, the Argentine navy spokesman, said the submarine has enough food, water, fuel and oxygen to operate for 90 days without external help. However, that only applies if the vessel can raise a snorkel to the surface “to charge batteries and draw fresh air for the crew.”

If the submarine has been fully submerged and unable to surface, its oxygen supply may only last about seven days.

Wednesday marked the seventh day since the vessel disappeared.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/23/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-holidays/index.htmlFor Puerto Ricans, a bittersweet holiday seasonSan Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- On the southeastern coast of this island, where Hurricane Maria made landfall two months ago, the waves of the Caribbean lash the crumbling foundation of Jose Morales' battered seaside home.

A year ago, the Morales clan kicked off the holidays in Yabucoa with a large outdoor gathering that included turkey and a traditional pig roast. Not this year.

"This year there will be no Christmas," says Morales, who is 74 and legally blind. "Those who can will enjoy the holidays. We can't. We'll be here. Living in fear, in danger."

Up the road, his sister Paula Morales, 67, sits in a plastic chair -- one of two pieces of furniture in her living room -- under the blue plastic tarp that has replaced her roof. A small painting of a clown, one of the few things she salvaged after the storm, hangs on the wall.

At night, Morales (pictured above) sits by candlelight or the glare of her battery-operated lamp and listens to the crashing waves. Most of her belongings lie in a pile outside what's left of her cinder block house.

"I can't think about the holidays right now," she says, eating white rice and red beans from a small plate. "I have too many worries."

Jose Morales lives in fear his damaged home in Yabucoa will be swept into the Caribbean.

A marathon season of revelry

For many Puerto Ricans, Thanksgiving is usually the start of a marathon season of revelry that ends around January 6 with Three Kings' Day, when families hold festive gatherings and children leave shoe boxes full of grass -- the equivalent of cookies for Santa -- for the wise men's camels.

"The way we celebrate ... is not (just) Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's," said Cynthia García Coll, an educational psychologist who lives in Dorado, near the capital city of San Juan. "It's every weekend. You have cousins on another part of the island. So the next weekend the whole family goes to the other side of the island."

Hurricane Maria's assault on the island has changed all that.

Much of this US territory, from urban centers to rural hamlets, still lacks electricity and running water. Even San Juan suffers occasional blackouts caused by the destruction of an outdated power grid. The storm hammered an island whose 3.4 million citizens were already grappling with unemployment and poverty.

Reminders of the devastation are everywhere. Still-damp piles of debris and personal belongings lost to the storm. Downed utility poles and trees. Shuttered schools and businesses.

There is the incessant buzz of emergency generators, and the constant smell of the diesel fuel that powers them. Blue, government-issue tarps cover damaged roofs like a network of Band-Aids.

So this holiday season, as their fellow Americans on the mainland eat leftover turkey and shop for gifts, many Puerto Ricans will still be struggling just to feed and shelter themselves.

"With Maria, the foundations of society -- the wheels -- fell off," says Dr. Domingo Marqués, a clinical psychologist who lives in San Juan.

"Thanksgiving and Christmas, instead of being holidays, will be a reminder that we are still victims," adds Marqués, whose home is still without power. "The holidays will be a trigger for trauma for a lot of people. I'm really worried about that.

"How are you going to feel if you can't give your family a holiday?"

'We're dreading the holidays'

Early signs of the Christmas season are blossoming across the island like the green shoots sprouting on trees stripped bare by Maria. Colorful holiday signs and tinsel trees adorn some homes and businesses. Folksy Christmas songs blare from car radios.

Despite their many hardships, some Puerto Ricans are trying to stay positive.

"There is no going back to normal. It's not going to be like before. And that's not necessarily a bad thing," says Marqués, the clinical psychologist from San Juan. "We're going to be more resilient. My son and my daughter are going to be stronger than they were supposed to be. We're going to have more pride as a country. We're going to be better."

Roberto Silva: "We have to find a place between pain and happiness."

"This could be the Christmas that moves Puerto Rico forward," agrees musician Roberto Silva, one of the island's leading backcountry troubadours. "The FEMA tarps are covering up a terrible social and economic crisis. We have to find a place between pain and happiness."

But the devastation wrought by Maria has even affluent Puerto Ricans unsure about how or what to celebrate.

"We're dreading the holidays," said García Coll, the psychologist, who works in San Juan.

Even deciding on a place for Thanksgiving dinner for about 30 extended family members was a problem.

"Nobody has water," she says. "Nobody has electricity stable enough to be able to do it. We are the privileged ones. We have much more than the rest of the island. We're not spending Thanksgiving Day as a family -- which is really a loss already. And we're looking at Christmas, and we have no idea what do."

The holiday season in Puerto Rico is typically marked by parrandas, a time-honored form of Christmas caroling in which families and friends gather and move from house to house, singing and dancing. The roving carolers can arrive unexpectedly at all hours and often come inside to eat and drink before taking the party to the next home.

This year, those celebrations will be more muted. But many Puerto Ricans say they're still planning to hold traditional parrandas. Marqués says co-workers at the graduate school of psychology where he teaches are planning on taking the roaming parties to rural mountain towns this holiday season.

Workers repair a damaged road in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, a month after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island.

His co-workers also have been raising money to donate solar lanterns and water filtration systems to people in the countryside, he says. And they're trying to persuade stores to donate toys for needy children.

"They deserve it," he says of hurricane survivors in remote parts of the island. "We're the quote-unquote 'privileged ones'... The people in the mountains, in isolated communities, they feel betrayed. They feel angry. The government is not there."

A town struggles

In Comerío, a town in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, hundreds of residents showed up Sunday in a driving rain for a pre-Thanksgiving feast of roast pork, yellow rice and pigeon peas.

SOMOS Healthcare, a New York-based nonprofit, sponsored the meal and set up permanent clinics in two remote towns hit hard by Maria.

"More than ever, there is a need for the holidays," says Jose Antonio Santiago, Comerío's mayor. "There is a collective depression that comes from a lack of the most basic necessities."

The first emergency roof tarps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not arrive in town until nearly two months after Maria hit on September 20, Santiago says. More than 1,600 homes in the town had roofs damaged or blown away entirely, he says.

About 1,470 people remain in shelters throughout the island, according to the government. But Santiago says that figure doesn't take into account the large number of displaced residents not living in shelters.

"I have some 5,000 refugees," he says. "You don't see them because they're staying with relatives, friends and neighbors. That's two and three families in one house without light or water."

Santiago says brigades working to restore power on the island have yet to arrive in Comerío, a mere 27 miles southwest of San Juan.

"The slow recovery has led to emotional fatigue," he says. "The official figures do not reflect the reality on the ground."

'This Christmas will be different'

A short distance to the northwest, in the hilly town of Corozal, 12-year-old Ian Nieves sits in the elementary school that has sheltered his family since Hurricane Maria hit. He covers his eyes, fighting back tears, as he tries to recall his blessings this holiday season.

"This Christmas will be different than all others," he says.

Ian Nieves and his brother Elian, 6, cannot return to their nearby home, which sits on a hillside vulnerable to mudslides and remains badly damaged.

Ian Nieves, 12, outside the school where his family has lived since the storm hit.

Their school is still closed, so the boys spend their days riding bicycles, shooting hoops in the hot sun and playing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles board game. Their great-grandmother prepares breakfast, lunch and dinner in a corner of the classroom she now calls home.

"I miss home so much," Elian says.

Ian recalls last year's holiday season, the parrandas and the large spreads of food that included traditional desserts of arroz con leche, rice cooked with coconut milk, sugar and spices, and a coconut milk custard known as tembleque. "We had the whole family together," he says.

The boys also miss three of their cousins -- ages 6, 9, 13 -- who lived down the street but left the island for Pennsylvania about a month after the storm. Many Puerto Ricans have fled the island in recent weeks to stay with relatives or in hotels on the mainland.

"I cried so much that day," Elian says. "I don't know when they'll be back."

Elian Nieves, 6, gave his donated clothes to friends who were needier.

Ian hopes to get new clothes for Christmas. Elian wants a scooter and a juice mug to replace the one -- it was yellow, with a smiley face -- he lost in the hurricane.

The younger boy says he recently received a donation of new clothing and shoes but gave some away to friends who needed them more.

"They have nothing," he says. "They lost it all in the storm."

'Please come see me for Christmas'

Across the island in Yabucoa, Jose Morales and his wife Irma Torres live down a muddy road in a yellow house where one room has no roof. The ceilings in two other rooms appear close to collapsing.

And the relentless ocean waves are threatening what is left.

"The lower wall, by the sea, is in danger is falling," says Morales, a former fisherman who lost his eyesight 12 years ago. "It scares me at night. I hear the waves hitting it. I feel it."

Irma Torres at her home in Yabucoa. She hopes her nephew in the US will visit for Christmas.

The couple have no place else to go. They live on about $300 a month in food stamps and Social Security benefits. And like the rest of their family nearby, they have been subsisting on rice and cans of Vienna sausage, corned beef and sardines.

Torres asks a reporter if she could borrow his phone to call a nephew in Connecticut. When she hears her nephew's voice on the phone, she starts crying.

"God bless you," she tells him. "You know I love you very much."

She's surprised to learn it's her nephew's birthday. She didn't know. She asks him to visit soon, and to bring cake and medicine for her respiratory disorder.

"We've been waiting for FEMA," she says to him. "Please come see me for Christmas. Give my best to your mother. I love you."

After she hangs up, Torres manages a smile. It's her first in a while.

Christmas is five weeks away.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/23/us/cyntoia-brown-social-media-murder-case-trnd/index.htmlWhy Cyntoia Brown, who is spending life in prison for murder, is all over social media(CNN) This week, the case of a woman named Cyntoia Brown went viral on social media, even though she has already been in jail for more than ten years.

Brown is serving a life sentence for the murder of a Nashville man in 2004. According to Brown, after a childhood marked by abuse and drugs, she was raped and forced into prostitution by a pimp, and ended up killing one of her clients out of self defense when she was just 16 years old. Despite her youth, she was tried as an adult and given a life sentence.

The details of her crime and trial -- including the fact that the man who had paid for sex with her was 43 years old, have started circulating again, catching the attention of A-list celebrities and spawning the viral hashtag #FreeCyntoiaBrown. However, even before the renewed interest, her trial inspired a documentary and was a factor in a major change in how the state of Tennessee deals with child prostitution cases.

How a years-old case ignited new interest

Though it's unclear why, specifically, Brown's story came back into the spotlight, a text post describing Brown's history and trial appeared to pick up serious steam when it was shared by singer Rihanna on Instagram.-1

- 2 dashes Angostura bitters

- 1 orange twist as garnish

Ramos Gin Fizz Here's another New Orleans gem. Henry C. Ramos, the drink's creator, originally demanded that the drink be shaken for 12 minutes. Luckily for everyone, that herculean effort is no longer required. Put all the ingredients except the club soda into a shaker without ice. Seriously shake it up. Then add ice into the mixture and shake it up again. Strain it into a glass. And finally, pour the club soda back and forth between the empty parts of the shaker to scoop up any leftover egg white, and add it into the drink. Ingredients: - 2 oz. gin

- 1/2 oz. heavy cream

- 1/2 oz. fresh lemon juice

- 1/2 oz. fresh lime juice

- 3/4 oz. simple syrup

- 3 dashes orange flower water

To make the drink, add all the ingredients into a shake with ice. Shake and then strain into a chilled glass. Add some raspberries for garnish. Ingredients: - 2 oz. gin

- 1 egg white

- 1/2 oz. fresh lemon juice

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/iron-ore-relationship-to-steel-prices-2017-11Why iron ore prices are unlikely to fall much further, in one chartNow here’s a chart that will undoubtedly embolden the iron ore bulls out there.

Posted by Robert Rennie, Westpac’s head of market strategy, on Twitter today, it shows the iron ore spot price overlaid against spot prices for rebar, hot-rolled and steel billet product.

Source: Westpac

One thing immediately stands out: the relationship between steel and iron ore prices has broken down over the past year with steel prices jumping to six-year highs while iron ore remains anchored near one-year lows.

Rennie says that high steel prices, leading to elevated steel mill margins, will make it hard for iron ore prices to fall much further should they stay at current levels.

“As long as these super high steel prices remain in China, it’s hard to generate a scenario where iron ore can fall much,” he says.

Adding credence to that view, iron ore spot markets — after a period of choppy trade in recent months — surged higher on Wednesday, hitting the highest level since September 21.

The price for benchmark 62% fines surged by 4.3% to $65.17 a tonne, according to Metal Bulletin, its largest increase since November 6.

The move followed another strong lift in rebar futures in Shanghai earlier in the session, boosted by low inventory levels and optimism over continued strong demand.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/australia-housing-market-slowdown-economic-impact-2017-11Why Australia's housing market slowdown won't wreak havoc on the economyCoogee beach. Brendon Thorne/Getty Images

Australia’s housing market is cooling after years of strong, predominantly debt-fuelled price growth.

Prices in Sydney — the nation’s largest and most expensive housing market — have fallen in each of the past two months, according to data released by CoreLogic, coinciding with a noticeable decline in auction clearance rates over the same period.

And while not to the same degree as Sydney, at least not yet, Melbourne’s housing market is also starting to cool. Price growth in the city slowed to its lowest level since mid-2016 in the three months to October, with clearance rates also sliding to the lowest level in over a year.

The combination of affordability constraints and increased stock availability, particularly in Sydney, along with measures introduced by Australia’s banking regulator, APRA, to curb investor and interest-only housing finance growth, meant the rollicking price gains in recent years have now come to an end.

At a time when the economy is not all that strong, particularly the all-important household sector, it has caused some angst about what the slowdown in Sydney and Melbourne may mean to the broader Australian economy, particularly given signs that other smaller markets are now also starting to slow.

What does it mean for the outlook for residential construction and household spending, the largest part of the Australian economy at around 60%? And, if these start to weaken as a result of the price slowdown, what will that mean for economic growth, the outlook for labour market conditions, inflationary pressures and official interest rates?

We’ve already seen weakness in recent Australian retail sales reports, casting a worrying picture on the health of household finances given high levels of indebtedness, weak wage growth and higher electricity, gas and petrol costs since the start of the September quarter.

Coupled with a slowdown in residential building approvals, a lead indicator on the outlook for residential construction, it’s clear why some commentators have adopted the view that Australian economic growth will likely disappoint in 2018, keeping pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to maintain or even lower interest rates despite ongoing concerns about potential financial instability.

However, while some remain concerned about what the futures holds, Paul Bloxham, Chief Australia and New Zealand Economist at HSBC, is not, pointing out that there’s likely to be some offsetting factors that will keep economic growth humming along nicely in 2018.

“Thankfully, the fall in dwelling investment is arriving just as the mining investment drag is coming to its end and, importantly, the drag from mining was much bigger,” he says.

“The mining investment decline is set to go from a maximum drag of around 1.5 percentage points (ppts) of GDP in mid-2016, to no drag at all by mid-2018.

“By comparison, the dwelling investment contribution to growth, which was a maximum of around 0.5ppts of GDP in mid-2016, is forecast to be a drag of around 0.25ppts by 2019.

“The collective effect from these two sectors is that a net drag on GDP of around 1ppt in mid-2016 is set to be almost no drag at all in 2018 and 2019.”

Source: HSBC

The point Bloxham is making is that the Australian economy is a series of moving parts, and while residential dwelling investment will likely detract from GDP next year, that will be largely offset by an end to the unwind in the mining infrastructure boom.

As for the threat posed to household consumption by continued weakness in the housing market, Bloxham says that its effect is unlikely to be as bad as some other commentators make out.

“The argument is that households will be less inclined to spend as the cooling of the housing boom means they are no longer seeing wealth gains. However, in our view, there has been little evidence of a positive wealth effect in recent years, so we see a large negative wealth effect as unlikely,” he says.

Bloxham dismisses the suggestion that the recent decline in Australia’s household savings ratio is a sign that higher house prices helped to encourage households to spend more in recent years.

“Although the national household saving rate has fallen in recent years, the state-level numbers show that the saving rate has not fallen in the states which have had housing prices boom [such as New South Wales and Victoria],” he says.

“If the rise in wealth had driven households to consume more, surely it would have happened in the states where wealth has been rising? Instead, household saving rates have only fallen in the mining states, after rising during the mining boom.”

“The moves in household saving rates therefore appear to reflect the impact of the resources cycle on incomes, not a wealth effect.”

Source: HSBC

Rather than housing wealth dictating household spending patterns in recent years, Bloxham says changes in Australian household income growth has been far more influential, noting that weakness in household consumption has been due to the slow growth in household incomes reflecting weak jobs and wages growth at the end of the mining boom.

However, while there’s still a large degree of uncertainty as to what degree wage pressures — the largest part of household income — will lift should labour market conditions continue to improve, Bloxham remains optimistic on the outlook for worker wages.

“The cyclical factors are now supportive of a pick-up in wages growth,” he says.

“Commodity prices have lifted, corporate profitability has improved, business conditions are at high levels and, critically, the labour market is tightening up.

“Our central case is that the cyclical factors, particularly the tightening of the labour market, will see a pick-up in wages growth in 2018, which will complete Australia’s ‘great rebalancing act’.”

And with wage pressures set to build in his opinion, Bloxham says Australian economic growth in 2018 will be both faster and broader than in recent years.

“We expect growth to be more broad-based across industries and regions than it has been in at least a decade,” he says, pointing out that increased government infrastructure investment, along with booming tourism and education exports, will also act to buttress growth.

Bloxham, echoing recent uncertainty from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), says the biggest risk to his view will be if structural factors in the labour market such as technology, offshoring, decreased unionisation and an increasing casualisation of the workforce limit wage pressures longer than he expects.

“The clear risk is that this process takes longer than we have factored in, as the structural factors continue to offset the impact of the positive cyclical forces,” he says.

“The outlook for wages growth remains the main focus of the story.”

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/Lurento-Expands-Luxury-and-Sports-Car-Rental-Business-to-Dubai-Abu-Dhabi-1009273859Lurento Expands Luxury and Sports Car Rental Business to Dubai, Abu DhabiLONDON, Nov. 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Premium car rental marketplace, Lurento, has announced the launch of its service in the United Arab Emirates. Customers can now rent luxury and sports cars in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

"Dubai is a leading location for luxury travelers and sports car enthusiasts alike. Our customers will have the opportunity to choose from a lot of models this holiday season, along with the best deals. In addition to top European brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Mercedes and BMW, Lurento now offers Cadillac, GMC, Lincoln and other premium cars from US brands," says Milan Krstanovic, Partner Relations Manager.

As the largest luxury car rental service, Lurento offers an unparalleled selection of premium cars, luxury cars, sports cars, and supercars. Launched in 2016, Lurento has quickly increased its European operation, and is now based in 80 cities across the continent. The launch into the United Arab Emirates marks the next chapter in the firm's exciting and ambitious expansion strategy, and is the company's first venture outside Europe.

"While the premium and luxury car segment is covered by traditional car rental operators, the offering is more fragmented than the broader sector with a significant number of smaller, independent operators. This creates friction in the market, as independent operators often lack visibility to inbound travelers. Potential clients may, on the other hand, be wary of dealing with unfamiliar providers. Lurento bridges this gap through offering a neutral venue for operators and clients to interact, increasing visibility for small providers covering this niche segment while facilitating the process and creating trust for customers to rent their dream cars or specific, premium models," says Nicolay Nedrelid, Founder & Corporate Advisor at Nedrelid Corporate Advisory, an independent consulting boutique focused on the car rental industry.

As two of the world's most popular travel destinations, Dubai and Abu Dhabi offer a wide range of activities for the discerning traveler, with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix just one of the many highlights pulling in sports car fans from around the globe.

"With such strong supply and a lot of requests from our clients, we've decided to accept partner companies and make their inventory available for customers worldwide. It will also serve as sandbox for a number of features we'll test to improve our service and provide the perfect rental experience for our customers," says Mihailo Dhoric, CEO.

The next five years are anticipated to be a period of fast growth in the region too, with the government announcing projects such as The Dubai Marina development to further add to the region's tourism credentials. While VAT will be introduced in 2018 at a rate of 5 percent, it is not expected to have a significant impact on the car rental sector.

About Lurento

Europe's leading marketplace for luxury and sports car rental redefines the car rental experience for companies, clients and fast cars enthusiasts. Powered by technology, data and artificial intelligence, Lurento has lowered the entry cost into the luxury car rental market, making prestigious cars available to a wider audience. Lurento helps local car rental companies utilize unused inventory, prevent theft and fraud and get access to clients worldwide.

LAS VEGAS — The top lawman in Las Vegas says the gunman who killed dozens of people at a concert last month fired more than 1,100 rounds.

The newly released estimate from Sheriff Joe Lombardo offers more detail about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Lombardo tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was aware of the previously unreported figure because his department’s forensics lab is working with the FBI to process all ballistics evidence.

Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured hundreds more on Oct. 1 after he shattered windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed withering gunfire at the music festival below before killing himself.

Authorities have said they have not determined Paddock’s motive or why he stopped shooting. Lombardo says authorities found about 4,000 unused rounds in the suite.-2

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah – Justin Holiday believes in unicorns.

After all, he spent last season in New York playing alongside a 7-foot-3 one named Kristaps Porzingis.

“Unreal talent … size and talent,’’ Holiday said of his experience with Porzingis.

And while Porzingis is deemed the first unicorn in the NBA – thanks to Kevin Durant nicknaming him that – there are sightings popping up throughout the Association.

Milwaukee feels like they have one in Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Philadelphia loves what Joel Embiid is becoming.

“They’re sprouting up all over,’’ Holiday joked.

So what defines an NBA unicorn these days? A 7-footer who can shoot from three-point range, score inside, and basically does it all on both ends of the floor.

A description that Bulls rookie Lauri Markkanen doesn’t shy away from wanting to reach soon, even if at age 20 he can only claim baby unicorn status these days.

“That’s definitely a personal goal for me, just to change the game and be one of those top guys, those 7-footers that can do it all,’’ Markkanen said. “That’s ultimately where I want to be.’’

And ultimately where he still isn’t.

“I think he’s going in the right direction to get towards that for sure,’’ Holiday said of Markkanen. “Obviously everything he does on that court is what we need, and he does do everything well. I guess it comes down to how it happens consistently down the road.’’

That’s what Markkanen lacks right now. Yes, he needs more strength and the good news is he’s a willing participant in putting in weight room time, but as the last few games of this current four-game road trip have shown it’s about consistency.

Before Los Angeles and Utah happened, Markkanen was shooting 45 percent from the field and 37 percent from three-point range. In those last two losses, however, the seventh overall pick shot a combined 5-for-26 (19 percent) and just 2-for-13 (15 percent) from beyond the three-point line.

The three points in the 110-80 Wednesday blowout loss to the Jazz was a season low.

“The think we really like about Lauri is he won’t let a bad game keep him from shooting,’’ coach Fred Hoiberg said. “He’s fearless that way.

“I really do believe that the sky is the limit for Lauri because there’s just not many guys in this league that can score from every area on the floor.’’

Scoring isn’t all Markkanen wants to show, either.

He once again brought up the stereotype that Euro players – especially bigs – are believed to be on the soft side. A label he’s also looking to smash.

“Yeah, I definitely think that stereotype exists,’’ Markkanen said. “I know where I am right now and it’s not like I’m some freak athlete or anything like that, but I think there’s definitely a stereotype for guys like me. Hopefully I can change that.’’

Holiday agreed.

“That label doesn’t pertain to his game at all,’’ Holiday said. “That I know.’’0

The early birds will inherit the earth.

At least, that’s what a 2009 University of Leipzig study found. The researchers concluded that “morning people were more proactive than evening types.”

However, being an effective early riser isn’t just about waking up before everyone else. It’s about putting yourself in a positive mindset and getting important things done before everyone else.

So there’s no point in setting your alarm clock at a crazy early time if you’re just going to zone out in front of the television for a bit before slouching off to work.

In order to to start your day right, you’ve got to get into some good habits.

Here are seven morning rituals that may seem hard to adopt, but will ultimately reap major rewards, if you stick with them:

As the retail industry counts down to Amazon Australia’s soft launch on Thursday afternoon, it has become increasingly clear what products Australian consumers can expect to see on the site.

In recent days, everything from heaters to computer accessories have temporarily appeared on the site, despite not being available to purchase.

Today, sports shoes and apparel from brands including Adidas, Asics and New Balance were seen on Amazon.com.au. All of which did not have prices listed and have since been removed from public view.

As it has for many years, the front page of Amazon.com.au is still only showing as a bookshop. But on Monday night, Amazon emailed Australian third party merchants telling them to prepare for sales from 2pm on Thursday when the general goods site would be opened to a limited number of customers.

Other products which have been seen on the local site over the last two weeks include household items from Dyson and Sunbeam, in-house branded AmazonBasics products, and exposure of HP computing devices.

Amazon Australia has not commented on Thursday afternoon’s soft launch, although there have been reports that ice cream makers have been commissioned to give out free promotional treats at major railway stations in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/example-cold-email-linkedin-message-2017-4Here's the cold LinkedIn message that prompted a CEO to give the sender a jobTechCrunch/Flickr. Licensed under Creative Commons 2.0 ‘You are never going to get what you don’t ask for.’ Kathryn Minshew pictured.

Kathryn Minshew, cofounder and CEO of careers advice and job listings site The Muse, wasn’t yet looking to hire a head of marketing in 2012.

Then she received a LinkedIn message from Elliot Bell that changed her mind. Bell was hired as the director of marketing a few months later; he worked at The Muse for four years.

Here’s the full text of the LinkedIn Message he sent Minshew. It’s reprinted in “The New Rules of Work,” the new book Minshew co-authored with her cofounder Alex Cavoulacos, who is COO of The Muse.

Hi Kathryn,

While slightly out of place, I attended the Women 2.0 conference yesterday with EatDrinkJobs and had the chance to see you pitch. I was blown away by you, your team, and most of all, your company.

I spent six years at Seamless.com, working closely with amazing leaders like Jason Finger (who you know well). I see such amazing potential in your company, and I would love to be a part of it in any way. My primary focus in marketing, with a lot of experience marketing to the same corporations and users you seem to be attracting. I’d love to tell you more about how my skill set could help you all reach and exceed your current growth goals.

Congrats on all your current success. Again, I’d love to find a time to chat more about the company and tell you how I could help.

Best,

Elliott

In an interview with Business Insider, Minshew broke down exactly why Bell’s message was so compelling:

He included something personal — that he’d seen her speak at a conference.

He said something nice about her — that she and her team blew him away.

He made it clear that he was excited to work with The Muse specifically, and not just any company.

He included two sentences about his background, which was just enough information so that Kathryn could see if he’d be a fit.

He mentioned the name of a mutual connection, so Kathryn could ask that connection about Bell.

He didn’t make an ask that went overboard, like a 30-minute phone call tomorrow (that’s a request Minshew has received).

In an article for The Muse, Bell wrote that the message took all of two minutes to write.

Cavoulacos told Business Insider about the rationale behind sending a cold email (or LinkedIn message):

“You are never going to get what you don’t ask for. And what was the worst-case scenario here? Kathryn didn’t see the email; didn’t read the email; she wrote back and said, ‘Sorry, no.’ You’re literally in the exact same position you were before.”

Her observation echoes something Liz Wessel, a former Googler and current CEO of WayUp, previously told Business Insider about cold emailing: “Don’t question yourself. Worst case, they don’t respond, and then who cares? Seriously, who cares? Cold email for sure.”

Wessel asks all her employees at WayUp to cold email their idol; you can find her tips on crafting the perfect cold email here.

If you’re still struggling to muster up the courage to send a cold message, consider framing the approach differently in your head. As Minshew told Business Insider, “The person on the other end might be just as excited to find someone to work with.”

But what if you cooked a turkey from the inside out? That's what Allen Pan tried by filling a raw turkey with molten aluminium and then letting the whole thing cook, cool and solidify, en route to a friend's Thanksgiving party.

The results were, well, disastrous. It turns out there's a good reason the Butterball hotline doesn't recommend, or even suggest, filling a raw turkey with melted metal. Parts of the bird were cooked, but the rest of it was still raw by dinner time, as most of the molten aluminium had poured out a hole it had burned through the bottom of the turkey. The only salvageable part was an aluminium cast of the bird's neck, which would at least give you a lovely centrepiece for next year's Thanksgiving.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/21/amazon-marketplace-is-launching-in-australia-on-thursday-sort-of_a_23284751/Amazon Marketplace Is Launching In Australia On Thursday. Sort Of.After months of speculation, analysis and hype, Amazon has confirmed its launch date for Australia -- and it's just around the corner.

Amazon's Marketplace -- an eBay-esque online retail store featuring third-party sellers -- will go live from 2pm on Thursday, according to emails sent to retailers signed up to sell their products on the platform.

This means it will be operational for the annual pre-Christmas discount shopping frenzy known as "Black Friday" on November 24 and the subsequent "Cyber Monday" online discounting event.

But don't get out your credit cards just yet.

In an email sent to Amazon Marketplace's third-party retailers and published by Life Hacker, Amazon described the launch as "an internal testing phase" which will only be available to "a small number of customers".

"You should be prepared to receive orders from this point onwards," the email informs suppliers.

"We are very excited to have you on board during this testing phase."

You'll soon be able to get Amazon purchases delivered to your home.

It's not clear who those customers might be or how they'll be selected, although it's likely they'll only be available for delivery within major cities, with Melbourne at the top of the list.

In August, the south-east Melbourne suburb of Dandenong South became the site of Amazon's first Australian "fulfillment centre", the name of Amazon's warehouses used for distributing products to customers.

Amazon has sent multiple shock waves through the retail market since rumours of its arrival in Australia began early last year.

Claims about Amazon's impact have ranged from the grandiose -- that it will herald a "retail revolution", destroying shopping as we know it -- to the painfully specific, like that it will wipe 16 percent off discretionary retailers' earnings and 14 percent from grocery stores' within three to five years.

The managing director of Coles' owner Wesfarmers, Richard Goyder, warned as long ago as March 2016 that Amazon will "eat all our breakfasts, lunches and dinners" unless Australian retailers become more innovative and barriers to competition are removed.

And these fears are not without foundation.

The US behemoth's size will allow it to set super-low loss-making prices and undercut competition -- something the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission confirmed earlier this month was allowed under competition laws.

Amazon's first Australian distribution centre in Dandenong, Melbourne.

While Amazon's roll-out in Australia is expected to be slow, it will be wide-reaching.

Amazon is no longer just an e-commerce website.

The $US500 billion company has diverged into delivery services, fresh food, banking, television streaming and checkout-free grocery stores. It is in fierce competition with Google over voice controlled technology with its home assistant, Alexa, and now looks set to take on Ticketmaster for the sale of event tickets.

It's latest ventures have also seen it increasingly roll out bricks-and-mortar stores.

In America, almost half (43 percent) of online sales now go through Amazon -- a figure which continues to grow. It's also the country's eighth largest employer.

In Germany and the United Kingdom, the company now sells more non-perishable goods than any other retailer.

Retail analyst Paul Broadfoot believes Amazon will put huge pressure on Australian businesses and see stores close across Australia.

"When was the last time we went to a Video Ezy or Blockbuster? We don't go to them any more. All our Australian book retailers went through bankruptcy -- so we've got a bit of history to predict what will happen if we just put our head in the sand," he told HuffPost Australia.

Big or small, decisions aren't as easy as they may seem.

Psychologists have found decision-making is fraught with hidden influences, tricky nuances, and the ability to make us happy in the short-term but unhappy in the long-term.

Some of my greatest insights into this aspect of human behavior have come from TED talks, which break down research findings into their most digestible form.

Here are the talks that have changed how I make decisions.

Philosopher Ruth Chang's 2013 talk explains that people often struggle to choose between two equally good options that are "on a par."

People tend to view hard choices as burdens, but Chang would prefer we see them as blessings that grant us agency. Hard choices make us confront our desire to live in the city over the country, for example, or to eat a healthy breakfast over sugary cereal.

The takeaway: Whenever I face a hard choice, I celebrate it as a way to cement an aspect of my identity.

"Grit: The power of passion and perseverance"

In 2013, UPenn psychologist Angela Duckworth presented the findings of her research on grit - or the ability to keep trucking when life gets hard.

Duckworth has found across numerous fields that grit is the single-biggest indicator of personal and professional success, even more than IQ. And the best way to cultivate grit is to build a "growth mindset" that sees circumstances are flexible, not rigid.

The takeaway: The moment when things start getting tough is the starting point for success, not a sign to call it quits.

"The paradox of choice"

In Barry Schwartz's 2005 talk, the Swarthmore College psychologist reviews research that says people are misled in thinking they should want as much choice as possible, whether it's the number of salad dressings at the supermarket or clothing styles at the mall.

It's actually possible to get worn out from making so many tiny choices throughout the day. It's called decision fatigue, and it can detract from the many important choices you need to make, whether at home or at work.

The takeaway: I limit my number of choices on purpose, because I know I'll be happier with my decision once I make it.

"Are we in control of our own decisions?"

Behavioral economist Dan Ariely gave a talk in 2009 that suggests outside forces quietly nudge people toward certain outcomes over others.

A famous example is organ donation. Some countries have far higher rates simply because the form people fill out is opt-out, and people generally stick with the default option.

The takeaway: I do my best to take will power out of the equation by making the default option the healthiest, such as not buying junk food at the store rather than avoiding it in my cabinet every day.

"The surprising habits of original thinkers"

UPenn psychologist Adam Grant remarked in 2016 that some of history's most original thinkers organized their time in interesting ways to achieve maximum creativity.

Specifically, Grant says people should put off their projects for a bit so they can let disparate ideas congeal into something original. It's not quite procrastination, because it's intentional, but it comes close.

The takeaway: If I want to solve a creative problem, the decision to leave and come back to it really does pay off.

"The riddle of experience vs. memory"

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman spoke in 2010 about the two ways we find happiness: in the moment and in our memories. People must keep each in mind when trying to create happiness.

For example, according to Kahneman's research, the experiencing self is twice as happy on a two-week vacation over a one-week vacation, but the remembering self isn't, since no new memories are being formed.

The takeaway: I can make more intentional choices in the service of both selves, in order to maximize each kind of happiness.

"The optimism bias" by Tali Sharot

Sharot, a cognitive scientist, explains in her 2012 talk that roughly 80% of people succumb to what's known as an "optimism bias," or the tendency to see themselves and loved ones as better than they really.

Importantly, she's found in her research that high expectations are a good thing, in part because anticipation makes people happy. It's the reason it's thrilling to make vacation plans and why Fridays, a work day, are more enjoyable than Sundays, a weekend.

The takeaway: I make big plans further ahead of time, knowing the event itself isn't the whole picture. The anticipation is part of what makes me happy.2

It Might Be Your VaginaEver noticed when you take your black underwear out of the washing machine, there is a ‘bleach’ stain in the crotch area? Well, you have your vagina to thank. That’s right, women’s bits can reportedly have the same corrosive, colour-changing properties as the chemicals we use to clean our toilets. Not caused by menstruation or lack of cleanliness, this ‘bleached’ area - which often appears orange or bright white in colour - is similar to what happens if you spill small amounts of bleach on clothing. Still unconvinced you would have gone your whole life without knowing this if it is the case? You aren’t the only one.

kinda messed up how no one ever tells u that ur vagina might bleach ur underwear November 18, 2017

But Emma Soos, managing director at The Women’s Health Clinic confirms that our vaginas are totally capable of doing this (even if it seems shocking). “It can cause a reaction, and stain, in different types of underwear,” says Soos. So how does our vagina do this? In short, this is all about acidic discharge. The pH balance in the vagina is acidic - a healthy value is somewhere in the range between 3.8 and 4.5 - to stop bad things happening down there. The NHS says: “Bacteria called lactobacilli help keep the vagina’s pH balance at its normal low level, which prevents the growth of other organisms. “If the pH of the vagina increases – it gets less acidic – the quality or amount of lactobacilli can fall and other bacteria can multiply.” And because, unlike male genitalia, the vagina is a self-cleaning machine, it produces discharge that has the same acidic qualities. Dr Vanessa Mackay, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, says: “This mucus is produced naturally from the neck of the womb, known as the cervix. “The amount of vaginal discharge varies throughout a women’s menstrual cycle, and most pregnant women will get a pregnancy discharge.” And then this acidic discharge ends up on our knickers when we wear them.-1
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/23/despite-blue-laws-customers-line-up-for-black-friday-deals.htmlDespite 'blue laws,' customers line up for Black Friday dealsMassachusetts might be one of three states that don’t let stores open on Thanksgiving but it hasn’t stopped some shoppers from camping outside this year in anticipation of Black Friday deals.

So-called ‘‘blue laws’’ prohibit big box stores and other retailers from opening their doors until Friday. Neighboring Maine and Rhode Island have similar restrictions.

But to 26-year-old Melvin Hernandez, it doesn’t matter. He’s already lined up to snag a spot outside a Best Buy store in Watertown, Mass.

The maintenance technician told The Associated Press he was set on snagging a heavily discounted 50-inch TV, and also had his eye on an Xbox One.

Business groups have long said the laws are unnecessary barriers during an era of 24-hour online retailers, but some shoppers, workers and even retailers say they appreciate one day free of holiday shopping.

Blue laws were once widespread throughout the country and are thought to date back to Colonial times, although some of the current regulations in Maine were instituted in the 1960s. The name may be derived from an 18th-century usage of blue meaning "rigidly moral," according to the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

The rules vary among the states. Retailers smaller than 5,000 square feet can operate in Maine, for example.

Thanksgiving and Christmas are the main holidays affected in all three states, but in Massachusetts, blue laws also prohibit stores from opening on the mornings of Columbus and Veterans Day without state permission. Easter and New Year's Day are also sometimes included.

But for the stores that are open, retailers are courting customers to shop. About 69 percent of Americans, or 164 million people, intend to shop at some point during the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation trade group.

Black Friday is expected to remain the busiest day with about 115 million people expected to shop.

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/Record-October-for-new-condo-apartment-sales-as-single-family-inventory-remains-low-1009282718Record October for new condo apartment sales as single-family inventory remains lowGREATER TORONTO, Nov. 23, 2017 /CNW/ - New construction home sales soared in the GTA in the month of October, primarily driven by sales of multi-family homes, condo apartments in high-rise and mid-rise buildings and stacked townhomes, the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD) announced today.

There were 5,377 new homes sold in October, according to Altus Group, BILD's official source for new-home market intelligence. About 91 per cent of them (4,884 units) were multi-family homes, and only nine per cent (493) were low-rise single-family homes such as detached and semi-detached houses and townhomes. Condo sales for October were 81 per cent above the 10 year average of 2,697, and the highest October yet recorded, while low-rise sales were 64 per cent below the 10 year average of 1,388.

As of the end of October, 39,476 new homes have been sold in the GTA in 2017, 82 per cent of them condo apartments in high-rise and mid-rise buildings and stacked townhomes.

"October data shows that the new homebuyer is left with very little choice when it comes to purchasing a new home," says BILD President and CEO Bryan Tuckey.

"Provincial intensification policy has our members building more high and mid-rise dwellings making housing choices a challenge. The cost of a single family home is out of reach for many consumers pushing them to buy a condo over a house. As a result we are seeing record breaking condo sales and higher prices this year for new low-rise homes."

While supply of new housing increased again in October and reached 12,500 units, it is still well below what is considered a healthy level. Supply of new housing is typically measured by the number of new homes available for purchase in builders' inventories at the end of the month. At the end of October, there were 9,308 multi-family homes and 3,192 single-family homes available in the GTA.

"Demand for newly-built condominium apartments is being fueled by three key buyer groups – small investors who have become the de facto providers of new rental housing supply in the GTA; end user buyers who might prefer a single-family home but are seeking out more affordable options; and the more traditional end users who value the lifestyle and amenities of well-located projects," said Patricia Arsenault, Altus Group's Executive Vice President of Research Consulting Services.

Prices of available new homes in October increased slightly for both single-family low-rise homes and multi-family homes. The average for available new single-family homes was $1,217,428 up from $1,204,829 in September, and 29.8 per cent above last October's average price of $937,689. The average price for available new detached homes was $1,548,888 and the average for available new townhomes was $995,571.

Meanwhile the average price of available new condo apartments in high-rise and mid-rise buildings and stacked townhomes was $677,456 in October, up from September's $661,188. The average price per square foot was $791 and the average unit size was 857 square feet.

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/OPSEU-to-file-Charter-challenge-over-college-back-to-work-law-1009281738OPSEU to file Charter challenge over college back-to-work lawTORONTO, Nov. 23, 2017 /CNW/ - The Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) is challenging the Ontario government's latest back-to-work legislation in court.

The province ended a five-week strike by Ontario college faculty November 20 by passing Bill 178, the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Labour Dispute Resolution Act, 2017, on November 19. OPSEU President Warren (Smokey) Thomas says the law violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically Section 2 (d), which protects freedom of association.

"For over a decade, the Supreme Court of Canada has viewed collective bargaining as a protected right under the Charter," Thomas said. "More recently, the court has extended that protection to the right to strike.

"In the case of the colleges, the provincial government had the power to direct the employer to make the moves necessary to bargain a settlement," he said. "The government chose legislation instead. They trampled on the right to collective bargaining when they clearly had other choices."

On November 16, hours after 86 per cent of college faculty had rejected the colleges' contract offer, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne met with both sides and gave them three hours to settle the strike.

"The government never gave collective bargaining an honest chance after the contract was rejected," Thomas said. "That three-hour deadline was a sham designed to provide legal cover for legislation that was already a foregone conclusion. Instead of directing the colleges to settle, the government let them walk away from the table, then came back with a hammer."

The colleges are Crown agencies that receive nearly half their overall funding from the provincial budget and are in no way independent from government, Thomas said. The government has the power to direct the colleges to take specific actions any time it chooses to do so, he added.

News of the Charter challenge was met with thunderous applause at the Ontario Federation of Labour convention in Toronto this afternoon.

Thomas said it was "ironic, but not funny" that the government had passed Bill 148, which improves certain labour standards, "just a few days after it had walked all over the Charter rights of more than 12,000 workers."

Bill 178 gave OPSEU and the colleges 90 days to settle the current contract dispute at arbitration.

http://www.businessinsider.com/ted-talks-how-to-make-decisions-2017-3These 7 TED talks have completely changed how I make decisionsBig or small, decisions aren't as easy as they may seem. Psychologists have found decision-making is fraught with hidden influences, tricky nuances, and the ability to make us happy in the short-term but unhappy in the long-term. Some of my greatest insights into this aspect of human behavior have come from TED talks, which break down research findings into their most digestible form. Here are the talks that have changed how I make decisions. View As: One Page Slides

(Source: SelfWealth)

Melbourne fintech SelfWealth has floated on the Australian Securities Exchange, raising $7.34 million through an initial public offering.

Based on the $0.20 IPO price, the company has a market capitalisation of $26 million.

SelfWealth operates a share-trading platform that allows users to buy and sell any volume of shares for a flat fee of $9.50 per transaction. No monthly fees are charged, although an optional $20 “premium” tier is available for deeper market analysis and access to a “social investment network”.

The company did not disclose current customer numbers, but founder and managing director Andrew Ward in last year revealed the platform had 3,000 self-managed superannuation fund clients plus 2,500 direct users.

“It is an audacious goal, but within the next 12 months we are hoping to have 100,000 online trading accounts,” Ward said at the time.

SelfWealth raked in $137,000 of revenue for the 2017 financial year, while posting a loss of just over $9.8 million.

Ward, who is a former Commonwealth Bank private wealth director, said that since the startup’s establishment in 2012, he has seen “a shift away from bank- and broker-owned platforms”.

“In our view, the next generation of investors want to work with independents, and ultimately hold control over their own portfolio. And that’s what we give them.”

He added that the capital raised from the IPO would be used to expand its user base, further develop the platform and create new products. The company also stated its marketing and advertising budgets would be “tripled” using the new cash.

“We are excited by the interest and support shown from investors and are delighted to officially list on the ASX,” said Ward.

The company stated earlier this month that it had more than 400 existing investors, and addressed criticisms from some of them that the IPO was premature.

“A lot of people may say that we’re floating a little early. But when we started the process of commercialising the business towards the end of last year, one in five people asked us ‘who is Selfwealth and are you a viable business? If I give you my money and start trading, will you be around?’,” Ward told Fairfax Media earlier this month.

Reaching the 100,000 user target would give the fintech a 15% share of the roughly 700,000-strong online trader market in Australia.

“Then we will have CommSec in our sights,” Ward said last year.

“Banks are also charging too much [for broking], and to me percentage broking fees seemed wrong and immoral. I thought there had to be better way do it.”

Kate McClure, 27, started the Gofundme.com campaign earlier this month after she said she ran out of gas on Interstate 95 and a homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., walked a few blocks and bought her some with his last $20.

McClure said she didn’t have any money to repay him at the time but returned to the road several times to give him cash, clothes and food.

After a few visits, she started the fundraiser with the hopes of using the money toward housing and other expenses for the 34-year-old Bobbitt.

“I wish that I could do more for this selfless man, who went out of his way just to help me that day,” she wrote on the fundraising page. “Truly believe that all Johnny needs is one little break. Hopefully with your help I can be the one to give it to him.”

Donations have poured in, and the fundraiser has shattered its initial goal of raising $10,000 for Bobbitt. More than 8,400 people had given to the campaign by Thursday afternoon.2
http://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb3zzy/donald-trump-sure-does-like-to-talk-about-how-invisible-f-35-fighter-jets-areDonald Trump Sure Does Like to Talk About How ‘Invisible’ F-35 Fighter Jets AreCaption: Left, Donald Trump (Facebook). Right, artist interpretation of an F-35 (Wikipedia).

Have you ever seen Stealth, that movie from 2005 with a 13 percent Rotten Tomatoes score?

That one with Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx who play fighter pilots that have to, I dunno, beat up Sam Shepard who stole a jet with a cloaking device or something? No, alright, that’s all cool, not very many people other than me have. OK, have you ever seen Wonder Woman? No, not the classy movie that just came out! The freakin’ comic, where she has the invisible jet! How about Star Trek with those Klingon Bird of Prey that go invisible when someone yells ‘So'wI yIchu'?’

No? Jesus Christ, you gotta catch up on your invisible military technology pop culture, friend.

Anyhoo, I’m not here to talk about bad movies from my youth or comics and TV shows from the 60s. The reason we’re here, is because Donald Trump, took a break from fanning the ever growing flames of rage in his country and headed down to Riviera Beach in Florida to address the Coast Guard and talk about invisible fighter jets.

So for the second time in recent months, Trump kinda hinted that he thinks that F-35s are invisible. Look, Buzzfeed has the full transcription of his speech here, but what we’re going to break down here is this bit of it. Here’s Donald, is his own words.

“The Navy, I can tell you, we're ordering ships, with the Air Force i can tell you we're ordering a lot of planes, in particular the F-35 fighter jet, which is like almost like an invisible fighter. I was asking the Air Force guys, I said, how good is this plane? They said, well, sir, you can't see it.’ I said ‘but in a fight. You know, in a fight, like I watch on the movies. The fight, they're fighting. How good is this?’ They say, well, ‘it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it.’ Even if it's right next to them, it can't see it. I said that helps. That's a good thing.”

To be fair, it might just be a bit of rhetoric from Trump, surely the Commander-in-Chief knows that while yes, it is small for a fighter jet and tough to spot on radar—the super-duper expensive F-35 is quite visible to the human eye. Especially when it’s “right next to them.”

But this is your president America,—you’re lucky he didn’t get in the cockpit and just go "VROOSH VROOSH" for ten minutes.

The second biggest takeaway from this speech was Trump really likes the way dogfights look in the movies (honestly, who doesn’t, shout out to Iron Eagle). That’s good because it’s unlikely he’ll be watching the F-35 in a movie-style dogfight anytime soon (it’s yet to even fly a combat mission for the US)—given that dogfights have basically faded into military history.

Anyway, as mentioned above, THIS ISN’T EVEN THE FIRST TIME THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD INDICATED HE THINKS PLANES CAN BE INVISIBLE and you know what they say, fool me once, shame on you, etc, etc. So, Trump thinking that his military has invisible planes—it’s a pattern. Take a look for yourself:

“So amazing we are ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the Air Force, especially the F-35. You like the F-35? ... You can't see it,” he said in October. “You literally can't see it. It's hard to fight a plane you can't see."



“That’s a pretty cool piece of tech you got there, toots.” - Donald J. Trump (presumably)

Now, this isn’t to say some sort of cloaking technology couldn’t happen, scientists have been working on it for years, but—what I can tell you here—is that it is, most certainly, not currently used on F-35s.



My best guess is that someone once told America’s president that F-35 were invisible to radar (they’re not) and that just rattled around in the melting collection of well-done steak and ketchup clogged neurons inside his brain, and came out the other side that they’re actually invisible.

Next stop: convincing Trump that the Marines need to take out Cobra.

Especially if that turkey happens to be barbecue and grilling expert Adam Perry Lang's smoked turkey breast.

The thing about this smoked turkey breast is that it defeats the Achilles' heel of pretty much every turkey every cooked: blandness.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/coffee-could-lower-the-risk-of-heart-failure-and-stroke-heres-how-2017-11Coffee could lower the risk of heart failure and stroke -- here's howiStock

A recent headline in the Australian newspaper claimed “A short black a day can keep heart attack at bay”:

American scientists have unearthed fresh evidence that coffee exerts protective effects against heart failure and stroke.

According to the researchers, for every extra cup of coffee drunk per week, there was a 7% reduction in risk of heart failure and an 8% risk reduction for stroke.

So, is this more good news for coffee lovers, or a case of be careful what you read?

As the researchers explain in the media article:

We don’t know if it’s the coffee, compounds in the coffee or behaviour associated with drinking coffee.

The data comes from observational studies showing an association between coffee consumption, and heart failure and stroke. It does not prove causation. It shows that people who drank more coffee had lower rates of heart failure and stroke, not that drinking more coffee was responsible for reducing this risk.

There may be other reasons why people with heart failure and those who have had a stroke drink less coffee, for example, being on fluid restrictions for medical reasons, or not being able to move independently enough to make a cup of coffee.

That doesn’t mean you should avoid having another cup of coffee. A review of 20 observational studies from 2014 found those who drank the most coffee had longer life expectancies than those who drank the least or no coffee.

Again, these studies showed correlation not causation, but the evidence to suggest coffee is good for you is mounting.

How was the research conducted?

This story came from an abstract of a presentation to the American Heart Association’s 2017 Scientific Sessions on November 14. The researchers used data from more than 12,000 adults in the Framingham Heart Study to look for eating and drinking habits associated with heart disease.

The study used a powerful new statistical approach called random forest machine-learning methods. This uses all the individuals’ data to construct multiple decision trees and work out what the common patterns are when predicting their health outcomes. The researchers said this technique was a bit like the algorithms used in the marketing programs that predict our shopping behaviours.

The researchers confirmed that high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and older age increased the risk of heart disease. They also identified that higher intakes of coffee predicted a lower risk of heart failure and stroke.

Lastly, the researchers created a statistical model that included the well-documented heart disease risk factors – age, sex, total and HDL (good) blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes – that are used to calculate a person’s Framingham Risk Score. This is a person’s ten-year probability of developing cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart failure and atherosclerosis (fatty deposits that clog arteries).

This analysis found that including coffee consumption in the equation improved the accuracy of the Framingham Risk Score in predicting heart failure and stroke by 4%.

The researchers reported finding similar trends – the 7% reduction in risk of heart failure and 8% risk reduction for stroke – in two separate studies.

What does this mean?

The study in the media headline was not about heart attack, it looked at heart failure and stroke, which are very different conditions:

Heart attack is triggered by short-term lack of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle causing some muscle cells to die

is triggered by short-term lack of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle causing some muscle cells to die Heart failure means the heart can’t pump blood around the body adequately

means the heart can’t pump blood around the body adequately Stroke is when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted by either a blockage or a burst blood vessel.

This difference is important because while something might be good for the heart muscle itself, it’s not necessarily good for the blood vessels in the heart and brain.

The data was from a conference abstract only. So it includes very limited details of the methods and results, and misses important information such as:

which variables were adjusted for in the statistical analyses (external factors that might skew the results)

how coffee intake was assessed

whether decaffeinated coffee was included, and

exactly how much was consumed each day or over the week.

While it’s great to hear about early research findings, the data has not gone through the full peer review publication process and so we will have to wait to eventually read the full paper.

Most importantly, this data comes from observational studies and shows an association between coffee consumption and heart health. It does not prove causation.

So is coffee good for your health?

If you are a smoker, it’s wise to avoid regular coffee. A review of the best evidence found a higher risk of lung cancer for smokers who drank regular coffee, although drinking decaffeinated coffee was suggestive of a lower risk.

Among those with high blood pressure, caffeine in coffee does lead to an immediate increase in blood pressure that can last a few hours. However, there is no evidence of an overall higher risk of heart disease.

For a host of other reasons including a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and a longer life expectancy, drinking coffee is now on the list of things to consider to improve your overall health. – Clare Collins

Blind peer review

This is a fair and accurate assessment, and accords with the data from two studies published this year on death from any cause (and heart disease and stroke). –Ian Musgrave

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/png-police-have-moved-in-to-evict-refugees-from-the-former-manus-island-detention-centre-2017-11PNG police have moved in to evict refugees from the former Manus Island detention centrePapua New Guinea police in the Manus compound. (Source: ManusAlert via Telegram)

Papua New Guinea authorities moved into the former Manus Island detention centre early this morning, three weeks after the centre was closed by the government, in a bid to move on around 400 men who remained at onsite, despite the power and water being cut off.

Iranian-Kurdish refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani is among several refugees tweeting from the centre as the operation got underway today.

He says police and immigration officers entered the camp shortly before 7am shouting that people had an hour to leave. Some of the detainees climbed onto the roof of one of the buildings. Others claimed the authorities were being agressive and threatening but PNG police told Fairfax Media that they would not being using force to evict the refugees.

But one of the men says they are being beaten and forced onto buses by police and immigration.

They are beating guys, and putting them by force on buses and trucks.

They have big big rods and sticks in hands. Police and Immigration both are doing it together #ManusSOS — Walid Zazai (@ZazaiWalid) November 23, 2017

Boochani claimed an Australian Federal Police officer was there guiding around 50 PNG mobile squad police, but the AFP subsequently said “it has no member within the former Manus Regional Processing Centre and no involvement in today’s actions. An AFP liaison officer is in Manus Province working in an advisory and mentoring capacity to the RPNGC on policing matters”.

The police, special forces, police squad are now in their hundreds, spreading through the prison camp and around the prison. Navy soldiers are outside the prison camp. We are on high alert right now. We are under attack. — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017

We are blockading right now. So many police and immigration officers are around us at this moment. They destroyed everything and our belongings and right now are shouting at us to leave the prison camp. I am tweeting from a toilet right now. — Behrouz Boochani (@BehrouzBoochani) November 22, 2017

Fellow detainee Walid Zazai subsequently tweeted a photo he says shows Boochani being arrested and taken away.

Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton told a Sydney radio station 2GB the government was “very keen” for people to leave the centre.

“I think it’s outrageous that people are still there and they have trashed the facility, they are living in squalor, and the Australian taxpayers have paid about $10 million for a new facility and we want people to move,” he said.

The PNG government closed the centre, which reopened in 2012 under a deal with the former Australian Labor government to process asylum seekers who attempted to reach Australia by boat, on October 31 this year following a PNG Supreme Court ruling that it was illegal and in breach of the country’s constitution.

The centre has been without power and water since it was decommissioned and around 380 of the 600 men there when it closed have refused to leave. This week the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said a humanitarian crisis was developing as a result and called on the Australian government to accept responsibility and act.

The UNHCR said the $10 million facility referred to by Dutton is not ready to accept the detainees.

The Australian government says how refugees and asylum seekers are dealt with on Manus is an issue for PNG.

PNG police have denied destroying belongings, but say they have emptied rainwater tanks on site over concerns about disease.

New Zealand has offered to take some of the refugees from Manus, but the Australian government refused the offer with Dutton arguing it would encourage people smugglers.

Australia has a deal with the former Obama administration for the US to accept genuine refugees from Manus Island and Nauru. So far 54 have been resettled while another 500 await assessment of their status.

This morning 12 former Australians of the Year published an open letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling on the government to act over the “human disaster” at the centre.

“We should not withhold water from people, nor withhold food; we should not leave seriously ill people to die without medication and treatment,” they wrote.

“We are also concerned about Australia’s international reputation in human rights. It seems that both our major political parties have failed to meet their most basic obligations under the United Nations Refugee Convention, one that our country helped to negotiate and which we signed in 1951.”

The signatories to the letter are Ita Buttrose, Rosie Batty, Simon McKeon, Patrick McGorry, Mick Dodson, Tim Flannery, Fiona Wood, Fiona Stanley, Gustav Nossal, Peter Doherty, John Yu and Robert de Castella.

While the detainees occupying the centre had been active on social media posting photos and video, several hours on, Zazai claims the group was surrounded and anyone caught filming was being beaten.

We can't take pictures or video.

Whole area surrounded by them.

When they see anyone filming they catch him, beat him and take him. #SaveUS#ManusSOS — Walid Zazai (@ZazaiWalid) November 23, 2017

Labor’s shadow immigration spokesperson Shayne Neumann said the Prime Minister had a “moral obligation” to guarantee the ongoing safety and security of the detainees.

“It’s time Turnbull showed some leadership and immediately secured other third country resettlement options for eligible refugees, including accepting New Zealand’s offer and negotiating appropriate conditions,” he said.

Immigration minister Peter Dutton said the men will not come to Australia.

Prime minister Turnbull said the refugees should obey the law and authorities and move, but the government “will not be pressured” into accepting them.

“Our border security, the integrity of our borders is maintained by my government and we will not outsource our migration policy to people smugglers,” he said.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/oak-park-mom-honors-future-saint-over-childbirth-miracle/Oak Park mom honors future saint over childbirth ‘miracle’Oak Park mom honors future saint over childbirth ‘miracle’

Camela Daley, left, poses for a photo with her son Solanus in Camela's home Monday, Nov. 20, 2017, in Oak Park, Illinois. Tim Boyle/For the Sun-Times

Camela Daley, 50, believes a miracle — through the “intercession” of late friar Solanus Casey, who recently took an important step toward sainthood — saved the life of her newborn son a decade ago. The boy, named for Casey and now in fourth grade, attended the friar’s “beatification” ceremony with Daley this month.

“I’m a mom of seven . . . a music director at a parish, and I am just a very busy mom, pretty ordinary life . . . my faith is very important to me, and my family.”

***

Solanus Casey was a Capuchin Franciscan friar, “born in Wisconsin on a farm,” one of 16 children.

After becoming a priest, Casey moved to Detroit, “started a soup kitchen there and . . . just lived among the poor,” and worked as a doorkeeper at a monastery.

“His two loves were the poor and the sick,” and he “was known for his simplicity, humility and just living in God’s will, really, he was known for listening, that’s where his greatness came from . . . he just listened and through that they felt important and just special.”

He died in 1957.

***

In Catholicism, there are steps to formal sainthood, and last weekend Casey was “beatified,” the last step before being “canonized” or officially declared a saint.

There was a ceremony at Detroit’s Ford Field that reportedly drew 60,000.

Catholics and some other Christian traditions don’t worship saints – who are considered “very close to God” – but they might enlist them as a sort of “conduit” to God, working as “a friend to help you to have your prayers answered.”

***

A couple of years before Daley’s son was born, a friend “introduced” her to Casey’s story, and she watched a video of him.

“He reminded me of my grandfather, who was a farmer in Wisconsin,” where Daley is from.

“I just loved the life that” Casey lived, “the simplicity of him, and he was so accessible . . . you could emulate . . . we could all strive for that kind of sanctity.”

Daley’s husband came to appreciate Casey, too, and even suggested while Daley was pregnant that their child, if a boy, should be named after Casey.

Daley wasn’t sold, though.

***

While pregnant in 2007 she didn’t feel right one day.

She got home and “hemorrhaged.”

The bleeding stopped by the time she arrived at the hospital, but when the doctor broke her water, things turned worse. Later it was determined the placenta “had detached early.”

“The doctor just yelled to me, ‘Camela you need to push now, now.’”

“I was calling upon the Holy Spirit at the time, and I remember three pushes, the third push, huge push, he was out.”

The baby, a boy, had lost a lot of blood.

“Couple of little sounds he makes and then all of a sudden he gets real pale, and they run over to him and start rushing him away, one of the doctors starts doing CPR, manipulating the heart . . . they go into a room, shut the shades . . . chaplain walks in, and she’s shaking her head, preparing to me.”

***

“I started to pray to Solanus Casey, into my mind came his face and his words . . . ‘Blessed be God in all His designs.’ . . . And I had this, it was amazing, this peace came over me, that I can’t even explain, it was, all I can say is being absorbed in God’s will.”

“I was in another dimension.” She looked at her distraught husband and said, “Whatever happens, it’s OK.”

“I looked at him then again and I said, ‘And if he makes it, his name will be Solanus,’” with Casey as the middle name.

***

From her hospital bed, she called a friend to let her know what was going on, but ended up in voicemail. On it her friend had recorded a quote from Casey: “God’s will, nothing more, nothing less, nothing else.”

“It was just confirmation after confirmation that this man was there with me, right there,” and the baby.

***

The baby had a blood transfusion, was rushed to another hospital.

“They said he probably won’t make it and even if he did . . . he might be . . . not functioning very well.”

But days later, the critical-care doctors said, “We don’t see anything wrong, and we don’t really know why, I guess the hospital did a really good job.”

But the other physicians “both called it a miracle, they couldn’t believe it.”

“Of course, we knew what had happened . . . that Solanus Casey had interceded for us, this miracle that God performed through this humble friar to save our son, I’m positive this was a witness of God’s mercy in wanting Solanus Casey to be known in these times.”

Other miracles have been attributed to him, including one that helped lead to his beatification.

***

Daley’s son “came out of it with no repercussions, just a . . . regular, happy . . . perfect 10-year-old child.”

***

Since then Daley has spread the word about Casey, handing out his prayer cards and sharing her family’s story with friends.

Initially she thought she was unable to attend the Nov. 18 beatification ceremony in Detroit. She didn’t have a ride, a place to stay or tickets.

But through friends, and friends of friends, things fell into place, and she and her son, now in 4th grade, ended up making it – another miracle, according to Daley.

***

“Pray works, absolutely it works.”

“There are so many miracles all around, I think it’s important that people share their stories . . . so that everybody can see that these things do happen, and have hope.”

By Fabian Cambero

SANTIAGO, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Chilean state copper company Codelco said on Thursday it produced slightly less copper from January to September 2017 than it did in the same period a year ago but rebounded from a year-earlier loss as prices for the metal improved.

Codelco Chief Executive Nelson Pizarro said the company produced 1.24 million tonnes of copper in the January-to-September period, a 3 percent decline from the same period last year.

He added the company posted more than $1.6 billion in pretax profit for the first nine months of 2017 versus an $18 million pretax loss in the year-earlier period.

Direct cash costs through September rose to $1.32 per pound of copper from $1.27 in 2016 as declining ore grades - a problem in Chile for years - continued to take their toll.

Codelco, which transfers all its profits to the state and relies on capitalization and some debt issuance to fund its operations, is emerging from a prolonged rough patch after a collapse in copper prices in 2016 ate into earnings and scuttled near-term investment plans.

The price of copper has risen dramatically in recent months on strong Chinese demand and supply disruptions, among other issues. Codelco, like other copper miners, is reinstating projects that were earlier put on ice. {nL1N1KX15S}

At a news conference announcing the results, Pizarro said the state miner was in a strong position for 2018 following the refinancing of billions of dollars in debt earlier this year.

"Today, we are comfortable as we look forward to the coming year, knowing that it will not be necessary to tap debt markets," Pizarro said.

Codelco, which ships about two-thirds of its copper to Asia, was the world's top copper producer based on its annual output to June 2017, according to rating agency Moody's.

The company says it plans to invest $4 billion annually to revamp its aging mines, expand abroad and keep output flowing. (Reporting by Fabian Cambero; Writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Peter Cooney)-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/greg-barns/should-australias-counter-terrorism-laws-cost-us-our-civil-liberties_a_23286015/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageShould Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws Cost Us Our Civil Liberties?July 29, 2017: A policeman refuses to let members of the public walk onto a Sydney street that has been blocked to the public after a counter-terrorism raid.

When it comes to terrorists, who needs civil liberties? They're out to get us and we need every power we can get to protect ourselves. It's them versus us, and we're going to win. Right?

These are the some of the questions that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is currently grappling with as it undertakes a review of counter-terrorism laws. Specifically, it is considering whether we should retain laws that many see as dangerously broad and offending the rule of law, in case they might assist us in the fight against terrorism.

The laws in question, which allow the use of control orders, preventative detention without charge or trial and warrantless searches of private property, were all introduced in 2005 following the horrific terrorist bombings in London that left more than 50 people dead and many hundreds injured.

Law-makers agreed that we could not allow such a thing to happen in Australia. Since the laws were introduced, control orders have been used six times. Preventative detention has never been used federally, and just a handful of times at the state level. No warrantless search has ever been conducted.

As he introduced the reforms, the then-Attorney General Philip Ruddock explained that the powers would ensure that "the toughest laws possible to prosecute those responsible should a terrorist attack occur" were available. He added that "we are in the strongest position possible to prevent new and emerging threats, to stop terrorists carrying out their intended acts". Laudable ambitions, no doubt.

However, the proposed means of implementing these aims was not without controversy. The inquiry at the time received nearly 300 submissions, many of which expressed concern about the way that these laws would undermine fundamental rights that had existed for centuries.

These concerns have continued to be expressed in the intervening years, with many arguing that the powers go too far in undermining civil liberties without any proof that they indeed make us safer. Which is, after all, the name of the game.

The Council of Australian Governments, for example, recommended for the repeal of preventative detention orders, that significant additional safeguards be implemented around control orders, and for greater judicial oversight of search powers in 2013.

The former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC, recommended repealing control orders and preventative detention orders, replacing the former with continuing detention orders available only for people who had already been convicted of terrorist offences. He noted that there "is no demonstrated necessity for these extraordinary powers", and that established powers of investigation, arrest and detention were adequate to protect national security.

The UN Human Rights Committee has expressed concern at the lack of response to these recommendations by COAG and the INSLM, recommending that all limitations on human rights for national security purposes be strictly necessary and proportionate, and subject to appropriate safeguards.

These are well-respected experts in the field of counter-terrorism, and they are concerned that these extraordinary powers do not increase our safety from terrorist attacks in any way.

Alarmingly, some legislators in this country think that what they call 'civil liberties' are a luxury that can be easily dispensed with when it suits. The Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, for example, recently suggested that people in his position did not have the luxury of considering civil liberties.

Mr Andrews and his fellow leaders at COAG thought there was nothing untoward about legislation to expand preventative detention to children as young as 10. The ease with which our legislators strip away fundamental rights and protections, even for primary school children suspected of no wrongdoing, is genuinely frightening.

International experts make it clear that civil liberties, human rights and counter-terrorism laws in fact can exist in perfect harmony. The UN itself has said, in its global counter-terrorism strategy, that protecting human rights is an intrinsic part both of protecting ourselves against terrorism and eliminating the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.

The first UN expert on counter-terrorism and human rights, Professor Martin Scheinin, made it clear that balancing human rights and security is not necessary.

"The proper balance can and must be found within human rights law itself. Law is the balance, not a weight to be measured."

Counter-terrorism laws, after all, seek to protect the most precious human right of all: the right to life. When people defend civil liberties and human rights, it is not because they do not defend the right to life. It is, rather, because all rights are best protected in harmony.

Protecting human rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary detention, in fact enhances our ability to defend ourselves against terrorism. The international instruments that have recently codified these ancient rights make it clear that these rights can be limited, to the extent that it is 'necessary'and 'proportionate' to any threat to national security.

However, when existing police powers are adequate to investigate, detain and punish terrorists, it is hard to argue that the laws that do away with fundamental rights, and have defined our civilisations for centuries, meet this threshold. Their lack of use, after our security forces have foiled numerous threats, indicates that there is no need to sacrifice rights for security.

This is not just theory. Doing away with fundamental rights in the name of security is dangerous. In the 1970s, the UK interned hundreds of suspected IRA supporters in an effort to quell the civil war in Northern Ireland. However, in the following months, conflict increased dramatically.

Ultimately, it was admitted that this preventative detention generated greater support for the IRA. Rather than keeping the population safe from violence as promised, the policy stoked community divisions. In that case, when it came to terrorists, doing away with civil liberties caused greater bloodshed. We ignore that lesson at our peril.

The Parliamentary Committee is continuing to accept late submissions as a part of its review of these laws.0

("Acceleware" or the "Company") (TSX-V: AXE), a leading developer of high performance seismic imaging applications and RF heating technology, today announced results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 (all figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted).

During the three months ended September 30, 2017 (Q3 2017), Acceleware continued to invest in RF heating research and development. After a successful 1/20 scale field test, activities were focused on preparation for a commercial-scale test of the RF XL technology. Development activities included filing one new patent application, preparation of five additional potential patent applications, and working with service companies on proprietary well and well pad designs. On November 3, 2017, the Company announced that it had been awarded $10 million in financing for the commercial-scale test from Sustainable Development Technology Canada and Emissions Reduction Alberta. The funding is conditional on securing a suitable oil sands partner and test site. In addition to the funding announcement and technology development activities, the Company also made progress in the identification of an oil sands partner and the selection of a commercial-scale test site. Acceleware has been in discussions with three potential oil sands operating partners, and several simulations were conducted of potential oil sands test sites using the Company's AxHeat software. Acceleware generated revenue in its RF heating segment through the sale of AxHeat in the three months ended September 30, 2017 (Q3 2017). The Company's software and services business experienced a challenging oil and gas market in Q3 2017, with decreased software product revenue compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 (Q3 2016), however a slight rebound was recorded compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017 (Q2 2017). Software maintenance, particularly seismic imaging software increased in Q3 2017 compared to both Q2 2017 and Q3 2016. Software consulting services revenue decreased significantly in Q3 2017 compared to both Q3 2016, and Q2 2017 due to decreased training revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, revenue was lower than for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower product revenue and despite higher maintenance and consulting revenue.

During the three months ended September 30, 2017, Acceleware recognized revenue of $237,576 - 35% lower than the $366,675 recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease is a result of lower software product and software services revenue. Revenue in Q3 2017 also decreased 24% compared to the $312,612 recorded in Q2 2017 due to lower software product and software services revenue including notably lower consulting services for training. On a segmented basis, the Company recorded $20,700 in RF heating revenue in Q3 2017 compared to no revenue in either Q3 2016 or Q2 2017. Software and services revenue was 41% lower at $216,876 in Q3 2017 compared to $366,675 in Q3 2016, due in large part to decreased services revenue including training. Software and services revenue was also 31% lower in Q3 2017 compared to $312,612 in Q2 2017 again due to lower training services revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 revenue decreased 14% to $1,048,377 from $1,219,530 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower seismic imaging product revenue.

The Company had total comprehensive loss for Q3 2017 of $913,738, an increase of 181% compared to a total comprehensive loss of $324,722 for Q3 2016. The higher total comprehensive loss is a result of higher research and development (R&D) investment, higher general and administrative (G&A) expenses in the RF heating business, and lower revenue in the software and services business, combined with a significant loss on derivative instruments associated with the Company's convertible debentures. Total comprehensive loss increased 43% in Q3 2017 to $913,738 compared to $641,197 in Q2 2017, due to lower revenue and the loss on derivatives (the Company recorded a gain on derivative instruments in Q2 2017).

For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 total comprehensive loss was $2,003,794, an increase of 90% compared to a loss of $1,056,272 recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is a result of greater investment in research and development (R&D) and higher general and administrative (G&A) expenses, and higher finance expense (accrued interest and accretion) associated with convertible debentures.

On a segmented basis, loss from operations attributed to the RF heating segment was 39% higher in Q3 2017 at $537,838 compared to $385,802 in Q3 2016, due to higher investment in R&D and higher G&A expense. Operating loss for RF heating was 26% lower in Q3 2017 compared to the loss of $753,686 recorded in Q2 2017 due to lower R&D and G&A expenses. Operating income attributed to software and services decreased to a loss of $136,436 in Q3 2017, compared to income of $79,434 in Q3 2016 due to lower revenue, higher investment in R&D, and higher G&A expense. Software and services operating loss was also lower in Q3 2017 compared to the loss of $23,107 recorded in Q2 2017 due to lower revenue.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, RF heating operating loss increased 43% to $1,684,016 from $1,176,754 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to higher R&D investment, higher G&A expense related to stock based compensation, and despite higher revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 software and services operating loss was $145,930 compared to operating income of $192,282 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to lower seismic product revenue.

Cash flow used in operating activities increased 502% to $721,543 in Q3 2017 compared to $256,971 in Q3 2016 due to the loss and a higher investment in working capital. Cash flow used in operations was also significantly higher in Q3 2017 compared to Q2 2017, rising 623% from $99,769 due to increased investment in working capital. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017 cash used in operations was significantly higher at $1,684,306 compared to $491,825 used in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase is a result of increased loss and higher investment in working capital.

At September 30, 2017, Acceleware had $1,058,126 (December 31, 2016 - $1,616,415) in working capital, including $1,094,132 (December 31, 2016 - $1,922,318) in cash and cash equivalents, and $61,046 (December 31, 2016 - $58,095) in combined short-term and long-term debt in the form of finance leases. On September 26, 2017, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement consisting of 4,651,066 units at a price of $0.18 per unit for gross proceeds of $837,192, and proceeds net of issue costs of $823,486. Each unit consisted of one common share and one-half common share purchase warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase an additional common share of the Company at a price of $0.27 per common share for a period of two years. At September 30, 2017, the Company had $998,175 (December 31, 2016 - $928,800) (principal plus accrued interest) in convertible debentures that accrue interest at 10% per year. The decrease in cash (and consequently working capital) is a result of the comprehensive loss incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and an increased investment in working capital, offset by the proceeds from the private placement. The increase in working capital other than cash is a result of the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities such as deferred salaries and other payroll liabilities. On November 17, 2017, the Company forced conversion of the convertible debentures, exercising the option to convert all outstanding principal and accrued interest into 6,762,014 units of one common share of the Company plus ½ common share purchase warrant.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/malcolm-turnbull-manus-island-2017-11Malcolm Turnbull 'won't be pressured' on Manus IslandWalid Zazai/ Twitter

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he “won’t be pressured” by the Manus Island standoff, which has reached its 24th day.

On Thursday, police stormed the camp, three weeks after the centre was closed by the government, in a bid to move on around 400 men who remained at onsite, despite the power and water being cut off.

Some men were escorted from the site on buses but most of the refugees and asylum seekers remain at the decommissioned facility, refusing to leave.

Turnbull said the men refusing to leave were perhaps trying to pressure the government into letting them live in Australia, but their tactics won’t prevail

“I will just say that the people at the Manus Regional Processing Centre, which has been closed by the PNG authorities should leave and go to the alternative accommodation that has been provided,” he said.

“They’re staying there is obviously designed – they think this is some way they can pressure the Australian Government to let them come to Australia.

“Well, we will not be pressured.

“I want to be very clear about this – our border security, the integrity of our borders, is maintained by my government. It is maintained by my government and we will not outsource our migration policy to people smugglers.”

Iranian-Kurdish refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani is among several refugees reported escorted to the new location.

Some men said they were beaten and forced onto buses by police and immigration.

They are beating guys, and putting them by force on buses and trucks.

They have big big rods and sticks in hands. Police and Immigration both are doing it together #ManusSOS — Walid Zazai (@ZazaiWalid) November 23, 2017

The Australian government says how refugees and asylum seekers are dealt with on Manus is an issue for PNG.

“The PNG authorities are acting in accordance with the directions of their government in accordance with their law,” said Turnbull.

“The people on Manus should go to the alternative places of safety with all of the facilities they need.

“They should do so peacefully and they should do so in accordance with the lawful directions of Papua New Guinea”.

The Manus Island regional processing centre was closed by the Papua New Guinea government last month after a 2016 ruling by the PNG Supreme Court that the facility was illegal and in breach of the constitution.

New Zealand has offered to take some of the refugees from Manus, but the Australian government refused the offer arguing it would encourage people smugglers.

The US has accepted 54 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru following a deal with the Obama administration to resettle them there. Another 500 are still awaiting assessment.

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/23/man-convicted-1978-california-double-murder-pardoned-after-dna-test.htmlMan convicted of 1978 California double murder pardoned after DNA testA 70-year-old California man convicted nearly four decades ago of killing his ex-girlfriend and her 4-year-old son walked out of prison Wednesday after DNA tests showed he was wrongfully convicted.

Gov. Jerry Brown pardoned Craig Richard Coley and ordered his immediate release from a state prison in Lancaster.

Coley has maintained his innocence since he was arrested on the same day 24-year-old Rhonda Wicht and her 4-year-old son, Donald Wicht, were found dead in her Simi Valley apartment on Nov. 11, 1978.

Brown wrote in his pardon that Coley has been a model inmate for 38 years, avoided gangs and violence, and dedicated himself to religion.

"The grace with which Mr. Coley has endured this lengthy and unjust incarceration is extraordinary," Brown wrote.

Coley's request for clemency was supported by Simi Valley Police Chief David Livingstone and Ventura County District Attorney Gregory Totten, who said they cannot stand by the evidence used to convict Coley.

"As district attorney, I must tell you I look forward to the day when I can shake Mr. Coley's hand, apologize to him for the injustice he suffered," Totten said at a news conference Monday, a video of which was posted online by the Ventura County Star.

"I am also hopeful that one day soon we will bring to justice the violent man responsible for this most horrific crime," Totten said.

Rhonda Wicht was strangled, apparently with a macrame rope, and her son was suffocated. Investigators quickly zeroed in on Coley, who had broken up with Wicht shortly before she was killed.

Coley's first trial in 1979 resulted in a hung jury, with jurors unable to resolve an impasse that left them 10-2 in favor of guilt, according to a news release issued by the police chief and district attorney.

He was tried again in 1980, found guilty and sentenced to life without parole.

Brown said he asked the state parole board to look into Coley's conviction more than two years ago, and former law-enforcement officials said they believed he was wrongfully convicted or framed.

Livingstone and Totten said they began reviewing the case last year after a retired detective raised concerns about Coley's guilt. The trial court had ordered evidence destroyed after Coley exhausted his appeals, but investigators retrieved records from Coley's relatives and located biological samples at a private lab.

Using advanced techniques not available at the time of his trial, technicians did not find Coley's DNA on one key piece of evidence used in the conviction, but they did find DNA from other people, whom authorities have not publicly identified.

"This case is tragic," Livingstone and Totten wrote in their news release. "An innocent woman and small child were murdered. Craig Coley has spent 39 years in custody for a crime he likely did not commit."-1
http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/Environmental-and-Energy-Consumption-Footprint-of-Vanadiumcorp-Electrochem-Process-Technology-1009285678Environmental and Energy Consumption Footprint of Vanadiumcorp-Electrochem Process TechnologyVANCOUVER, Nov. 23, 2017 /CNW/ -

VanadiumCorp Resource Inc. (TSX-V: "VRB") (the "Company") is pleased to announce that it is publishing the results of Environmental Footprint and Energy Consumption Analysis and Comparison of The Vanadiumcorp-Electrochem jointly owned patent pending technology in addressing the recovery of vanadium from vanadiferous feedstocks. Furthermore, VanadiumCorp-Electrochem Process Technology combined with Electrochem Technologies & Materials Inc. ("Electrochem") patented iron electrowinning process focuses on the recovery and monetization of the iron metal values representing up to 65% of the feed in the particular case of titanomagnetite (VTM, magnetite) of various origins and in lesser extent the titania and silica values.

Adriaan Bakker, CEO of VanadiumCorp states, "85% of vanadium is derived from very few magnetite resources in the world with limited recovery, high cost and a large carbon foot print. Conversely, the new carbon free, high efficiency approach from VanadiumCorp-Electrochem represents maximum transformation of all value add products and vanadium electrolyte direct from ground source. The current mandate continues to assess global licensing opportunities representing potential cash flow and accelerated validation ahead of further patent and resource developments.

According to the World Steel Association in 2016, the worldwide steel production currently totals about 1.6 billion tonnes per year. The prevailing Blast furnace process produces pig iron from iron ore using carbon as reductant; the process releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Production of a tonne of steel generates 1.8 tonnes of CO 2 emissions, according to steel industry figures, accounting for as much as 5 percent of the world's total greenhouse-gas emissions. The industry has met little success in its search for carbon-free methods of manufacturing steel. Steelmaking is one of the world's leading industrial sources of greenhouse gases.

VanadiumCorp and Electrochem have developed a new chemical technology solution in early 2017 that can be both adapted and integrated into current steel and vanadium operations and constructed as a standalone facility to monetize all value add products of various feedstocks, carbon free energy, maximum recovery into high purity products.

Among the two conventional processing routes used industrially, only the smelting/slagging and roasting processes such as those formerly performed by Highveld in the republic of South Africa and New Zealand Steel in New Zealand were addressing the particular issue of full iron recovery. They did produce pig iron containing 1.25 mass percent vanadium first by smelting/slagging that was then converted into steel by injecting oxygen into the molten metal yielding a secondary vanadium-rich slag containing 12-24 mass percent V 2 O 5 from which vanadium pentoxide was finally extracted by soda ash roasting and hot water leaching.

However, the energy consumed during the smelting and slagging steps together with the CO2 emissions are rather significant. To our knowledge no detailed life cycle analysis studies are available in the public domain regarding specifically the vanadium industry, however it is still possible to have access to reliable data regarding iron and steel making processes such as those published in: Fruehan, R.J.; , Fortoni, O.; Paxton, H.W.; and Brindle, R. (2000) - Theoretical Minimum Energies To Produce Steel for Selected Conditions. - Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

From the report, the actual specific energy consumption for producing a steel slab by smelting, steelmaking and hot rolling is on average 22.95 GJ per tonne of steel slab (6.380 MWh/tonne) while the GHGs emission is on average 1.8 tonne of CO2 per tonne of steel. This latter figure must be compared with 1 tonne of CO2 emitted during the production of one tonne of cement.

These numbers confirm the strong negative environmental impact of extracting vanadium pyrometallurgically using the iron and steelmaking route. These numbers do not take into account the specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to the soda ash roasting part of the process. In another report to the USGS [Bleiwas, D.I. (2011)] - Estimates of electricity requirements for the recovery of mineral commodities, with examples applied to sub-Saharan Africa. – US Geological Survey (USGS), Open-file Report 2011-1253, Reston, VA]: the specific electricity consumption for the production of vanadium pentoxide from pig iron is assessed as 3.000 MWh/tonne. This specific consumption was estimated based on limited data addressing the blowing of pig iron to produce vanadium pentoxide products and it includes crushing, grinding, and one or more of the following: roast-leach, rotary-kiln, electric-smelting, shaking-ladle, and basic-oxygen-furnace operations.

This should preclude implementation of new smelter capacities especially in jurisdictions were stringent environmental regulations were put in place as most governments agreed worldwide to reduce GHGs by implementing strict CO2 emissions reduction policies. Moreover, public acceptance towards implementing polluting technologies are at all time low while the trend is to promote green and cost-effective alternatives.

For all these reasons, integrating vertically the carbon and energy free VanadiumCorp-Electrochem chemical technology for vanadium, copperas, titania and silica recovery with Electrochem's patented electrochemical technology offers a unique competitive alternative to ironmaking by replacing the carbon reductant with electricity. Specific energy consumption during iron electrowinning can be as low as 2.900 MWh/tonne of electrolytic iron when operating under certain conditions (Canadian Patent CA 2,717,887 C) while the very low CO 2 emissions would be linked to minor ancillary operations such as steam generation and drying. The various specific energy consumptions for each operation unit used in the integrated process are currently accounted from the flow sheet under assessment at the prototype level during Phase II. These data will be refined further during scale-up that will ensure more reliable data to be used as benchmark and for comparison purposes.

In conclusion, the two integrated technologies will be able to offer a highly cost effective and greener alternative to smelting and roasting in jurisdictions having access to affordable electricity either from hydro or nuclear power.

VanadiumCorp has a simple vision with global implications for many vanadium-titanium-iron resources, with a green process to benefit vanadium batteries for a sustainable future. To facilitate these objectives, the Company is developing new carbon free process technology with Electrochem in tandem with development of the Company's 100% owned, vanadium resources in Quebec Canada.

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/HUB-Montreal-2017-Review-of-the-1st-edition-1009285675HUB Montreal 2017 - Review of the 1st editionMission accomplished: the concept is a success!



MONTREAL, Nov. 23, 2017 /CNW Telbec/ - From November 8 to 18, HUB Montréal rallied the dynamism of its cultural and creative industries and laid the foundation of a major event offering, positioning November as yet another highlight of the Montreal calendar by focusing on creative business tourism!

In total, no less than 25,000 spectators and 1,000 professionals from more than 20 countries participated in these 11 days of activities, through 9 partnered events, bolstered by the contributions from more than 50 public and private partners. All responded to HUB Montréal's invitation to unite the efforts of Montreal's creative and entrepreneurial community to woo foreign buyers, decision-makers and investors while creating an event accessible to Montrealers who are curious to discover new forms of artistic expression in the digital age.

"It is with a joyful mix of pride and gratitude that we watch the curtain drop on this prototype edition. The challenge was indeed tremendous but the timing, impeccable. Witnessing such a large diversity of creative ecosystems converge in the HUB confirms the relevance of this initiative and hints at a future as fascinating as it is promising. Thank you to all those who believed and contributed directly or indirectly to the success of this 1st edition!" -Sebastien Nasra, founder and producer of HUB Montreal.

In this, our city's 375th Anniversary, HUB Montreal will also have reached its goal of showcasing more than 30 Montreal companies, creative studios and artists in five creative sectors including video games, multimedia, music, digital arts and special effects.

"The Society for the Celebrations of Montréal's 375th Anniversary views this industrial hub as one of the engines of our economy. As precursors, we are happy to have supported the creation of this event, which will take root in the years to come. In this first edition, HUB Montreal has shown great leadership and know-how in developing high quality content that will only improve over the next few years." - Alain Gignac, General Manager, Society for the Celebrations of Montréal's 375th Anniversary

The Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal (CCMM), the Conseil des arts de Montréal (CAM), Lune Rouge, the Guilde des développeurs de jeux vidéo indépendants du Québec, the Quartier des Spectacles Partnership (PQDS), the Phi Centre, Mutek and MTLàTABLE are among the players who collaborated in the presentation of HUB Montreal activities, contributing to a rich and well-received programming for the 350 participants registered for the HUB PRO segment. The latter also welcomed, in the context of its 28 trans-disciplinary panels and conferences, showcases and networking events, several hundred participants registered for partner events: the Relevent Conference, Doc Circuit Montréal (DCM), the Atelier Grand Nord in virtual reality, the Montreal Virtual Reality Market (MVRM), RPM's JAMX360, Mundial Montreal and M for Montreal.

The "Revolution" and "Revelation" showcases at HUB PRO offered an impressive array of creators and local creative companies such as Felix & Paul Studios, Moment Factory, GSM Project, 45 Degrees and Rodeo FX. By way of this programming, participants and visitors could discover the talent via the showcases, and experience it immersively through activities like Your VR in my RV, the MVRM at the SAT, the architectural projections at the Place de la Paix and the presentation of prototypes of "augmented musical performance", the fruits of a 48-hour collaborative laboratory orchestrated by the RPM in collaboration with M for Montreal.

HUB Montréal also enabled inter-sectorial meetings between professionals, international delegates and representatives of "Montreal Inc." at cutting-edge networking events that have (finally) desegregated the various creative silos. Its "speed-meeting" allowed HUB Pro participants to meet leaders in the field of VR and video games, while the networking dinner mentored by the CCMM was an unforgettable moment of convergence between 140 guests from business, creative industries and high-profile influencers from across the globe.

The Soirée Composite and its digital creation projects, which closed HUB Pro, attracted nearly two hundred participants. They all entered via the red tunnel that led them into the room where the presentations were held, followed by a cocktail party. This was a fantastic foray into the Lune Rouge Creative Hub, where impending construction will soon revive and repurpose the now-defunct Maison Alcan.

"The goal of the Lune Rouge Creative Hub is to foster the emergence of creative and entrepreneurial projects which promote the development and effervescence of Montreal. As such, it was only natural that we join this project and we are delighted to have contributed to the first edition of HUB Montreal, which was brilliantly executed by an experienced and imaginative team. "

Nadine Gelly -Executive Director, Lune Rouge

See you in 2018

The showcases presented this year suggest only good things for the second edition, coming in November 2018. They have proven that Montreal and Quebec are brimming with creative talent and that our task is simply to have it recognized locally and to launch it into foreign markets.

HUB Montreal also hopes to continue the conversation with other potential partners, particularly in the field of publishing. It seeks to fulfill its mandate to champion the local creative potential and consolidate our creative offer so that November becomes an international rendezvous not to be missed. The annual recurrence of an event such as HUB Montreal will contribute to Montreal's positioning as a prized destination for business tourism, and as an international leader in the creative industries.

HUB Montreal, presented by LUNE ROUGE, is conceived by Antenne créative (a non-profit organization responsible for managing the event). It is produced by Avalanche Prod and is made possible thanks to the support of the Society for the Celebrations of Montréal's 375th Anniversary and the participation of the Government of Quebec, the City of Montreal, Tourism Montreal, the Canada Media Fund and the Conseil des arts de Montréal. The Casino de Montréal supports the HUB FEST component and Audiokinetic is associated with HUB PRO.

Written by AP Technology Writer, BARBARA ORTUTAY published on November 22, 2017 - 12:42 PM

Share this:

(AP) — Facebook says it will show users if they followed or ‘liked’ Russia propaganda accounts on its service or on Instagram.

The company said Wednesday it will launch a portal to let people see which accounts of the Internet Research Agency they followed between January 2015 and August 2017. The tool will be available by the end of the year. But it won’t show users if they merely saw — or even “liked” — posts from those pages.

Facebook, Google and Twitter testified before Congress this month, acknowledging that agents tied to the Russian government used their platforms to try to meddle with the U.S. elections. Facebook has said that as many as 150 million Facebook and Instagram users may have seen ads from the Internet Research Agency.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, called the move a “very positive step” in a statement. But emphasized that he’s still looking for more, including a joint report by the companies “on how Russia used these platforms to sow discord and influence the election.”

The companies were initially dismissive of Russia’s threat, but they all pledged to make improvements amid pressure from lawmakers.

Still, Facebook so far hasn’t said it will show people if they were targeted by Russia-paid political advertisements, or even if this is something it is able to do.-1
https://thebusinessjournal.com/top-california-state-lawmaker-wont-run-amid-allegations/Top California state lawmaker won't run amid allegationsShare this:

(AP) — Democratic Assemblyman Raul Bocanegra, the focus of mounting sexual harassment allegations, said Monday he won’t seek re-election next year but some party leaders are pressuring him to immediately step down.

The two-term lawmaker from Los Angeles is the first political casualty since sexual harassment allegations became a hot-button topic in the capital last month.

Bocanegra’s announcement came after a weekend when members of the California Democratic Party’s executive board called on him to resign and hours before the Los Angeles Times reported six more women have accused him of inappropriate behavior including groping and kissing.

Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, a Bell Gardens Democrat and co-chair of the Legislative Women’s Caucus, said Bocanegra should step down immediately.

“Don’t wait till 2018. Leave now,” Garcia wrote on Twitter. It’s troubling that Bocanegra is deciding his fate on his own terms, she said.

“He shouldn’t be the one driving this discussion about what happens with him,” she said.

Amar Shergill, a Democratic Party board member started a petition seeking his immediate resignation and that of Democratic Sen. Tony Mendoza, who faces an investigation into his behavior toward several young women who worked for him. Mendoza, of Artesia, has not commented on the call to step down and has denied any wrongdoing.

The state party has taken no formal position.

Democrats would temporarily lose their legislative supermajorities if the two stepped down, but the party would almost certainly win both seats back in special elections because of strength in those districts.

Bocanegra issued a statement on Facebook announcing his intent to step down next year.

“As you may know, news stories were reported a few weeks ago about a regrettable encounter when I was a legislative staffer in 2009,” he said.

“It was a moment that I truly regret, that I am very sorry for, and for which I have accepted responsibility for my actions.”

“These news reports have since fueled persistent rumors and speculation, and I do not believe that this is in the best interest of my constituents to continue to serve next term,” he wrote.

Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, who last year appointed Bocanegra majority whip where he’s tasked with rounding up votes for the Democratic leadership, did not call on Bocanegra to resign. However, he said if the allegations are verified by investigators he will push to remove Bocanegra from office.

Rendon also announced Bocanegra would be out as majority whip, though hours earlier Bocanegra said he’d leave the job.

“The decision to deny constituents the representation of their elected official can be a difficult one, but make no mistake: If the investigation affirms the allegations, I will move to immediately expel Mr. Bocanegra from the Assembly,” Rendon said.

Allegations against Bocanegra first came to light last month, when legislative staff member Elise Gyore said she had reported him to Assembly investigators in 2009, when both were staff members, after he stalked her around a nightclub and put his hands down her blouse at an after-work event. He was told to stay away from her but not otherwise disciplined by the Assembly Rules Committee.

The allegations described to the Times by six women span from 2009 to 2014, when Bocanegra was a staff member, candidate for office and elected lawmaker. They include instances of kissing and groping, as well as repeated solicitations for dates.

None of the women reported Bocanegra’s behavior to the Assembly at the time, but Jennifer Borobia has since filed a complaint, the Times reported. The two both worked for former Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes.

Over a several year period starting in 2009, Bocanegra repeatedly asked her on dates through text messages and emails, even after she rejected him, she told the Times.

“These allegations are extremely disturbing, especially since they come after Mr. Bocanegra had previously been investigated and disciplined as a staff member and agreed to stop any harassing or abusive behavior,” Rendon said of the Times’ story.-1
https://thebusinessjournal.com/interest-rates-rise-banks-paying-deposits/As interest rates rise, banks are paying more for deposits

Written by AP Business Writer, KEN SWEET published on November 22, 2017 - 12:33 PM

(AP) — Slowly, but surely, being a saver is paying off again.

For years after the recession, banks paid next to nothing on deposits — much to the detriment of savers everywhere. Now, banks have increased lending and need more deposits, so they’re willing to pay higher interest rates.

The big publicly traded banks are paying roughly 0.40 percent on their deposits right now, which is up from 0.24 percent two years ago, according to an October report from Autonomous Research after the major banks reported their quarterly results.

A one year CD is now paying an average of 0.63 percent, which is up from 0.45 percent two years ago. That’s according to depositaccounts.com, a website that tracks interest rates on savings accounts and CDs.

An interest rate of 0.40 percent or 0.63 percent may not sound like much, but analysts expect that banks will continue to increase payouts on deposits as competition ramps up.

“We have been waiting for this to happen for a while now,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economy analyst at BankRate.com.

During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to near zero, and kept it that way until December 2015. While the Fed’s move made the cost of borrowing substantially cheaper nationwide, it had a secondary effect of cutting the interest rate banks were paying on deposits. In particular, seniors got hit hard since they tend to keep their money in low risk products like money markets, CDs and cash.

The Fed’s main interest rate is now 1.25 percent, and is expected to be raised to 1.5 percent the Fed’s December meeting. As the Fed raised rates, banks initially were happy to charge borrowers higher rates while keeping the amount of interest they were paying on savings accounts and CDs low.

Banks take on deposits in order to turn around and lend that money out. The goal for a bank is to make more money on the interest on its loans than the interest rate they are paying to fund those loans.

The more demand there is for loans, which typically happens in a steadily growing economy, the more deposits a bank needs.

For years after the financial crisis, loan growth was tepid as banks throttled back on lending, the U.S. consumer deleveraged and businesses pulled back on borrowing as well. Bank executives said they had little need for deposits. In an interview with The Associated Press in early 2016, then-US Bank CEO Richard Davis said there was no reason to incentivize people to deposit money at the bank since there was nothing the bank could do with the money in the first place.

But nearly a decade after the crisis, loans of all types — with the exception of residential mortgages — are now at record-high levels. And the growing demand for loans requires banks to gather up deposits to fuel their lending business.

The online-only banks, which typically pay the most for deposits, are paying even more these days. Goldman Sachs’ online savings account GS Bank pays an interest rate of 1.29 percent on its savings account, with no minimum deposit. For those able to lock up their savings for a longer period of time, GS Bank is paying 2.37 percent for a five-year CD, with a minimum $500 deposit.

Goldman is partially using its new deposits to fund a new consumer lending product known as Marcus, which is causing Goldman to be more aggressive with its interest rates in order to fund those loans.

Ally Bank is paying 1.25 percent for deposits to its online savings account. So is American Express, through its Personal Savings account.

The largest of the banks are still being stingy, however, because their size means they don’t need to compete as aggressively for deposits. JPMorgan Chase is paying only 0.04 percent on a standard savings account, Bank of America is paying 0.03 percent and Wells Fargo, apparently with zero need for deposits, is paying 0.01 percent on a basic savings account.

All three banks have CDs with slightly higher rates, but savers looking to maximize the interest they’ll earn on parking their money should shop around.0
http://www.newrepublic.com/minutes/145954/congresss-reckoning-sexual-harassment-just-beginningCongress’s reckoning with sexual harassment is just beginning.On August 9, 1969, the New Republic’s editor in chief Win McCormack was partying with four of his friends in Santa Barbara, California. Earlier that day, reports of a strange and grisly murder had filled the news, the details now famous: the Bel-Air mansion, the pregnant wife of a renowned director stabbed to death, the word “pig” written out in the victim’s blood. As dusk fell, one of McCormack’s friends dove into a fear-driven fantasy of the murders, imagining that they would be the next victims.

Nearly five decades later, Charles Manson is dead at 83 of natural causes. He died in a hospital, serving a life sentence without parole. His legacy is of entrapping young middle-class women in his cult, and directing them to commit high-profile murders in California. He wanted Helter Skelter, a new world order, to culminate in cataclysm.

In the mid-1980s, McCormack spoke with a former member of the Manson clan, referred to here as “Juanita,” who managed to escape the cult shortly before it orchestrated the murders. In Juanita’s eyes, Manson was both the devil and a reincarnation of Jesus Christ. To Manson himself, there was no difference between the two.

Juanita: [Charles Manson] was not particularly big—probably five-two. Really wiry, real agile. Almost leprechaunish in some ways, with a quick wit. There was a real playful quality about him, an endearing quality about him. He could be very much the little boy, and he showed a vulnerable side that really got you engaged in taking care of him.

Win McCormack: How did he show his vulnerable side?

J: I remember one time—this was at Spahn’s [Movie Ranch near Los Angeles] and it was even very possibly that same night I gave him all my money. There were kittens all over the place. The mother cat had stopped cleaning up after them. They had messed in the kitchen. And Charlie got down on his hands and knees and cleaned the kitchen floor. He cleaned up after the kittens. He picked them up and put them inside his shirt and went and sat by the fire and warmed the kittens and played mother cat. I remember him looking up and saying, “I now understand the pain of too much tenderness, because it hurts not to hug them. But if I were to hug them I would hurt them.” It was those kinds of things. He showed himself or acted like a very, very gentle man that would never hurt anything.

WM: You say you gave him all your money?

J: It was amazing how quickly Charlie read me. He seemed to know all the right buttons to push. Within a month I’d signed over my camper and something like a sixteen-thousand-dollar trust fund, which in 1968 wasn’t small potatoes.

WM: How did he get you to do that?

J: That’s a question I’ve asked myself many times. Some of it was drug-induced, I’m sure. I can remember the night that I told him he could have the money. That day, we started early dropping acid and doing all those kinds of wonderful things. He had been telling me that the thing that stood between me and total peace of mind and heart was Daddy’s money—I was not going to be free of Daddy until I got free of Daddy’s money. Charlie started [saying] that I was my father’s ego. And I remember thinking, That doesn’t make any sense to me. Then later I convinced myself that it probably was [right], because Charlie was always right. Charlie never openly said that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, but if he didn’t say it, he sure to hell implied it. He would say things about having flashbacks about having the nails driven in through his wrists. He said, “The nails weren’t put in my palms, they were put into my wrists.” And, “They always lie to us. Everything’s 180 degrees from the way they told you it was. And there is no difference between Jesus and the devil.”

WM: What if you’d been there? What if you hadn’t been deprogrammed? Do you think that you would have been involved in the murders?

J: My fear is that if I were there I’d be in jail now too. Because I pretty well did whatever he told me to do. I mean, for me to walk forty miles, as I did one time—I had blisters on the soles of my feet that were two and a half inches in diameter ... because Charlie wanted me to go somewhere and I didn’t have a car, so I walked. The basic programming was that you had to die to be freed anyway, so death was not something to be afraid of. That we were all members of one greater consciousness. But the other thing was that if Charlie said, “Jump,” my only question would be: “How high?-1

Locals say assassins often use this back entrance to sneak into the port in Metro Manila’s Navotas, since the front gate is manned 24 hours a day by armed security guards.

A puddle of blood marks the spot where masked assassins gunned down Francisco Remedillo, a 68-year-old barbecue vendor, and Marlon Dela Cruz, his 36-year-old adopted son, in their little house in Metro Manila’s Quezon City. Dela Cruz was the intended target of the raid. But when Remedillo attempted to intervene, armed with a bat, he, too, was shot dead next to the only bed in their home.



Manuel Borbe’s blood runs into a storm drain after he was killed by unidentified masked men on motorcycles in the Holy Spirit district of Quezon City. According to his sister, Vivian, Borbe dealt drugs, but not by choice; he was forced into the drug trade to support his addiction to methampetamines, known locally as shabu.0
http://www.newrepublic.com/article/145952/toxic-chemical-industry-really-great-yearThe Toxic Chemical Industry Is Having a Really Great YearThe scariest part about the 2014 chemical spill in West Virginia was that, in the beginning, no one really knew anything about the chemical that poisoned their drinking water. Ten thousand gallons of a licorice-scented chemical called MCHM had leaked from a storage container into the Elk River, a tap water source for 300,000 people in Charleston. Schools closed, hospitals evacuated patients, and the local economy of the state’s most populated city came grinding to a halt. For weeks, citizens were unsure whether they had been exposed to unsafe levels of the chemical, and what exactly MCHM would do to their bodies if they consumed it.

West Virginians did eventually get a clearer picture of MCHM. Tom Burke, who served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s chief science adviser under President Obama, thinks that’s partially because of an EPA program called the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which assesses the health risks of thousands of chemicals across the country. “When there is a mystery like West Virginia, it’s those world-class scientists in the IRIS program that do the exposure assessment and risk analysis that lead to future decision-making about the chemical,” he told me. Congress is well aware of its value. “From the dusts of the World Trade Center and the faucets of Flint; to the toxic waters of Katrina and Harvey; [IRIS scientists] are there, working selflessly to protect our nation’s environment and public health,” Burke said in September before a House Science Committee hearing on the program. “Our health depends on them.”

We may not be able to depend on them for much longer. On Monday, the Republican-controlled Senate released a spending bill that eliminates IRIS. The bill asserts that IRIS’s functions would be maintained, just transferred to the agency’s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) program. But Burke and others say the TSCA program is not large or well-funded enough to handle all the different types of chemical risk assessments IRIS does. “EPA’s ability to conduct risk evaluations under the new TSCA would be severely curtailed by the loss of both expertise and capacity that reside in the IRIS program,” wrote Richard Denison, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.

But this is good news for companies that produce and disseminate chemicals. IRIS scientists’ findings have huge financial implications for polluters. When chemicals get into the air, soil, or water, regulators often base their cleanup requirements on what IRIS scientists say is safe. And chemical industry–funded scientists have been recently accusing the program of misconduct, claiming IRIS scientists exaggerate the health risks of certain chemicals. (One asserted that formaldehyde is not carcinogenic when inhaled.) A recent report also found that the IRIS program was operating more efficiently and more transparently than ever. That will surely cease being the case if the program is transferred to TSCA.-1
http://www.newrepublic.com/article/145951/book-reactionary-timesA Book for Reactionary TimesRobin’s new edition leaves Trump for the end, and builds inexorably up to his presidency through a combination of old material and newer essays. Burke’s theory of value and Nietzsche’s influence on the Austrian school of economics make up the other two new additions. This arrangement is still prone to some of the flaws of the original; it can be sweeping in places. But it remains a keen and necessary book, one that informs our understanding of Trump’s particular grandiosities. Robin’s second edition ties Burke’s conviction that the market, and the “monied men” who control it, should determine value to Nietzsche’s passionate attachment to the idea of an aristocratic, cultural taste-making class and both, eventually, to Trump.

Burke scorned both the Levellers and the French Revolution, mostly for the same reason: They wanted to overthrow an order that he wanted to preserve. His theories of value were central to defining and defending that order. Robin credits Burke with arguing both that value is “subjective,” and that there is an objective “hierarchy of value that divides and distinguishes rich from poor, capital from labor.” Similarly, Nietzsche later feared that the demands of workers presented serious threats to his sense of order, writing that they would tear “down the walls of culture.” In this he resembles not only the ideals of the Austrian school but that of contemporary conservatives, who frequently speak of the dignity of work and the glories of free enterprise as though both comprise some intrinsic cultural facet of American national identity. When they praise “liberty,” and defend America’s role in defending it, this is what they mean. Conservatives may praise the worker when it is time to win Wisconsin’s electoral votes, but when they are in power we see who they really admire, and that is the CEO. If workers were able to determine their own value, they would hardly occupy such a low position.

At the core of the conservative tradition is the defense of the stratification of society into upper and lower classes. Conservatives do not all justify this stratification in the same way, or communicate it in the same terms. Some, like Palin, conceive of it as a religious order. Others prefer pure Randian narcissism. But they share a belief in hierarchy, and an opposition to egalitarianism. Most call it liberty, and a few probably believe that they are telling the truth. Beneath this, their populism is a marketing gimmick. It’s meant to lull us, to sell us something.

And so we have Trump, salesman-in-chief. He has “revised” the conservative script, Robin argues, but his most virulent qualities do not subvert it at all. “The racism of the Trumpist right is nastier than its most recent predecessors,” he writes. “But the weaponization of racism and nativism under Trump is an intensification of a well-established tradition on the right, as studies of American conservatism from the 1920s through the Tea Party have shown.” Strom Thurmond and Lee Atwater might be dead, but their party hasn’t turned away from white supremacy. The war on drugs, hardline immigration policies, the privatization of public schools, the weakening of organized labor: Republican policies still disproportionately target people of color and reinforce the injustices previously visited on them by slavery, Jim Crow and violent, organized groups. Trump’s racism is only a more open expression of older beliefs. So is the manner in which he politicizes his own wealth.

Trump is not especially well-versed in the history of conservative ideas, as Robin allows in the book. But Trump’s ascent shows that one need not be conversant with the conservative tradition in order to take an important place in it. Trump’s canny callbacks to Reagan require only instinctive revanchism; he doesn’t need to seriously consider any political questions in order to invoke the Gipper and reap the adulation of college Republicans in all fifty states. Nor is his celebration of wealth out of step with conservative norms. Where he presents a challenge to conservatives, it is because he puts forward what Robin calls “competing visions of the market.”0
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42073417Charlie Rose: CBS sacks talk show host over harassment claimsImage copyright Reuters Image caption Charlie Rose, 75, is one of America's most respected broadcasters

US TV host Charlie Rose has been fired by CBS News following sexual harassment allegations.

An email to staff said the presenter's employment had been "terminated... effective immediately".

It said the move followed the revelation of "extremely disturbing and intolerable behaviour" said to have taken place around his programme.

Eight women accused the veteran TV interviewer of inappropriate behaviour in a report by the Washington Post.

Following the allegations he was suspended by CBS, PBS and Bloomberg. Rose co-hosted the CBS This Morning show and was a correspondent for its Sunday night news magazine 60 Minutes. He appeared on PBS and Bloomberg with the Charlie Rose show.

Rose apologised following the Washington Post story, but said not all the claims were accurate.

The allegations span from the 1990s to 2011 and include groping, lewd telephone calls and unwanted advances.

The internal email to staff from CBS News president David Rhodes read: "Despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organisation, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace - a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work. We need to be such a place.

"I've often heard that things used to be different. And no-one may be able to correct the past. But what may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable."

Rose, 75, is one of America's most respected broadcasters and his interviews have won him Emmy and Peabody awards. He was named by Time magazine as one of its 100 most influential people in 2014.

He is known for conducting in-depth interviews, including with such high-profile guests as former President Barack Obama, talk show host Oprah Winfrey and billionaire Warren Buffett, on his eponymous television programme which first aired in 1991.

In recent weeks, numerous high-profile figures, including Oscar-winning actors and a Hollywood filmmaker, have been accused of sexual harassment.

The accusations were sparked by multiple women speaking out against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and a subsequent campaign encouraging victims to share their stories of sexual harassment under the #metoo hashtag.-1
https://www.clickorlando.com/news/tree-supporting-ksc-s-famous-bald-eagle-nest-has-diedTree supporting KSC's famous bald eagle nest has diedTwo bald eagles are seen in their nest near State Road 3 in this 2005 NASA file photo.

BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. - Nestled in a famous pine tree at Kennedy Space Center, pairs of bald eagles have stood watch for decades as towering vehicles of aluminum and carbon vaulted off pads just a few miles away.

Their nest, located just west of the spaceport's primary north-south artery known as Kennedy Parkway, is famous for its large size and ability to make visitors crane their necks during bus tours just to catch a glimpse – and maybe a photo.

But News 6 partner Florida Today reports that the roughly 80-year-old tree supporting the nest has died, according to wildlife biologists who oversee the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, which includes portions of KSC.

The likely culprit? Hurricane Irma.

"Before Irma, the tree was green and in good condition," said Mike Legare, a supervisory wildlife biologist with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, who said the roughly 8-foot-wide nest has occupied the tree since at least 1971. "It looks like Irma put a little lean into it and immediately after the storm, the needles lost some green."

From there, Legare said, it's possible that the tree's immune system – the production of sap to fend off unwanted visitors – was suppressed, paving the way for an infestation of pine bark beetles, which are common in the area.

When bark beetles begin burrowing into a pine tree, the damaged area fills with sap, forcing out the critter that is ultimately aiming to reproduce under the tree's bark, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

“The bottom line is, the hurricane weakened the tree to the point where pine bark beetles overtook it," Legare said.

Over the summer, officials conducted prescribed burns in the area, but the nest tree was singled out and protected from the blazes.

The tree's death, however, doesn't mean the end of the road for the nest.

“Eagles will readily use the nest in a dead tree,” Legare said. “It’s not the only pair of eagles we have that are using a dead tree.”

He expects the birds of prey will use it until it "literally falls down or the nest falls out," which could be up to several more years. That's also when biologists and others will be able to determine a more accurate age of the tree.

Bald eagles, one of the success stories of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, choose a nest in male-and-female pairs and defend the territory surrounding it for the duration of their stay. Naturally, biologists took an interest in the KSC nest in the 1970s and began documenting its progress as part of the larger protection effort.

Now, Merritt Island typically hosts between 15 to 18 bald eagle nests a year.

But the large KSC nest – its weight difficult to pinpoint – is remarkable due to its continued occupation by the birds for nearly 50 years, as well as its proximity to the bus tour route.

"It's an exceptional nest, at least on this property," Legare said. "It's deserved the attention."

In the meantime, bald eagle residents of the nest can continue to enjoy launches and landings of rockets named after another bird of prey – SpaceX's Falcon 9.

Jaykumar Patel confronts Castro with gun

Lazaro Jesus Castro has been charged with using a scanning device to defraud after he encountered Jaykumar Patel has owned the Marathon Gas station on County Road 48 in Yalaha, according to an arrest affidavit.

On Saturday afternoon, a weird message popped up on his register alerting him to an issue at one of his pumps.

“I went outside and I know the pump number two car, I know that guy really good,” Patel told Spectrum News 13. “So the pump number three, I had a suspicion on that guy.”

When Patel approached the 43-year-old Castro driving a large white box truck, he noticed the man had popped out part of the pump and connected wires to the inside. Patel said he immediately knew the man was skimming for credit card numbers.

“So I push on his door because his door was open, and my door was open. I saw his face but I could not see what he was doing, but the wire was going in there,” described Patel.

Patel confronted the man, and immediately Patel said Castro tried to intimidate him. Patel then pulled out a gun, attempting to hold him there until police arrived. However, according to Patel and the arrest affidavit, Castro took off.

Patel provided Lake County Sheriff's Office deputies with the license plate number and caught Lazaro Castro shortly after. In the truck, they found credit card skimmers and other evidence.

The arrest makes Patel happy and he hopes justice is served.

Castro is expected to be back in court Dec. 18.

According to the affidavit, Castro has been placed on "no bond status" because he is on probation in Orange County on similar charges.

Tampa Bay-area woman finds iguana in toilet

Neighbor removed iguana with net, cooler

Iguana turned over to Matthews Wildlife Rescue

According to FWC, spinytail iguanas are nonnative species



To her horror, there was a spinytail iguana, more than a foot long, taking a dip in her toilet.

"The toilet was clogged — on Sunday morning, it was clogged — so my husband unclogged it, and we just thought it was the kids using too much toilet paper. And this thing pops up 12 hours later," Craven said.

Craven panicked, and with her husband at work, she called for help on Facebook, asking anyone who could handle the situation to come by.

Minutes later, her neighbor showed up and went to work, pulling the iguana from the bathroom with a net and a cooler.

"The first thing people ask is, 'Are you on septic?' No, I'm on city water. I think that freaked a lot of people out," Craven said.

The iguana was handed over to Justin Matthews of Matthews Wildlife Rescue. He aptly named the reptile Flushy and said it's doing fine.

Matthews has seen cases in which snakes have ended up inside of toilets, but that's mainly been in apartment-style buildings.

But an iguana in a house toilet? That was a first for him.

"I think it was flushed," Matthews surmised.

But even with family in town for Thanksgiving making for a busy house, Craven said she won't be using that toilet again.

"I will avoid it forever," she said. "I will never go back in that bathroom. I'll gladly wait in line for my other bathroom 100 percent!"0
http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/CCPPP-Statement-on-the-Launch-of-Canada-s-Smart-Cities-Challenge-1009286659CCPPP Statement on the Launch of Canada's Smart Cities ChallengeToronto, Nov. 23, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships (CCPPP) enthusiastically salutes the Government of Canada’s Smart Cities Challenge. This is an exciting initiative that will allow Canadian communities to take a global leadership role in this first digital century.

In the parlance of the new millennium, the Smart City Challenge encourages cities, towns and Indigenous communities to disrupt themselves. It gives them permission and incentive to break out of the “we’ve always done it this way” trap.

“CCPPP has been a long-time supporter and promoter of the Smart Cities Challenge,” says Mark Romoff, CCPPP President and CEO. “This is a great opportunity to put Canadian ingenuity and resourcefulness on display to create communities that are safer, healthier, more accessible and economically vibrant. We congratulate the government for promoting and accelerating ‘big think’ ideas.”

This program has transformative potential that goes well beyond binary code connections among infrastructure and service delivery. The goal is to improve the lives of Canadians “through innovation, data and connected technology.”

The government will award up to $75 million in prizes to the winning communities, but could easily initiate hundreds of millions of dollars in inventive, visionary approaches to community and urban design.

Best of all, this program challenges conventional thinking. The innate innovative spirit of Smart Cities will require new and disruptive thinking. It will necessitate new eyes and bold ideas.

We’re confident the P3 industry will play an important role as the Smart City plans unfold. The model lends itself to the development of the new, innovative, high tech design that will connect infrastructure and services that provide Canadians the best value for their money.

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-11-cash-health.htmlGiving cash without strings attached can improve healthCredit: CC0 Public Domain New research has shown governments can help improve health in low and middle income countries, simply by providing cash to people living in poverty.

Dr Frank Pega, an honorary research fellow from the University of Otago, Wellington, has just published a major international review of the health effects of unconditional cash transfers. These are one type of governmental social protection intervention to tackle income poverty. Universal basic incomes, where everybody receives a basic income, are also a type of unconditional cash transfer.

The review identified 21 studies on the effect of such cash transfers on health service use and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Sixteen of the 21 studies were experimental. It was the first review of the health effects of this increasingly common type of international development assistance provided by governments around the world, including New Zealand, to an estimated 800 million people.

The results suggest that unconditional cash transfers lead to a reduction in the likelihood of having had any illness in the past few weeks or months by an estimated 27 per cent, according to Dr Pega.

"The review also showed that these cash transfers probably led to a moderate increase in the likelihood of children in recipient families attending school, and that they may improve food security, nutrition, and the amount of money recipients spent on health care," he writes.

Professor Nick Wilson, who was not directly involved in this study but has worked with Dr Pega at the University of Otago, Wellington, calls the findings promising for health and social benefits.

"This study shows that these types of cash transfers are an important form of international governmental development assistance for improving health among people living in poverty."

Data breaches like the one disclosed by Uber Technologies Inc. could soon draw fines from European regulators.

Public and private firms that operate in the European Union will be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation starting in May 2018. The sweeping set of regulations governs how companies use data collected from individuals and disclose breaches.

Companies which fail to report breaches that involve personal data will face a fine of up to 2% of global annual revenue or €10 million ($11.77 million), whichever is higher. Firms that process personal data without consent could be fined up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, depending on which one is higher.

Most EU-member authorities don’t currently have the power to impose fines on companies in the case of personal data breaches. This will change under the new regulation.

“This is quite a stepchange of how companies look at personal data as well as the potential loss of that data,” said Jim McCurry, head of Ernst & Young LLP’s European fraud investigation unit. “We are seeing many companies taking these criteria [lined out in the new regulation] quite seriously,” Mr. McCurry said.

The rules follow a string of high-profile breaches at American and European companies, including at consumer credit reporting company Equifax Inc., TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC and Yahoo Inc.

On Tuesday, ride-hailing company Uber disclosed it paid hackers $100,000 last year in an effort to conceal a data breach affecting 57 million accounts. The firm said it would notify owners of the affected accounts in the coming days.

“Had the new regulation been in place yet and was there evidence that data by EU citizens was affected, this would have direct implications for Uber,” said Laura Jehl, a partner at Baker & Hostetler LLP, a law firm.

​U.S. and U.K. regulators are already investigating the company because of the delay in disclosing the hack. Italian and Dutch authorities said they also planned to evaluate how Uber handled the data breach. “Chances are high that Uber would incur the maximum fine because they concealed the breach for such a long time,” said Ms. Jehl said. “It’s more than a year later. These kinds of violations would incur a high fine.”

EU regulators want companies to disclose these breaches sooner. Germany will require companies, whenever possible, to report any breach of personal information within 72 hours under the new EU rules.

Other countries are following suit, said Paul Taylor, head of KPMG LLP’s cybersecurity practice in the U.K. “Seventy two hours is emerging as a sort of standard among member states for reporting these breaches,” said Mr. Taylor. The U.K. is still in the process of developing detailed guidelines for the implementation of the EU data protection rules.

There are currently no overarching U.S. data-breach disclosure rules. Instead, companies must navigate a range of requirements across state legislation, in addition to U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s breach disclosure guidelines, which apply only to publicly traded companies.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/arts/design/david-hockney-art-review-metropolitan-museum-of-art.htmlDavid Hockney’s Life in Painting: Spare, Exuberant, FullThe earliest paintings indicate Mr. Hockney’s attention to Abstract Expressionism and Bacon’s figurative scrums and his penchant for scatterings of numbers, texts and product labels that presage Pop Art. They culminate in “The Third Love Painting” (1960) in which a large phallus-figure topped with black hairs contains a small block of hand-lettered text: the closing lines of a poem by Walt Whitman about his happiness while lying beside his sleeping lover, “under the same cover in the cool night.”

Homoeroticism turns sardonically explicit in “Cleaning Teeth, Early Evening (10pm) W11,” from 1962, in which two podlike creatures pleasure each other, their genitals depicted as red boxes labeled Colgate. And it emerges from the bedroom in the Baconesque “The Cha-Cha That Was Danced in the Early Hours of 24th March,” from 1961. Here a blurred figure in a white suit wearing heels and carrying a handbag dances before abstract blocks of red and blue. His name, Peter, is indicated, as is the artist’s reaction: “I love every movement.”

Photo

The next group of paintings — 10 from 1962 to 1965 — are a tour de force of artistic growth, spurred in part by travel, to Italy and New York and, in early 1964, to Los Angeles, about which he had fantasized for some time, inspired by both its sunny clime and the beefcake magazines published there. Evidence is the charmingly innocent “Domestic Scene, Los Angeles” of 1963, which shows a man wearing only socks and an apron washing the back of a man taking a shower, in the company of a comfy chintz-covered armchair. (The figures come from magazines like Young Physique.)

Photo

In these paintings, Mr. Hockney’s awkward figurative style fleshes out toward naturalism, impudently balancing between art and illustration. His scatterings of disparate props become more emphatic, as do expanses of raw canvas. These efforts may be the last, ironically cheerful gasp of the postwar period’s often lugubrious Existential figuration — at its best in Jean Dubuffet’s work, which Mr. Hockney admired.

Art becomes a character in its own right in two paintings that pair a man in contemporary dress with an exotically accoutered Egyptian statue. Aspects of Color Field abstraction show up as bright bands indicating rainbows, suns and mountains. Different modes of representation combine. In “California Art Collector,” a matron, rendered in modern grisaille, occupies an armchair beneath a lean-to that echoes the manger in Piero Della Francesca’s “Nativity” in the National Gallery in London.

Photo

The still spaces and figures of Piero’s art help Mr. Hockney achieve a unified naturalism, based on the observation of actual people, places and things. (In “The Room, Tarzana,” a quietly desirous image from 1967, the artist’s lover lies face down on a bed, naked below the waist.) The stage is set with clean-edged forms, suffusions of blue and nearly single-point perspectives that glorify the skies, swimming pools, architecture and lawns of Los Angeles. Abstraction lurks, especially in “A Bigger Splash” and “A Lawn Being Sprinkled.”0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/books/fiction-nigeria-writers.htmlA Wave of New Fiction From Nigeria, as Young Writers Experiment With New GenresA new wave of thematically and stylistically diverse fiction is emerging from the country, as writers there experiment with different genres and explore controversial subjects like violence against women, polygamy and the rise of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

“There are more avenues for Nigerian writers to express themselves now, and people are being more bold,” Mr. Ibrahim said.

Mr. Ibrahim’s publisher, Cassava Republic, has been at the forefront of Nigeria’s literary renaissance, and now the company has global ambitions. This spring, Cassava Republic began releasing its books in the United States, following its expansion into Britain last year.

Rather than selling publication rights to American publishing houses, as most foreign publishers do, Cassava Republic prints and distributes its titles to American booksellers through Consortium, a book distributor based in Minnesota. Eventually, the company plans to release all of its new titles in the United States, with first printings that range from 2,000 to 5,000 copies.

Its expansion is unlikely to have a major commercial impact, with just a handful of titles coming out in the United States and Britain each year. But culturally, the company’s global aspirations represent a significant new landmark for African literature. Until now, much if not all of the African literature in the West has been filtered through the tastes of European and American publishers and editors, who often select works they judge to be historically significant, educational or prize worthy. Now, for the first time, an African publisher is choosing which books get exported, and as a result, Western readers are gaining access to a greater variety of titles, ranging from contemporary African romance and hard-boiled crime to epic fantasy and children’s books.

“One of the things we are trying to do is expand the definition of African literature,” said Bibi Bakare-Yusuf, Cassava Republic’s co-founder and publisher. “Achebe’s ‘Things Fall Apart’ cannot define the whole continent. We should not be able to count African writers on one hand.”

Photo

When Ms. Bakare-Yusuf co-founded Cassava Republic in Abuja in 2006, her primary goal was to publish Nigerian writers who had gained stature in the West but weren’t being read at home. She began by acquiring publication rights to novels that were already available abroad, including two works by the Nigerian-born writer Abidemi Sanusi, and distributing them in Nigeria. Then she started looking for original work, and published a debut novella, “Every Day Is for the Thief,” by Teju Cole, which went on to become a critical sensation in Britain and the United States.

More than a decade later, Cassava Republic has published more than 50 titles, and has expanded into romance, crime, memoir, fantasy, science fiction and children’s books. It has published several breakout commercial hits, including Sarah Ladipo Manyika’s novel “In Dependence,” which sold more than 1.7 million copies, and “The Last Days at Forcados High School,” by A. H. Mohammed, which sold more than 2.5 million copies.

So far, Cassava Republic has published eight books in the United States, including children’s books, crime novels and literary fiction, a nonfiction book about the West African music scene and “Longthroat Memoirs,” a food memoir by Yemisi Aribisala, which came out this month. Cassava plans to publish nine books in the United States in 2018.

The novels that Cassava has distributed in the West span a range of genres, settings, subjects and styles, offering American readers a much broader view of contemporary Nigerian fiction. Novels released this year include Mr. Ibrahim’s “Season of Crimson Blossoms;” Ms. Ladipo Manyika’s novel, “Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun,” which centers on a 74-year-old Nigerian woman living in San Francisco, and Leye Adenle’s crime novel “Easy Motion Tourist,” a dark noir tale that unfolds in Lagos, where a British journalist who comes to cover the elections ends up investigating a series of gruesome murders targeting prostitutes.

Mr. Adenle, who grew up in Nigeria and now lives in London, said that more Nigerian novelists are experimenting with commercial tropes, writing for pure entertainment, and many no longer feel compelled to write novels that respond to the legacy of colonialism or Western notions about African literature.

As more young Nigerian debut authors rise to global prominence, the diversity and range of the country’s fiction is on full display. Chigozie Obioma’s debut novel, “The Fishermen,” a biblical parable set during the military dictatorship of the 1990s, was translated into more than 20 languages and was a finalist for the 2015 Man Booker Prize. Last year, Elnathan John’s debut novel “Born on a Tuesday,” which tackles the rise of Islamic extremism through the eyes of a homeless teenager who gets swept up in political violence, was heralded as “a stunning, important coming-of-age story” by a critic in Publishers Weekly.

In August, Knopf published Ayobami Adebayo’s debut novel, “Stay With Me,” a portrait of a Nigerian couple struggling with infertility, whose marriage is strained when his conservative family pressures him to take a second wife. The novel, which was published in Nigeria this spring, was shortlisted for Britain’s Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction, and received ecstatic reviews in The Guardian and The New York Times. Ms. Ayobami, who studied fiction writing with Ms. Adichie and Margaret Atwood, said she worried at first that Nigerian readers might balk at a novel that hinges on culturally touchy subjects like polygamy, infidelity and belief in magic. “I was quite nervous before the book came out here, but the response so far has been quite positive,” said Ms. Ayobami, who lives in Ile-Ife, in southwestern Nigeria.

Writers and publishers in Nigeria still face significant obstacles. Until fairly recently, the commercial publishing market consisted primarily of educational books. Piracy remains an entrenched problem that saps profits from the music, film and publishing industries. Pirated copies of books circulate at open air markets, and formal bookstores are scarce in some regions. Illiteracy remains an entrenched problem in parts of the country. And books are still considered an out-of-reach luxury for much of the population. The minimum wage in Nigeria hovers around $59 a month, and a new book costs around $8.

Despite such hurdles, Nigeria’s publishing industry has blossomed in recent years, following the country’s return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military dictatorship.

In the last decade or so, literary festivals, book prizes and writing workshops have sprung up around the country, and a handful of influential new publishing houses have been formed, including Cassava Republic, Farafina, Parrésia and Ouida Books, which was founded last year by the novelist Lola Shoneyin.

Ms. Shoneyin, the author of “The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives,” has emerged as a prominent figure in Nigeria’s publishing scene, somewhere between an impresario and a literary fairy godmother. In addition to writing fiction and running Ouida Books, she founded the Ake Festival, a five-day literary event in Abeokuta that began in 2013, and curated the Kaduna Book and Arts Festival, which kicked off this summer in northern Nigeria, a predominantly Muslim region that has suffered attacks by the fundamentalist group Boko Haram.

The Kaduna festival, which took place last month, featured a writing workshop for women that was led by the Sudanese author Leila Aboulela, and a session in Hausa, a local language, about the significance of Hausa literature in a country where English is the official language.

“Our project is to build the Nigerian and African market, and to build a market that’s more contained,” Ms. Shoneyin said. “The success of a Nigerian writer shouldn’t depend on their success in the West.”1

(Photo: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)

The first daughter attended the White House pardoning ceremony for the National Thanksgiving Turkey yesterday in a short leg-baring outfit, stealing the spotlight from the two turkeys being granted a second chance — Wishbone and Drumstick. For the occasion, Tiffany wore a short red tweed coat with hints of pink. She must have been wearing an even shorter dress or skirt underneath because her legs were bare and accentuated by black pumps.

The public was in large part shocked; multiple news outlets have reported not on the event but on Tiffany’s outfit. Hollywood Life called her jacket “very short” and said she “decided to turn heads by baring her long legs in a super-short minidress and equally short red jacket.” The Daily Mail questioned her choice considering the chilly fall weather. And Twitter agrees. Some called her look “saucy,” while others reprimanded her for wearing such an outfit to the White House. Many just wished she had worn pantyhose.

The second most talked-about person at the event? Not Donald, or even Wishbone, but Ivanka. She and her daughter Arabella were twinning in red coats, matching Tiffany. Ivanka’s outfit was a little more demure. She was decked out in head-to-toe Dolce and Gabbana, starting with a pink and red floral jacquard skirt that costs $1,695. On top she wore a double-breasted red peacoat with mismatching decorative buttons and a Sicilian-style standing collar. The coat retails for $3,000. She also wore black pumps and black tights

Arabella’s red coat featured a big bow on the neckline. She wore it with tall back boots.

Even Melania Trump jumped on the red bandwagon, pairing her long Thanksgiving-themed multicolor Stella McCartney coat, which is currently on sale for $975, with a red sweater and a brown leather skirt.

If this is how they dress for Thanksgiving, we can’t wait to see their coordinated Christmas outfits.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-micron-technology-004033336.htmlEstimating The Fair Value Of Micron Technology Inc (MU)How far off is Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, I am going to take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced using the discounted cash flows (DCF) model. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. If you are reading this after November 2017 then I highly recommend you check out the latest calculation for Micron Technology here.

Is MU fairly valued?

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which simply means we have two different periods of varying growth rates for the company’s cash flows. Generally the initial phase has higher growth rates that plateau over time. Firstly, I took the analyst consensus forecast of MU’s levered free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years and discounted these values at the rate of 11.12%. When estimates weren’t available, I’ve extrapolated the average annual growth rate over the previous five years, capped at a reasonable level. This resulted in a present value of 5-year cash flow of $19,435M. Want to understand how I arrived at this number? Read our detailed analysis here.

NasdaqGS:MU Intrinsic Value Nov 23rd 17 More

The infographic above illustrates how MU’s top and bottom lines are expected to move going forward, which should give you an idea of MU’s outlook. Now we need to determine the terminal value, which is the business’s cash flow after the first stage. It’s appropriate to use the 10-year government bond rate of 2.8% as the stable growth rate, which is rightly below GDP growth, but more towards the conservative side. After discounting the terminal value back five years, the present value becomes $42,249M.

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is $61,684M. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. This results in an intrinsic value of $53.49, which, compared to the current share price of $49.4, we find that Micron Technology is about right, perhaps slightly undervalued at a 7.64% discount to what it is available for right now.

Next Steps:

Whilst important, DCF calculation shouldn’t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

For MU, there are three pertinent factors you should look at:

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/23/new-manafort-travel-docs-reveal-closer-ties-to-russia-report.htmlNew Manafort travel docs reveal closer ties to Russia: reportPaul Manafort had taken 18 trips to Moscow and was in contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s allies for more than a decade before running President Trump’s 2016 election campaign, a new report said Thursday.

Manafort, who was indicted by a federal grand jury last month on 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, had also taken at least 19 trips to Kiev to work with a pro-Kremlin political faction before joining Trump’s team, McClatchy reported.

The news outlet cited flight records they obtained from Ukrainian authorities as well as intelligence gathered from current and foreign government officials. The new evidence suggests Manafort’s ties to the Kremlin go much deeper than previously thought.

Even after the February 2014 fall of Ukraine’s pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, Manafort continued to go to Kiev another 19 times in fewer than two years while working for the smaller, pro-Russian Opposition Block party, McClatchy reported.

Some have suggested Manafort had been turned into an asset acting on Moscow’s behalf.

“You can make a case that all along he ...was either working principally for Moscow, or he was trying to play both sides against each other just to maximize his profits,” Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state who communicated with Manafort during Yanukovych’s reign in President George W. Bush’s second term, told McClatchy.

“He’s at best got a conflict of interest and at worst is really doing Putin’s bidding,” Fried, now a fellow with the Atlantic Council, said.

A central question for Justice Department Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller and several congressional committees has been whether Manafort collaborated with Russia’s cyber meddling aimed at giving Trump the electoral edge over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

A source familiar with the matter told McClatchy that investigators are looking over information they obtained as part of a deeper dive into Russian influence in the U.S. presidential elections.

Manafort resigned on Aug. 19, 2016 after The New York Times reported handwritten ledgers showed $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments to Manafort from Yanukovych. Investigators in Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau contend the payments were part of an illegal off-the-books system.

FBI agents raided Manafort’s Virginia home in July, taking documents that included financial and tax records.

Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted and last month pleaded not guilty to all 12 counts.

A judge set bond at $10 million for Manafort, and $5 million for Gates. Both were put on house arrest.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson gave Manafort and Gates permission to leave their home and have Thanksgiving with their families, but said they must wear a GPS ankle monitor and not consume alcohol.-1
https://impact.vice.com/en_us/article/mb3zq4/america-should-take-better-notice-of-native-american-heritage-monthAmerica Should Take Better Notice of Native American Heritage MonthPhoto via VICELAND

President Donald Trump, following in the footsteps of his predecessors, proclaimed November National Native American Heritage Month on Oct. 31.



“Native Americans are a testament to the deep importance of culture and vibrancy of traditions, passed down throughout generations. This month, I encourage all of our citizens to learn about the rich history and culture of the Native American people,” states the proclamation.

However, it wasn’t long after this proclamation that Trump posted a tweet on November 3, calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), “Pocahontas.” Critics were quick to point out the president’s name-calling as an insensitivity to those with Native American roots.

“I think that if we didn't have Native American Awareness Month, then we wouldn't have any mandatory time set aside to raise awareness."

It’s likely why, despite federal proclamations of a heritage month in November for Native Americans since 1990, that many people still don’t understand why the month exists or live in communities that don’t provide celebrations or awareness in honor of the month, at all.

Massachusetts declared November Native American Awareness Month years ago and has seen tremendous strides in the community. Some attribute this improvement of race relations to the state’s acknowledgment of its indigenous community.

Watch some more video from VICE:

According to Boston.com, "Since the Massachusetts Center for Native American Awareness was incorporated in 1989, co-founder and president Burne Stanley-Peters said awareness of native culture has improved among the general population.”

“I think that if we didn't have Native American Awareness Month, then we wouldn't have any mandatory time set aside to raise awareness. Now, governmental and academic spaces put aside time and funds to have speakers and presentations,” Claudia Fox Tree, a board member of the Massachusetts Center for Native American Awareness, told VICE Impact.

The Mashpee Wampanoag, the Native American tribe who hosted the colonists for the first Thanksgiving, are still very involved in the state – especially in the month of November. The Mashpee Wampanoag hosted a Thanksgiving event at the Massachusetts Statehouse on November 13, with the purpose of promoting “peace and unity among all Americans,” according to the Associated Press.

“My experience has been that many (even most) people know very little about Native American history and culture, so any information is important, and often new,” Fox Tree said, referring to the importance of people spending time in the month November to not only give thanks but to raise awareness and celebrate Native American culture.

“Also, it gives us, as indigenous people, a place to address significant issues that are in the news or lacking in complete understanding,” she added.

It’s likely that if the rest of the country followed Massachusetts’s approach to the month of November that it could help with peace relations on a national level by helping to shed light on the groups who need it most for Thanksgiving.

Being able to help or spread awareness isn’t a hard feat. There are many ways for those, no matter their location, to get involved this month and honor Native American heritage. The first step is to understand why Thanksgiving is also known as National Mourning Day by some Americans who gather in Plymouth, Massachusetts, each year.

“All around the country, schools continue to dress up their children in little Pilgrim and Indian costumes and the Indians welcome the Pilgrims and they all sit down together and everybody says, 'Isn’t that cute, that’s so nice.'"

“The real underlying issue is the mythology; there’s a view that we’re this big melting pot country, or there’s a view that the Natives and the Pilgrims lived happily ever after and the Native people just evaporated into the woods or something to make way for the Pilgrims and all of the other aspects of the European invasion,” Mahtowin Munro, co-leader of United American Indians of New England, told HuffPost in regards to why it’s imperative Americans start having open and honest conversations about what Thanksgiving really means to some Americans.

“All around the country, schools continue to dress up their children in little Pilgrim and Indian costumes and the Indians welcome the Pilgrims and they all sit down together and everybody says, ‘Isn’t that cute, that’s so nice.’ That’s not at all what happened,” she said.

Get involved with the Massachusetts Center For Native American Awareness by volunteering in these different areas. Also, make sure you check out National Heritage Sites, where you can find tribal sites throughout the country for you to either make a donation to help preserve them or simply make a visit.0

Net income after net movements in regulatory balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $121.4 million compared to $128.0 million for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease over the previous year was primarily due to lower electricity consumption in 2017, higher operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, and a one-time Incremental Capital Module regulatory balance booked as an increase in net income in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by higher 2017 electricity distribution rates and higher other revenue related to the achievement of the Conservation and Demand Management ("CDM") mid-term incentive.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nyc-commutes-in-photos-2017-11This photographer captured shots of New Yorkers on their way to work for 10 years -- and it shows how repetitive a commute can bePeter Funch An New York commuter photographed on June 7 and July 11, 2012.

The photographer Peter Funch photographed the same Manhattan corner during the morning rush hour for 10 years.

Intrigued by the idea of repetition, he captured photos of the same people on their way to work.

His new book, “42nd and Vanderbilt,” is a collection of his work from the series.

About 700,000 people pass through Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal on their way to work every day.

In 2007, the photographer Peter Funch began staking out a corner of the station, at 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, to document those commuters. Funch would snap photos from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., and he would often photograph the same subject twice – sometimes days apart, other times years.

Fascinated by these small moments of human behaviour, Funch created a series that explores the seemingly mundane. His unknowing subjects are captured smoking, listening and singing along to music, watching people, and making eye contact with other commuters.

“All these moments are telling small stories about us,” he told Business Insider.

His new book, “42nd and Vanderbilt,” places his subjects side by side. The two photos, taken at different moments, show the similarities in the day-to-day and explore the idea of repetition and ritual. Funch said the photos captured “that trance we are in when going from A to B.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/north-korea-removes-border-guards-162124863.htmlNorth Korea Removes All Border Guards after Failing to Prevent Soldier's DefectionNorth Korea reportedly replaced all border security guards after a North Korean soldier dashed across the demarcation line at the heavily guarded Joint Security Area in the demilitarized zone (DMZ). It was a rare and dramatic defection, an intelligence source told South Korean news agency Yonhap.

According to the source, the border guards may have been punished for their failure in stopping the defection.

"Signs were detected that North Korea has replaced all border security officials following the defection. Given this situation, commanders of the responsible military unit and senior officers might have undergone punishment," the source was quoted as saying in an article published Thursday.

It would not be unprecedented for the North Korean regime, led by Kim Jong Un, to punish border guards for failing to prevent defections. According to the human rights organization Amnesty International, a commander and a vice commander of a border post near China were arrested and sentenced to death earlier this year following an official investigation into North Korean defectors, many of whom flee the country over the Chinese border.

Earlier this week, the South Korean intelligence agency told lawmakers about rare punitive actions taken against top North Korean officials following an inspection of the military’s hugely influential General Political Bureau, an organ devoted to ensuring adherence to the ruling party line among the Korean People’s Army ranks, reportedly due to their “impure attitude.”

The punishment was initially seen as a possible sign of infighting among Kim’s key aides, but it could also be related to the border guards (carefully handpicked for their ideological commitment to the regime) and their inability to prevent the defection.

An edited video of the area’s CCTV footage the United Nations Command released on Wednesday showed a group of border guards wearing bulletproof vests and armed with pistols and AK-47s chasing after the soldier.

They fired at least 40 rounds at the soldier, who had exited the jeep he drove past a checkpoint after it appeared to get stuck in a ditch. He then ran across the border line. One of the North Korean guards appears to cross South Korea's border, violating the terms of the 1953 Korean War armistice.

The 24-year-old soldier, identified by his surname, Oh, in a Wednesday press conference, suffered gunshot wounds to his abdomen and chest area and collapsed on a pile of dead leaves, just after crossing into South Korea.

The three South Korean soldiers—1st class sergeants Noh Yeong Soo and Song Seoung Hyeon, and deputy commander lieutenant colonel Kwon Young Hwan—crawled to his rescue. They were among six servicemen who contributed to saving the defector's life. The other three were American soldiers: sergeant Robert Hartfield, major Jeffery Schmidt and lieutenant colonel Matthew Farmer. All six were awarded a medal on Thursday.

“In recognition for their efforts in rescuing a North Korean defector, Nov.13, General Vincent K. Brooks, United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea commander, awarded Joint Security Area soldiers the Army Commendation medal,” a post shared on the U.S. Forces Korea Facebook page read.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-paid-hackers-100-000-233004213.htmlUber Paid Hackers $100,000 to Keep Secret a Massive Data Breach In 2016Uber Technologies Inc paid hackers $100,000 to keep secret a massive breach last year that exposed the data of some 57 million accounts of the ride-service provider, the company said on Tuesday.

Discovery of the company’s cover-up of the incident resulted in the firing of two employees who led Uber’s response to the hack, said Dara Khosrowshahi, who was named CEO in August following the departure of founder Travis Kalanick.

Khosrowshahi said he had only recently learned of the breach, which happened in October 2016.

“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Khosrowshahi said in a blog post on the company website.

The company’s admission that it failed to disclose the breach comes as Uber seeks to recover from sexual harassment allegations and multiple federal criminal probes that culminated in Kalanick’s ouster in June.

The company said two hackers gained access to proprietary information used by Uber and stored on GitHub, a service that allows engineers to collaborate on software code. The two people downloaded the data, which included names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers of Uber users around the world and the names and driver’s license numbers of 600,000 U.S. drivers, Khosrowshahi said.

“While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,” Khosrowshahi said. “We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers.”

Bloomberg News first reported the data breach on Tuesday.

Khosrowshahi said Uber had begun notifying regulators. The New York attorney general has opened an investigation into the data breach, a spokeswoman said.

Uber said it fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, and a deputy, Craig Clark, this week because of their role in the handling of the incident. Sullivan, formerly the top security official at Facebook Inc and a federal prosecutor, served as both security chief and deputy general counsel for Uber.

Sullivan declined to comment when reached by Reuters. Clark could not immediately be reached for comment.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

Kalanick learned of the breach in November 2016, a month after it took place, as the company was in negotiations with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the handling of consumer data.

A person familiar with the breach said a board committee investigated the matter and concluded that neither Kalanick nor Salle Yoo, Uber’s general counsel at the time, were involved in the decision not to disclose the stolen data. The person did not say when the investigation took place.

Kalanick, through a spokesman, declined to comment.

Although payments to hackers are rarely publicly discussed, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and private security companies have told Reuters that an increasing number of companies are paying thieves to recover stolen data.

Uber has a history of failing to protect driver and passenger data. Hackers previously stole information about Uber drivers and the company acknowledged in 2014 that its employees had used a software tool called “God View” to track passengers.

Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday that he had hired Matt Olsen, former general counsel of the U.S. National Security Agency, to restructure the company’s security teams and processes. The company also hired Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm owned by FireEye Inc, to investigate the breach.

The new CEO has traveled the world since replacing Kalanick to deliver a message that the company has matured from it earlier days as a rule-flouting startup.

“The new CEO faces an unknown number of problems fostered by the culture promoted by his predecessor,” said Erik Gordon, an expert in entrepreneurship and technology at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Brendan Evans, 31, faces up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted.

The pit bull, named Ollie, was found stuffed inside a blue suitcase in an alley Oct. 10 after officers followed the sound of his cries. He had been stabbed more than 50 times.

PIT BULL DIES AFTER BEING STABBED 50 TIMES, LEFT FOR DEAD IN SUITCASE

Ollie died at an animal hospital two days after he was found. His story led to adoption offers from around the country, and a GoFundMe page set up for him raised about $40,000 before his death.

"Hollywood detectives and officers have seen and investigated animal cruelty cases before, but none as horrific as what we’ve seen in the case of Ollie,” said police spokeswoman Miranda Grossman.

"We will not tolerate any form of animal cruelty or violence in our city," Hollywood Acting Police Chief Chris O'Brien said in a statement. "Each reported case of animal cruelty, be it physical abuse or neglect, is disturbing, and this case is particularly heartbreaking. We were all pulling for Ollie to survive, but unfortunately he didn’t make it.

"However, due to our investigation, we are now able to provide justice for Ollie," O'Brien said.

According to a police report, officers who searched Evans' apartment Nov. 14 discovered several mutilated rats in the freezer, along with two cat paws, knives covered with dried blood and animal fur. Officers also discovered an eight-pointed star as well as a candlelit shrine that included pieces of a flyer about Ollie's death.

They also found notes, one of which read, "Make the entire pit bull investigation go away. Return all curses placed on Brendan to their sender. Give Brendan peace of mind." As officers searched his apartment, the Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported, Evans posted a message on Facebook claiming to be a voodoo priest.

DNA taken from the suitcase where Ollie was found was a match for Evans and WSVN reported officers found one of the pit bull's teeth in the suspect's wallet.

The Sun-Sentinel reported that Evans was arrested by Broward County sheriff’s deputies in 2012 on domestic battery charges and is currently on probation for a 2015 bank robbery in Hernando County. WSVN reported that Evans' fingerprints also link him to a residential burglary in Hollywood.

The paper also reported that a Fort Lauderdale police officer spotted Evans attempting to kick a duck and her ducklings. When questioned, Evans said he wanted to kill the ducks because he practices voodoo. Police said Evans also purchased two kittens this past June from a person in Delray Beach who called police when Evans called back a few days later requesting to buy more kittens.

Neighbors of Evans expressed relief at his capture, with one telling WSVN, "He could have graduated and moved up, you know, so I’m just glad that they got him."

The Cambridge and Vancouver-based company has been named as one of Canada's Most Admired™ Corporate Cultures by Waterstone Human Capital.

"What's remarkable about this dynamic list of 2017 winners is their commitment to culture as a competitive advantage," said Marty Parker, President and CEO of Waterstone Human Capital and Chair of Canada's Most Admired™ Corporate Cultures. "They truly set the benchmark for cultivating, and sustaining, great cultures that ultimately drive their growth and performance. The 2017 winning organizations are to be admired for the diverse and impactful ways they make sure culture underpins all that makes them successful."

http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/Aurora-Cannabis-to-Acquire-H2-Biopharma-1009290602Aurora Cannabis to Acquire H2 BiopharmaLachute, Quebec Site will be Company's Fourth Advanced-Technology Production Facility

TSX: ACB

VANCOUVER, Nov. 23, 2017 /CNW/ - Aurora Cannabis Inc. (the "Company" or "Aurora") (TSX: ACB) (OTCQB: ACBFF) (Frankfurt: 21P; WKN: A1C4WM) today announced that the Company has entered into a binding share purchase agreement to acquire H2 Biopharma Inc. ("H2"). H2 is a late stage ACMPR applicant based in Lachute, Quebec.

H2 is currently completing a state-of-the-art, purpose-built 48,000 square foot cannabis production facility, less than an hour from Montreal (the "Lachute Facility"), and near the Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport. Upon completion, which is anticipated before the end of 2017, the Lachute Facility is projected to produce approximately 4,500 kilograms of high-quality cannabis per annum. The facility is located on 46 acres (19 hectares) of land (the "Property"), which H2 has the right to acquire for $136,000. The Property has access to ample low-cost power, water and infrastructure to support a very significant capacity expansion – up to or beyond the scale of the Company's 800,000 square foot Aurora Sky facility, currently under construction at Edmonton International Airport.

The latest Aurora acquisition will be the Company's fourth production facility in Canada - and second site in Quebec, in addition to its 40,000 square foot production "Aurora Vie" facility in Pointe-Claire, on the island of Montreal.

"This is another outstanding transaction that further extends Aurora's lead in establishing advanced-technology, ultra-efficient, low-cost production via purpose-built facilities," said Terry Booth, CEO. "The Lachute Facility, which is 80% complete and has the land and utilities required for significant additional expansion, is fully consistent with the Aurora Standard, and will be instrumental in delivering high quality products for the Quebec, Canadian and overseas markets. Our participation in the final design and construction of H2's purpose built facility will allow us to leverage our experience, technology, and systems to improve performance and yields beyond the original design. Our recent acquisition of Larssen Ltd. and the formation of Aurora Larssen Projects will play an instrumental role in this respect, and we look forward to a rapid completion of this project in line with the exceptional execution we have shown at Aurora Vie, our other Quebec project."

A central fact of the domestic and global emerging markets is the enormous excess of demand over supply for legal, regulated cannabis products. By leveraging our powerful cash position and excellent liquidity, as well as our experience building the most technologically advanced cannabis facilities, Aurora has a unique ability to acquire top-notch production and distribution assets at attractive valuations, thereby rapidly expanding capacity to meet surging Canadian and global demand."

André Jerome, CEO of H2, added, "We are proud to be joining forces with Aurora, a trail blazer in Canada and around the world in shaping the legal cannabis industry. With the backing of Aurora's operational and cultivation know-how, technological innovation and financial strength, we are confident the Lachute site will be a showcase cannabis production facility, and an important asset in the Company's execution of its domestic and international growth strategy."

Consideration

The acquisition is subject to approval by Toronto Stock Exchange, and other customary closing conditions. An initial payment of $10 million will be made, with further payments in consideration of the acquisition to be made upon the achievement of certain performance related milestones, including completion of the Facility, the granting of cultivation and sales licenses by Health Canada, and municipal approval for expansion of the facility. The total contingent consideration for the acquisition of H2, including closing and milestone payments, is $25 million and all payments will be satisfied through the issuance of Aurora common shares.

About Aurora

Aurora's wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurora Cannabis Enterprises Inc., is a licensed producer of medical cannabis pursuant to Health Canada's Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations ("ACMPR"). The Company operates a 55,200 square foot, state-of-the-art production facility in Mountain View County, Alberta, known as "Aurora Mountain", a second 40,000 square foot high-technology production facility known as "Aurora Vie" in Pointe-Claire, Quebec on Montreal's West Island, and is currently constructing an 800,000 square foot production facility, known as "Aurora Sky", at the Edmonton International Airport.

In addition, the Company holds approximately 9.6% of the issued shares (12.9% on a fully-diluted basis) in leading extraction technology company Radient Technologies Inc., based in Edmonton, and holds approximately 22% of Edmonton-based Hempco Food and Fiber with the ability to increase holdings to over 50%. Furthermore, Aurora is the cornerstone investor with a 19.9% stake in Cann Group Limited, the first Australian company licensed to conduct research on and cultivate medical cannabis. Aurora also owns Pedanios, a leading wholesale importer, exporter, and distributor of medical cannabis in the European Union, based in Germany. The Company offers further differentiation through its acquisition of BC Northern Lights Ltd. and Urban Cultivator Inc., industry leaders, respectively, in the production and sale of proprietary systems for the safe, efficient and high-yield indoor cultivation of cannabis, and in state-of-the-art indoor gardening appliances for the cultivation of organic microgreens, vegetables and herbs in home and professional kitchens.

This reduction of 95% of the present emission level equates to immediately taking at least 19,000 petrol driven vehicles off the roads.

This is significant in the context that there are approximately 5,000 electric vehicles registered now and the national target is 64,000 by the end of 2021.

Ali vs Frazier. Harding vs Kerrigan. Vader vs Kenobi. The NBN vs the entire country of Australia. These are the great rivalries of our histories. In the world of cricket, there’s no greater rivalry than that of England vs Australia in the five match Test extravaganza known as ‘The Ashes’.

The Ashes kick off today in Brisbane and here’s how you can watch – on TV or live online and free!

Yes, it’s that time of the bi-year again, when Australia and England’s best cricketers face off to claim an urn of charred cricket ball ash no bigger than a Coke can. It’s one of the biggest events on the Australian sporting calendar and a fixture of the summer, so without further ado – here’s how you can join in on the fun.

What is The Ashes?

The Ashes are a five match Test cricket series played in both England and Australia, with the home team alternating between the two nations every couple of years. You win the Ashes trophy – a tiny 15cm tall urn – by winning the five game series. The winner then holds the Ashes and can retain them simply by drawing the five game series the next time it is played. At present, England hold the Ashes as they won on their home turf back in 2015.

At present, a nice 69 series have been played between the two nations, with 32 wins a piece and 5 drawn series.

Where are The Ashes test matches played?

This year it’s Australia’s turn as host and the first match will be played at the Gabba in Brisbane Queensland. The following four test matches will be played at Adelaide Oval, the WACA, the MCG and the SCG and will run over the summer and into 2018.

When is The Ashes 2017?

The first Test begins today, November 23 at 11am AEDT. Test matches can last for up to five days, so you’ll need to tune in from 11am AEDT every day if you’re trying to catch all the bat-and-ball action you can.

Here’s that time for the first Test in all Australian capital cities:

Perth, WA: 8:00am

Darwin, NT: 9:30am

Brisbane, QLD: 10am

Adelaide, SA: 10:30am

Sydney, NSW: 11am

Canberra, ACT: 11am

Melbourne, VIC: 11am

Hobart, TAS: 11am

The second Test will be played from December 2 at Adelaide Oval

The third Test begins on December 14, at the WACA in Perth

The fourth Test is the traditional Boxing Day test match, taking place on December 26 at the MCG

The fifth and final Test is played at Sydney’s SCG and begins on January 4, 2018

We will update this post with local times for the second through fifth Test as they get closer.

Where can I watch The Ashes 2017?

Australians are no doubt familiar that summer cricket matches are the chief domain of Channel Nine, who manage to show plenty of the game in between KFC ads. If you want to catch the game on free to air TV, then you will need to tune into Channel 9 from 11am AEDT today.

Update: We originally reported that 9Now would have the broadcast online but it appears this is incorrect. Unfortunately, 9Now is not carrying the Ashes due to broadcast rights, which seems a bit backwards to me but that’s the way these things work with the internet and advertising and feeling like we’re stuck in the 90’s. For a reliable stream, I would recommend visiting the Reddit community listed below.

You could also invest in a VPN and set it to a location in the UK that broadcasts the game. This should grant you access to a live streaming service originating in England – but I understand that it’d be grating for Aussie fans to listen to the Poms applaud their squad all afternoon. I haven’t personally tested this theory out yet, but it appears that BT Sport have the rights to the Ashes in the UK. Their online live streaming service is something you need to sign up for so I wouldn’t recommend this option for anyone Down Under – though it does existed. Note that a VPN does cost money and is a little difficult to fully understand, so head to our handy guide to work out which VPN works best for you. Outside of watching the Ashes, a great VPN is a must-have these days anyway.

You could also sign up for a subscription to Cricket.com.au but this will set you back $29.99 a year – a pretty reasonable price if you’ve exhausted all your options – and it’s great if you’re passionate about your fours and sixes because it gives you access to every Big Bash League T20 match over the summer.

On the other hand, if a yearly pass isn’t your thing, then you can always grab a 24 hour pass for $5.99 but that seems exorbitant, considering streaming just five days will set you back the full cost of a year. The option is there though. If you’re an Optus customer and are eligible for Optus sport, you’re covered for the entire summer of cricket already, you’ll just need to activate your subscription.

My last recommendation is to always keep one eye firmly planted on the Reddit cricket community. They have a fantastic wiki full of useful information and ways to stream for those trying to watch the Ashes outside of the usual sources posted above. There’s a vibrant, global community on Reddit that tend to help each other out with these sorts of things so no matter where you’re coming from, you should be able to find what you’re after.

https://www.businessinsider.com.au/robots-amazon-australia-delivery-2017-11Robots could help Amazon beat Australia's slow delivery problemPhoto: Christophe Morin/ IP3/ Getty Images

Amazon’s launch in Australia today is likely to put fresh scrutiny on the speed of Australia Post’s own deliveries. To that end, Australia Post is trialling the use of robots to deliver parcels more promptly.

Research finds that consumer trust in a postal brand can influence willingness to purchase from an online retailer who ships with that carrier. Positive perceptions of postal services are not just important to the services themselves, but also to the online retailers who use them.

According to a survey by Choice Australia, this presents a complex problem for Australian delivery services. Australian services face both a large geographic area and a dispersed population. Added to this, globalisation and social media have meant that Australian consumers know that US and European consumers can get their parcels on the same day (albeit at extra cost).

Australia Post is attempting to provide an innovative solution to ensuring efficient deliveries, yet some have criticised the lack of practicality inherent in these robots, which need to be accompanied by a human and can (thus far) only carry one parcel at a time.

Early prototypes of delivery robots

Currently, most delivery robots are used to deliver food.

Delivery robots have raised safety concerns and convenience issues, but overall this is about innovation, and to most effectively use delivery services to add value for the consumer. Imagine a delivery robot that cooks your pizza while driving – ensuring that your pizza is literally hot from the oven when it arrives – Zume pizza is almost there.

Lessons can also be taken from the failings of other autonomous robots – to ensure value, developers must play to the natural strengths of robots rather trying to get robots to emulate human roles.

Robotic security guards can reduce the danger a human security guard is exposed to, and allow for near-constant patrols. However, these robots too have had safety issues with one running into a young boy at a US shopping mall and another reportedly drowning itself in a shopping centre fountain.

Why aren’t these robots everywhere yet?

Australia Post’s robots are still in trial stages and represent the first step towards a day when delivery robots are a standard part of how products are efficiently delivered to customers.

However, there are a range of concerns that need to be addressed before we start seeing delivery robots everywhere. These include:

Inefficiencies: Many delivery robots still need a human minder to ensure everything goes smoothly, help the robot navigate it’s environment, and prevent thefts. Australia needs a more efficient postal network, so inefficiencies like these need to be addressed.

Theft: Of course, there is also the possibility that someone will steal the parcel from the robot before it arrives. This is not the first time that people have raised the idea of stealing from a delivery robot.

Luckily though, stealing from a robot is about as hard as stealing from a human, with most delivery robots equipped with an array of sensors and cameras that report back to base. These robots also tend to be heavy, making it difficult to pick one up and run with it.

Still in development: Delivery robots are still developing. Additional capabilities are needed to add value for consumers. What if the delivery robot could learn your preferences and share them with other robots involved in deliveries, so you would never have to leave delivery instructions again? Consumers also need the chance to get used to robots, with studies showing that we are more patient with predictable robots, and that we rate robots more favourably when we perceive them to be in our in-group.

The future is robotic

The core service that needs to be offered is safe, reliable, and fast delivery. This needs to happen all over Australia, and if delivery robots can help us reach more people, faster and easier than before, then Australian consumers will welcome the robots.

Any new innovation in delivery services needs to have a relative advantage over previous services. Delivery companies need to consider what would add value for consumers. This value should be something that can be provided better by a delivery robot than by a human.

And of course, delivery robots are fun and novel, but there is a risk of disappointing consumers if robots are not yet ready or don’t perform as well as expected. No doubt Amazon will be working on ways to improve Australian delivery services to meet its expected Australian customer base.

Whether you think they’re ready to deliver your post or not, delivery robots will continue to develop. The prototypes of the first telephone don’t compare to modern equivalents – but without that first step, we wouldn’t be enjoying the benefits of smartphones today. Watch this space.

Al Franken (D-Minn.) on Thursday, saying that President Donald Trump once “hit on my wife” at a Manhattan hotel. Baldwin also slammed the president as a “5th degree black belt when it comes to sexual impropriety allegations.”

Baldwin jumped into the fray after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about new allegations against Franken. He was referring to a HuffPost report published Wednesday in which two other women stepped forward saying Franken inappropriately touched them on the butt. That makes the third and fourth such allegations against Franken in the past week.

Baldwin responded with the quip about the president’s “black belt” status, adding that Trump once “crashed” a Baldwin party at the Plaza Hotel and “hit on my wife” until she “showed his fat ass the door.”

Your Dad is a 5th degree black belt when it comes to sexual impropriety allegations.

In fact… I once had a party at the Plaza Hotel… your father showed up uninvited & hit on my wife… invited her on his helicopter to Atlantic City.



She showed his fat ass the door.#TrumpRussia https://t.co/A8BInetbbZ — Billy Baldwin (@BillyBaldwin) November 23, 2017

Baldwin has been married to Chynna Phillips, a singer with the band Wilson Phillips, since 1995 and the two have three children. The actor didn’t reveal what year the Plaza party occurred; Trump purchased the hotel in 1988.

But Trump has publicly discussed hitting on married women. In the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape revealed in 2005, he talked about being attracted to a married woman and said he “moved on her like a bitch.” He added: “But I couldn’t get there; and she was married.” He also said that as a celebrity, “You can do anything ... grab them by the pussy.”

Some 16 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Summer Zervos, a contestant on Trump’s former reality TV program, “The Apprentice,” is suing the president for defamation for calling her a liar after she accused him of groping her.

The president has slammed Baldwin’s brother, Alec, a number of times on Twitter for his scorching portrayal of Trump on “Saturday Night Live.”

Most Twitter responses to Donald Trump Jr.’s tweet were in the same vein as Baldwin’s, with people calling out the president’s son on his hypocrisy. One response called the president the “holy grail” of sexual impropriety.

I know you are not very bright, but here is a hint, when your father is the holy grail of sexual abuse, dont go around posting about others. avoiding the topic is your better option. — Kholoudf (@Kholoudkhalid) November 23, 2017-1

Pistorius was imprisoned in July last year after being found guilty on appeal of murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day 2013 in a case that attracted worldwide interest.

Steenkamp’s family welcomed the increased sentence saying it showed that justice could prevail in South Africa.

“This is an emotional thing for them. They just feel that their trust in the justice system has been confirmed this morning,” Tania Koen, a spokeswoman for the Steenkamp family, told Reuters.

The athlete was not in court for Friday’s ruling where the court handed down the minimum 15-year sentence prescribed for murder in South Africa, and subtracted the years Pistorius had already served in jail.

The athlete was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in jail. That conviction was increased to murder by the SCA in December 2015 and his sentence increased to six years by trial Judge Thokozile Masipa.

When seeking an appeal earlier this month state prosecutors argued that the six-year sentence handed to Paralympic gold medallist was “shockingly lenient”.-1

Chocolate cream biscuits

Homemade Arnott's Tim Tam recipe.

"This is my homage to that great Australian bikkie, the Tim Tam. Although there have been all sorts of new flavours added to the range over the years, for me it's all about the original version. Here's mine," Moran said.

INGREDIENTS

160g plain (all-purpose) flour

40g (⅓ cup) icing (confectioners') sugar, sieved

40g (⅓ cup) Dutch-process cocoa, sieved

80g (⅓ cup) unsalted butter, diced

1 egg

100g (⅔ cup) each dark chocolate buttons and milk chocolate buttons

Chocolate cream filling:

100ml single (pure/pouring) cream

80g (½ cup) dark chocolate buttons

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 160°C (315°F) and lightly grease a baking tray. To prepare the biscuit dough, sieve the flour, icing sugar and cocoa powder into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Add the butter, then rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Mix in the egg to make a dough, form into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour to rest. While the biscuit dough rests, make the chocolate cream filling. Bring the cream to the boil in a small saucepan over a medium–high heat, remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Stand for five minutes, then stir until the chocolate is smooth and combined. Refrigerate until beginning to firm, then transfer to a piping bag and set aside. Roll out the biscuit dough on a lightly floured work surface into a 5mm thick 20 x 50cm (8 x 20 inch) rectangle, then cut into 4 x 8cm (1½ x 3 inch) rectangles (use a ruler to help keep them even). Place the rectangles onto the prepared tray, bake for 10–15 minutes until crisp, then cool completely on a wire rack. To prepare the chocolate coating, melt all the chocolate buttons in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (make sure the base of the bowl doesn't touch the water), stirring occasionally until smooth. To assemble, pipe the chocolate filling over half of the biscuits, then sandwich with the remaining biscuits. Dip each of the chocolate sandwiches into the melted chocolate, then place on a tray lined with baking paper until set. Serve with a nice hot cup of tea.

Papua New Guinea authorities have re-entered the mothballed detention centre on Manus Island and cleared the facility of all asylum seekers and refugees, end the weeks-long standoff inside.

About 350 men were inside the centre on Friday, after weeks of protest following the closure of the camp. The men -- a mix of asylum seekers and refugees -- maintain alternate accommodation is not ready and not safe. PNG authorities cut food, water and electricity to the site two weeks ago.

Video from inside the centre on Friday appeared to show PNG police hitting seated refugees with long metal poles.

SBS News reported on Friday afternoon that police had successfully cleared the centre of inhabitants, and transported them to new facilities elsewhere on the island.

"They've moved out of the camp," a spokesman for the Royal PNG Constabulary told SBS News.

"Nobody was forced, nobody was handcuffed and so on."

Reports from refugees in the centre claimed police had confiscated phones and dealt injuries to the men.

Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton said the government "welcomes this development" that the refugees had been moved from the old facility.

"Food services, cleaning, security and the ELRTC-medical clinic are all operational and have been available since October 31," Dutton said in a statement, claiming that refugees advocates had made "inaccurate and exaggerated claims of violence and injuries".

"What is clear is that there has been an organised attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities. The Australian Government has been advised that some equipment has been sabotaged at the alternative accommodation centres, including damage to backup generators. Vandalism has also occurred to water infrastructure."

"The equipment is being repaired or replaced and the Government understands these matters are under investigation."

On Thursday police entered the camp and briefly detained journalist and asylum seeker Behrouz Boochani.

Immigration minister Peter Dutton and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have been unmoved by the mens' plight, weeks after Australia ceased operating the Manus camp which was set up as part of its regional immigration processing scheme.

Dutton welcomed the latest development, but lashed out at advocates supporting the men, accusing them of making "inaccurate and exaggerated" claims of violence and injuries on Manus.

"What is clear is that there has been an organised attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities," Dutton said in a statement.

"The Australian Government has been advised that some equipment has been sabotaged at the alternative accommodation centres, including damage to backup generators. Vandalism has also occurred to water infrastructure."

He said equipment is being repaired or replaced, and the Government understands these matters are under investigation.

"Advocates should now desist from holding out false hope to these men that they will ever be brought to Australia," he said, urging them to engage with PNG authorities for resettlement either through the US resettlement process or in PNG.

The centre has been controversial from the start, with numerous rights agencies speaking out about the conditions at the centre.

President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, may be moving to cooperate with the special counsel investigating ties between the Trump campaign and efforts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, The New York Times reported Thursday.

Lawyers for Flynn have reportedly stopped sharing information about special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing probe with the White House, a move the Times notes could signal Flynn's cooperation with the investigation or that he is in the process of negotiating some sort of legal deal. Flynn's lawyers had been cooperating with Trump's legal team, as defence teams often do, but recently notified the White House they could no longer discuss the investigation.

Such a move isn't a definite sign Flynn is negotiating some sort of agreement. The Times report was based on information from four people familiar with the case, whose identities could not be revealed as they aren't authorized to speak publicly.

Flynn resigned from the Trump's administration in February after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He has long had associations with Russia and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner in Moscow in 2015.

NBC News reported this month that Mueller's team had enough evidence to bring charges against Flynn and his son, Michael G. Flynn, who served as his father's chief of staff during the campaign.

The elder Flynn had previously signaled that he would not cooperate with a Senate intelligence committee investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in May. But the Times notes he may move to work with Mueller in an effort to save his son.

His cooperation would provide insight about Trump's campaign and his early days in the White House.

Mueller's probe snagged its first targets last month, when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Richard Gates, were indicted on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. Both have pleaded not guilty.-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/shirleene-robinson/how-the-yes-campaign-was-successful_a_23286756/How The YES Campaign Was Successful"The creative team produced a total of 141 videos during the campaign period. All up, they were viewed a staggering 18.8 million times."

The most inspiring and important element of the successful YES campaign was the involvement of so many people, from many different backgrounds, right across the country. It was those people who gave up so much of their time, were active in their own communities, made phone calls, knocked on doors and had conversations explaining why marriage equality matters.

Their incredible efforts have moved us closer to a fairer and more equal Australia by making sure millions of Australians posted their YES vote.

It was crucial that those people who were campaigning for a YES result felt supported and connected, no matter where they were located. One of the key ways they were able to access information and assistance was through the Internet.

This week, we talked to Adam Knobel, Digital Campaign Director at the Equality Campaign, who told us about the way digital was able to help bring Australians together. He was keen to emphasise digital campaigners worked in close collaboration with video producers, field campaigners and so many others -- and that the success of the YES campaign really did come down to the extraordinary efforts of millions of everyday Australians.

As we reflect back on the campaign, it is wonderful to think that the internet was able to provide a means to reach so many people.

Since 2004, the marriage equality campaign has been driven by people from every part of Australia, a continent vast in size, making physical contact between all campaigners impossible. As the movement for marriage equality has grown, so too has the potential for digital communication through the internet.

Marriage equality campaigners have been quick to harness this potential; working to tell their story online, recruit and activate new volunteers and support each other through peer-to-peer messaging. This was a decentralised campaign, driven by people all across the country taking grassroots action in their own community. Digital allowed supporters to find information and resources needed to support action.

During the survey one of the first tasks the digital team had was to make sure as many Australians as possible were on the electoral roll before the cut-off date, so they were able to have their say in shaping a fairer Australia.

By working in collaboration with partner organisations, particularly youth organisations like Oaktree, AYCC and the National Union of Students, campaigners were successful in getting young people enrolled. Indeed, there are now more people on the electoral roll than at any other time in Australian history.

Campaigners also had to convey to Australians just how important it was to return their ballots. Postal surveys on issues such as marriage are unprecedented and it was impossible to predict how Australians would respond.

However, the final return rate of 79.5 percent shows just how successful this campaign was. Digital campaigners were also able to connect with YES voting Australians overseas, making sure they knew they were able to play their part, even though they were away from home.

Campaigners knew it was crucial that people had access to accurate information that would address the misdirection and untruths that sadly came to characterise the NO campaign. They also knew that it was important to emphasise what this vote was really about -- the dignity and equality of fellow Australians.

Adam told us that he worked with a great team, including a very strong field team and an exceptional group of communications and creative talent, who knew that it was important to tell the stories of those affected by the lack of marriage equality in this country.

One of the stories captured by the creative team that touched so many was that of Peter de Waal and Peter Bonsall-Boone. Together for 50 years, these men desperately wanted to have their relationship recognised through marriage. Sadly, Bonn was very sick and died waiting for marriage equality. This personal story of a love that endured has opened the hearts of millions of Australians.

Peter & Bon were a loving couple for over 50 yrs. Sadly, Bon lost his fight to cancer. His hope was to see Australia #VoteYespic.twitter.com/0u9O52eLUk — AU Marriage Equality (@AMEquality) September 18, 2017

Another video produced by the creative team, which showed Lisa ringing her grandmother to ask for her support and her YES vote, also moved many Australians -- and kicked off a successful action to 'ring your rellos'. This video showed just how powerful conversations and personal contact can be.

Here's what happens when Lisa calls her Grandma. ☎️#RingYourRellos and talk to them about why you're voting YES for Marriage Equality. pic.twitter.com/AS6nljt6te — AU Marriage Equality (@AMEquality) September 6, 2017

The creative team produced a total of 141 videos during the campaign period. Digital platforms such as Facebook provided an ideal outlet to show these important videos. All up, they were viewed a staggering 18.8 million times.

There are a number of other important ways that digital campaigning was vital to YES vote during the survey. A successful crowdfunding campaign managed to raise $100,000 so that the popular 'Bachelor and Bachelorette' clip could be aired on television.

Every Bachelor & Bachelorette deserves their happy ending. Vote YES for #MarriageEquality. #TheBachelorAUhttps://t.co/5U71pnoY5z — AU Marriage Equality (@AMEquality) September 14, 2017

This was really important as the NO side outspent YES by a substantial amount. Digital was able to reach likely YES voters up to seven times over a three-week period with reminders to post their YES, through highly effective targeted online advertising.

As we reflect back on the campaign, it is wonderful to think that the internet was able to provide a means to reach so many people and to provide them with the resources they needed to conduct their individual campaigns. It is also powerful to realise just how many people worked tirelessly to try and shape a fairer country.

The vote might now be over with a YES result returned in every Australian state and territory. However, Parliament has still to deliver marriage equality.

Until it does, the digital and creative team at the Equality campaign will keep doing all they can to emphasise just why marriage equality matters so deeply. Importantly, we know that millions of Australian people will be doing the same.1

While Canadians embrace these traditions whole-heartedly -- especially when it comes to culinary delights -- they also cherish many not so well known delicacies. Canucks are truly unique, and so are their palates.

London Fog

A post shared by earnesticecream (@earnesticecream) on Mar 19, 2017 at 2:08pm PDT

While it could also double as a great cocktail name, the London Fog is in fact a type of hot drink.

Made up of Earl Grey tea, milk and vanilla syrup, this steamy concoction originated in Vancouver, however its creator still remains a mystery.

London Fogs can be found in most cafés across Canada. However, if you're after the flavours with a twist, Vancouver based ice cream connoisseurs, Earnest Ice Cream, have created a London Fog gelato version that is out of this world, according to Gastrofork blogger Dee Los Santos.

Bannock

A post shared by Salmon n'Bannock Bistro (@salmonnbannockbistro) on Mar 26, 2017 at 12:41am PDT

A type of flat bread, Bannock takes its name from the traditional Scottish bun but was adopted by the Metis and Franco Canadians.

This Canadian delicacy is traditionally served over the campfire or with a big bowl of split pea soup! VanFoodies blogger Joyce Lam recommends Duchess' Bannock and Desserts in Alert Bay, BC for their delicious and generous portions.

Foodology blogger Diana Chan also recommends Salmon n' Bannock in Vancouver, famous for its bannocks.

Donairs

A post shared by King of Donair (@kingofdonair) on Sep 1, 2017 at 4:27pm PDT

Dubbed Canada's answer to the Greek Gyros, Donairs are famous in The Maritimes and certainly centred in the city of Halifax.

Touted as the city's official snack, Donairs are a pita filled with spit roasted shaved beef, tomatoes and onions slathered in a signature sauce. Legend has it that the Halifax Donair originates from a restaurant owner, Peter Gamoulakos back in the 1970s.

It's understood that his original 'gyros' didn't quite fit with the East coast cuisine, but a tweak of the recipe and voila! Halifax's famous dish was born. Peppers & Pennies food blogger Amanda Cortens recommends King of Donair and Tony's Donair for a fix.

Ice Wine

A post shared by Ape to Gentleman (@apetogentleman) on Sep 19, 2017 at 2:59pm PDT

Making the most of their frosty climate, Canadians love a good ice wine!

This dessert wine is produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine. The sugars within the grape do not freeze, but the water does, creating a more concentrated, sweet wine.

The Inniskillin Winery, based in Niagara-on-the-lake, Ontario, is believed to have created the first ice-wine in 1984 -- a Vidal labelled 'Eiswein'. Lam recommended Peller Estate in Niagara Falls. They're also incidentally one of the biggest producers of Ice Wine in Canada. Los Santos recommended award-winning Summerhill Pyramid Winery, based in Kelowna, British Columbia.

Nanaimo Bars

A post shared by Nanaimo Bars The Original (@nanaimobarstheoriginal) on Mar 9, 2017 at 12:24am PST

This three-layered treat consisting of a wafer crumb base, custard butter icing and melted chocolate is the pride and joy of Nanaimo, British Columbia.

Local legend has it that it originated from a woman called Mabel Jenkins, who submitted the recipe to a public cookbook in the 1950s. Chan recommended Whistler and Vancouver based handmade bakery, PureBread, for their Nanaimo Bars. Of course, it's definitely worth trying one from their namesake city, and Bocca Café in Nanaimo is touted as one of the best.

Beavertails

A post shared by BeaverTails (@beavertails_official) on Sep 4, 2017 at 7:39am PDT

Deep fried pastry topped with cinnamon and sugar, chocolate or maple butter, say no more!

Beavertails were first introduced in 1978 by husband and wife team, Grant and Pam Hooker, in Ottawa, Ontario. Now, they are the sole producers of Beavertails™ in Canada. The whole-wheat pastry is stretched out, resembling the shape of a beaver's tail -- hence the name. Beavertails are sold across Canada, namely at markets, theme parks and ski resorts!

Saskatoon Berries

A post shared by Paula Wilson (@paulawilson19) on Sep 4, 2017 at 3:34pm PDT

While they closely resemble a blueberry, Saskatoon berries offer a far more unique flavour. Originating from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, these zesty berries can be found in the Canadian Prairies and pack a nutritional punch. Each berry contains a significant dose of manganese, magnesium, iron, calcium, potassium, fibre, protein and antioxidants!

Cortens said Saskatoon berries are mostly used in jams and pies and recommended trying them at the Berry Barn, in Saskatoon.

Moose

A post shared by Mandy Leigh (@mandyleighheit) on Apr 30, 2017 at 5:18pm PDT

Steak, Lamb, Chicken -- step aside. If you're a Canadian Northerner (very Game Of Thrones we know), then there's a good chance you spent most of your childhood living off the land -- AKA, eating moose.

80Twenty food blogger, Kris Osborne said that while moose meat can be hard to find in stores, there's other ways of getting your hands on it. "If you befriend a northerner, you're bound to be invited over for a meal at some point," Osborne said.

In terms of how to eat it, Osborne said cooking moose meat slowly simmered with onions and green peppers and served over potatoes is nothing short of amazing.

A poll earlier this month showed public support for Theresa May had grown despite a disastrous party conference speech, two Cabinet resignations and Brexit talks stalling. The YouGov poll for The Times found 34% of voters want May to stay as Prime Minister, up one point from a month ago. Backing for Jeremy Corbyn as PM, meanwhile, fell two points to 35% and a sizeable 35% said they were not sure who they wanted to lead the country. Yet there were no signs of support for Corbyn waning at his first rally since just before the Labour party conference in September.

There was the landslide victory for the Tories and all that, so I’m not really concerning myself with polls, to be honest.” The young women, who told HuffPost UK they had dressed in red especially for the event, said they were optimistic about the future of the party.

Marcie Winstanley, 18, their fellow student who herself hopes to one day be a Labour MP, said: “I think the energy that was here tonight is going to be alive in all of the people who leave this room with newfound inspiration.” The trio weren’t the only ones dressed for the occasion. There were plenty of football-style scarves with Corbyn’s name emblazoned upon them floating around, as well a plenty of other merchandise, including the now-almost iconic T-shirt featured the leader’s name in the style of the Nike slogan. Peter Griffiths, a 69-year-old Labour councillor, also had little for time polls suggesting Corbyn was losing support. He said: “It’s not what we’re finding on the streets. When we go door-knocking, people are very much with Jeremy.” He too said he was optimistic about the future: “We are, we certainly are in the Midlands here about a very good result in the next round of elections.” Tom England, 27, has been a member of the party since Corbyn became a major figure. He was thrilled with the Labour leader’s furious response to Wednesday’s budget, when he attacked the absence of social care from Philip Hammond’s financial priorities.

Sarah Ann Harris/HuffPost UK There was plenty of Labour merchandise on display at the rally

The 27-year-old said he admired Corbyn’s “righteous anger”, adding: “It’s really encouraging, because he speaks sense and speaks personally and with compassion. It’s unusual to hear people speak with compassion, it’s really nice.” He told HuffPost: “It’s the first rally I’ve been to and it’s encouraging to see it’s quite diverse. You’re told that the swelling membership is young people but actually coming here, young people are still in the minority. I suppose compared to other political parties, there’s an awful lot of people here but it’s still very clear that it’s a movement across generations.” He hit out at “establishment” figures such as Tony Blair for talking Corbyn down. He said: “I saw Tony Blair talking about him and it kind of pissed me off because he was saying he should be further ahead and coming from somebody who lost the trust of the general public, it seems like a rather strange thing to do. “So I don’t think Jeremy Corbyn is hoped generally by people speaking out against him when they’ve got no real right to be speaking out against him. establishment figures speak out against him a lot but actually if you speak to the general public,I think he’s quite favourably viewed. “His authenticity is looked upon favourably even if you disagree with his views.” The biggest cheers of the nights were reserved for the issues of council housing, reversal of NHS privatisation and party successes in locations not generally thought of as Labour areas.

The Telegraph reports that while May will confirm her offer to increase our divorce bill payments, the EU is playing hardball and insisting on written guarantees. There’s word too that May could have a bilateral meeting with Angela Merkel in the margins of today’s meeting.

The day after our own Budget forecast gloom, the FT reports that the eurozone economy powered ahead in November, with 17-year highs in new manufacturing orders and jobs growth. And Irish broadcaster RTE has a leaked document showing EU officials think the UK’s Brexit negotiations have been chaotic and incoherent, branding Boris Johnson ‘unimpressive’. Ian Forrester, the British judge on the European Court of Justice for the past two years, candidly told Irish diplomats that there were “issues around the quality of politicians in Westminster at present” and that ministers still don’t ‘grasp’ the complexity of quitting the EU.

Michael Gove was on the Today programme and was very reluctant to confirm the Cabinet had agreed to up its financial offer, stating only that “I think the Prime Minister has the right negotiating stance”. But the Sun reports that Gove has won a Cabinet battle with Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd to allow the UK to make a ‘clean break’ with EU regulations even in a transitional period. A Cabinet source told the paper: “We’ll be bringing EU regulations into UK law when we leave, but thereafter we’ll want to diverge. We won’t be rule takers. The Prime Minister is now of that view, along with Michael and Boris.” The words ‘thereafter’ and ‘want to’ could be crucial. Many ministers believe ‘divergence’ will be more theoretical than actual for two years, just as our new ‘control’ over immigration may still see roughly the same numbers coming into the UK. The exact terms of the transition itself is a whole other battle due to be waged early in the New Year, but shots have been fired by the Brexiteers.

International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is another who wants more flexibility during a transition/implementation period. And today he has built on his previous complaint that some British firms had become “too lazy and too fat” within the comfy confines of EU. He tells The House magazine: “I can agree as many trade agreements as I like, but if British business doesn’t want to export, then that doesn’t do us any good.” The DUP’s annual conference takes place tomorrow and will see more journos present than ever before. But anyone expecting swivel-eyed, angry Ulstermen talking about social issues like abortion and gay rights are likely to be disappointed. A hard line on Brexit, in Gove and Fox style, could be the main story.0

It’s unusual to hear people speak with compassion, it’s really nice.” He told HuffPost: “It’s the first rally I’ve been to and it’s encouraging to see it’s quite diverse. You’re told that the swelling membership is young people but actually coming here, young people are still in the minority. I suppose compared to other political parties, there’s an awful lot of people here but it’s still very clear that it’s a movement across generations.” He hit out at “establishment” figures such as Tony Blair for talking Corbyn down. He said: “I saw Tony Blair talking about him and it kind of pissed me off because he was saying he should be further ahead and coming from somebody who lost the trust of the general public, it seems like a rather strange thing to do. “So I don’t think Jeremy Corbyn is hoped generally by people speaking out against him when they’ve got no real right to be speaking out against him. establishment figures speak out against him a lot but actually if you speak to the general public,I think he’s quite favourably viewed. “His authenticity is looked upon favourably even if you disagree with his views.” The biggest cheers of the nights were reserved for the issues of council housing, reversal of NHS privatisation and party successes in locations not generally thought of as Labour areas.

The video, created with the National Police LGBT+ Network, covers everything from a basic definition of what “transgender” means to how you should address someone if you’re not sure which pronoun they use. It follows research conducted earlier this year, which found that more than half of trans employees (53%) in the UK have felt the need to hide their trans status from employers.

Members of Leicestershire Police came up with the film idea after seeing the widespread media coverage gender neutral police uniforms received earlier this year. They approached trans activists Fox Fisher and Owl, who run the not-for-profit trans awareness film company My Genderation, about bringing the project to life. “Given the history between the trans community and the police force, we realised that it was a sensitive matter,” the activists told HuffPost UK. “After giving it much consideration we came to the conclusion that this film would ultimately foster understanding about trans issues within the police and workplaces in general and have a positive effect and hopefully build some bridges. “This was an opportunity to work from within and hopefully create change.” The film features employees across multiple areas of police services, who share their own stories plus advice for creating trans inclusive workplaces. Police sergeant Gina provides tips on using pronouns in the workplace when unsure, saying: “If possible, ask somebody their preferred pronouns. ‘They’ or ‘them’ would work really well if you’re not sure.” Meanwhile Megan, who works as an equality officer within the probation service, explains the importance of not “outing” someone who is transgender to others if they have told you in confidence, or you have heard the information from someone else. “It’s actually a criminal offence in a professional capacity to tell somebody that somebody else is transgender,” Megan says in the film. “Some people transition and just want to live their life as quietly as anybody else in the gender that they know themselves to be, so by outing somebody, you could put a serious risk to their mental health, their physical health, and it might lead to something really, really serious.”

Trudeau told Motherboard on Wednesday that the Trump administration’s plan to repeal net neutrality “does not make sense.”

“I am very concerned about the attacks on net neutrality,” Trudeau said. “Net neutrality is something that is essential for small businesses, for consumers, and it is essential to keep the freedom associated with the internet alive.”

He added that he’ll look into ways to defend net neutrality for the internet as a whole.

Speaking at the Global Conference on Cyberspace held in New Delhi on Thursday, India’s minister of law and justice, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said that “right of access” to the internet should be “non-negotiable.”

“Internet is supposed to be democratic. It is a big global platform, but must be linked the local ideas and concepts,” Prasad said, according to The Indian Express.

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also attended the event, similarly expressed his support for net neutrality, saying that the protection “lowers the barriers of entry by preserving the internet as a fair and level playing field and helps businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive online.”

“Open internet facilitates the marginalized and oppressed segments that are not adequately represented in the mainstream media, to tell their stories and to mobilize justice, as we have seen in recent times,” he added.

In the U.S., tech giants including Facebook, Google, Reddit and Netflix have expressed their disappointment and opposition to the FCC’s plan.

Netflix supports strong #NetNeutrality. We oppose the FCC's proposal to roll back these core protections. — Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2017

Opponents of net neutrality, including Comcast, AT&T and Verizon ― which owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath ― have also been vocal, arguing that services such as Netflix that use more bandwidth should have to pay more.

On Wednesday, a top FCC official urged the American public to “stop us from killing net neutrality.”-1

A man fleeing police "deliberately ran down" Deputy Eric Overall, 50, who had just put down "stop sticks" to try to slow the suspect's vehicle.

After the vehicle struck the deputy, it flipped over and the 22-year-old suspect was taken into custody, the sheriff's office said.

The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, and said Overall died of blunt force trauma.

"Deputy Overall was not in the roadway at the time, and in fact was well off the roadway, and he had just deployed the 'Stop Sticks' across SB M-15. It is our belief that from all evidence collected that the suspect deliberately ran down Deputy Overall, swerving to hit him," said a statement from the sheriff's office.

The deputy had been assisting the Lapeer County Sheriff's Office on a pursuit that had started in Lapeer County, the statement said. The suspect had made threats at the Lapeer County Sheriff's Office headquarters and took off, prompting the chase, according to the sheriff's office.

http://cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/john-conyers-michigan-sexual-harassment-allegations/index.htmlGetting rid of John Conyers won't be easy(CNN) Michigan Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat, continues to battle allegations of sexual harassment, accusations first made public in reporting by BuzzFeed on Monday. On Tuesday night, the Detroit Free Press editorial board called on Conyers to resign ; "He should resign his position and allow the investigation into his behavior to unfold without the threat that it would render him, and the people he now represents, effectively voiceless," the editorial board wrote.

So, will Conyers take that advice? Or will he try to weather the storm? I reached out to the Detroit Free Press' Todd Spangler for answers to those questions. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.

Cillizza: How are the Conyers's sexual harassment charges playing among his fellow Michigan members -- and the broader populace of the state?

Spangler: So far, there hasn't been much of any reaction from Republican members of the Michigan delegation -- and they take up 9 of the 14 seats. I'm guessing that part of the reason for that is a) It's a holiday week and they're busy with their families, etc., and b) Roy Moore. You go after Conyers too hard at this point or try to link Democrats with him and you might find that finger pointing back at yourself.

Among Democrats, the reaction has been stronger, with just about a unanimous call for an ethics investigation. I haven't come across anyone who doesn't support that -- including the Michigan Democratic Party, which went the extra step to note not only the sexual harassment accusations but the prospect that office funds might have been misused in the settlement. That suggests the party might take a very tough line on this going forward and any lingering support for Conyers could evaporate quickly. No one wants to be seen as defending him at this point, it seems.

What's also clear is that just below the surface -- and in some cases out in the open -- there is a feeling among some Democratic pundits, consultants, etc., that Conyers should go and go quickly, that his hanging around while this gets sorted out -- and with the possibility of more accusers coming forward -- doesn't do the party any good heading into midterms . But I don't know of any members of Congress saying that out loud.

Numerically speaking by the way, there's no downside to his leaving. Conyers' seat is one of the most Democratic districts in the nation and it's not going to flip.

Cillizza: Conyers is widely known as the longest serving member of the House. Beyond that, how is he regarded in DC and Michigan?

Spangler: He's a real enigma in terms of reputation. African Americans in Detroit and I believe across the nation see him as a long-time civil rights champion, someone who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and employed Rosa Parks when she moved to Detroit -- and [someone who] has fought for more than 50 years in Congress to improve civil rights. I mean, he's renowned. The Congressional Black Caucus counts him as a founder and has been a huge supporter, helping to keep him atop the Judiciary Committee. But there are also many people who believe that he should have retired long ago, that he's not as sharp as he once was, and that the ethical questions that have been raised in this and other instances have damaged him.

There is also his wife, Monica, a former city councilwoman in Detroit who did prison time for accepting bribes . Her behavior -- which has been boorish at times -- has reflected very badly on Conyers, who kept his distance from her legal troubles but also has refused to criticize her in public. In fact, he really won't talk about her in any way, shape or form. But there is no question that she has hurt his reputation.

One other thing about the regard people hold him in: There is no dearth of people who would like to see Conyers go and vie for that seat. A few have even tried to knock him off. But the Conyers brand is so strong none have really come close. So as far as his constituents go, he's their guy. That might be a factor in whether he stays or goes.

Cillizza: Is this news about Conyers truly "new"? Or has there been chatter about it before? If the latter, why is it only coming to light now?

Spangler: I think in all fairness to Conyers, chatter overall is pretty rampant on the Hill and that it wouldn't be right for reporters to throw that kind of gossip up as news without a strict vetting regarding any member of Congress. You hear all kinds of things after all -- but no, it's not the first time I've heard an allegation of some kind or other about something going on in Conyers' (or someone else's) office. The distinction here is that documents which are usually kept completely under wraps and secret -- the complaint and unsigned settlement by the woman who worked for him, the affidavits from other women workers in the office -- was entirely new and that : I think in all fairness to Conyers, chatter overall is pretty rampant on the Hill and that it wouldn't be right for reporters to throw that kind of gossip up as news without a strict vetting regarding any member of Congress. You hear all kinds of things after all -- but no, it's not the first time I've heard an allegation of some kind or other about something going on in Conyers' (or someone else's) office. The distinction here is that documents which are usually kept completely under wraps and secret -- the complaint and unsigned settlement by the woman who worked for him, the affidavits from other women workers in the office -- was entirely new and that BuzzFeed, to their credit, got them and, more importantly, vetted them with the people involved.

Again, though, in fairness to Conyers: This settlement that was published by BuzzFeed expressly denied the claims made against him and the woman who accused him signed it. She may have done so because she felt she had no other choice, that this was as much justice as she was going to get from this closed-door system of dealing with harassment complaints, but at no point has Conyers acknowledged he did anything wrong.

Cillizza: Conyers denies that he harassed anyone. So far Democratic leadership isn't calling on him to resign. How long does that last?

Spangler: I have every reason to believe that behind the scenes he is probably being pushed in that direction, though I don't know by whom or how strongly. Certainly, I don't think he's going to be able to count on much party help going forward or, you know, Barack Obama to endorse him again in his next election.

But I also have every reason to believe that 88-year-old John Conyers is going to be a very hard rock to move: He's had his share of challenges, politically, ethically, etc., over the years and he's still sitting there. This guy was part of the committee vote to impeach Nixon! He knew King personally. I think he has a great ability to put his head down and not let criticism get to him, to tune it out. I don't think he's going to just look at it and say, "That's it, I'm done. This is too hard."

I think the real measure of this will be the level of support -- or lack of it -- that he gets from other African American leaders, especially those in the Congressional Black Caucus. If that group were to abandon him, call for his resignation, then he might feel like it's the end. Likewise, if somehow Democrats were to move to strip him of his spot as ranking member of Judiciary -- which has already been talked about in recent years (though, again, there he sits). The counterweight to that, however, is that he may want to beat John Dingell's longevity record in Congress -- and for that he'd have to serve six more years.

Cillizza: Finish this sentence: "By Christmas, John Conyers will be ______________." Now, explain.

Spangler: Predictions aren't my strong suit. But I think he'll still be in office, planning his annual trip to the Super Bowl, unless there are widespread calls among Democratic officials and respected black leaders -- John Lewis, Barack Obama -- say that it's time for him to go. And even then he might say, to hell with it, let them force me out. My gut tells me he'll probably lawyer up -- this guy has been on the Judiciary Committee a loooong time after all, he knows a lot of lawyers -- and try to ride this out. But I could be wrong.-1
http://time.com/5036327/oscar-pistorius-murder-sentence-extended-reeva-steenkamp/?xid=homepageOscar Pistorius' Murder Sentence Extended to 13 Years(SOMERSET WEST, South Africa) — Oscar Pistorius’ prison sentence was increased to 13 years and five months by South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday, a decision that more than doubled the Olympic runner’s jail term for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

In an announcement that took a matter of minutes, Supreme Court Justice Willie Seriti said the Supreme Court upheld an appeal by prosecutors against Pistorius’ original six-year sentence for shooting Steenkamp multiple times in his home in 2013.

Prosecutors had called that six-year sentence “shockingly” lenient.

Pistorius should have been sentenced to the prescribed minimum of 15 years for murder in South Africa, Seriti said, as he delivered the verdict that was reached by a panel of five judges at the Supreme Court in the central city of Bloemfontein.

The new sentence of 13 years and five months took into account time Pistorius had already served in prison and at home under house arrest, Seriti said.

Pistorius, who turned 31 on Wednesday, has served over a year of his initial six-year sentence.

Pistorius killed Steenkamp in the pre-dawn hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 after shooting four times through a closed toilet cubicle door in his home. Claiming he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder, he was initially convicted of manslaughter. That conviction was overturned and replaced with a murder conviction by the Supreme Court in 2015.

Friday’s decision likely brings an end to a near five-year legal saga surrounding the double-amputee athlete, a multiple Paralympic champion and record-breaker who was once one of the most celebrated sportsmen in the world.

Pistorius’ lawyers have just one avenue open to them if they want to challenge the new sentence handed down by the Supreme Court, and that is to appeal to the Constitutional Court, the highest court in South Africa.

Pistorius failed with an appeal to the Constitutional Court last year to challenge his murder conviction.-1
http://time.com/4780307/sally-yates-donald-trump-russia-mike-flynn-cnn-interview/?xid=homepageSally Yates Warns Russians Had ‘Real Leverage’ on Michael FlynnFormer acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by President Donald Trump, warned that the Russians had “real leverage” on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Yates said Flynn was in a “serious compromise situation, that the Russians had real leverage.” When asked if Flynn’s actions were illegal, she said there was “certainly a criminal statute that was implicated by his conduct” and that Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence.

“We expected the White House to act,” Yates said, adding that they should have done so quickly.

Before her first on-camera interview since being dismissed from the Trump Administration, Yates testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism. She discussed Flynn’s contact with the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. before Trump himself took office.

Yates warned the Trump Administration about Flynn 17 days before he was fired.

“Whether he is fired or not is a decision by the President of the United States to make, but it doesn’t seem like that’s the person who should be sitting in the National Security Adviser position,” she told CNN.

Yates also told Cooper she had never leaked any classified information to the media — countering a claim Trump made in a tweet earlier this month. When asked about that tweet, Yates responded, “There have been a number of tweets that have given me pause.”

Trump fired Yates in January after she refused to defend his administration’s first iteration of the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries.-1

Losses were seen in automakers and manufacturing names. Technology stocks were a mixed picture: Nintendo rose 3.55 percent, SoftBank Group gained 1.4 percent and Sharp was down 1.26 percent by the end of the day.

Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi tacked on 0.28 percent to end at 2,544.33, with tech heavyweight Samsung Electronics gaining 0.29 percent. Financials drifted slightly lower.

Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.06 percent to close at 5,982.55. The industrials and information technology sub-indexes fell 0.42 percent and 0.74 percent respectively by the end of the session.

In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite eked out gains of 0.06 percent to close at 3,353.82 after trading in negative territory earlier in the day. The index finished the week 1.14 percent lower. The Shenzhen Composite meanwhile lost 0.09 percent to end at 1,922.72, closing the week down 2.5 percent. The blue-chip CSI 300 index, which suffered its largest one-day fall since June 2016 on Thursday, closed higher by 0.04 percent after choppy trade.

Insurers closed mostly lower, although banks and brokerages finished the session mixed. Airlines finished the session with significant gains, with China Eastern Airlines rising 4.98 percent on the day.

A combination of tighter rules for online micro-lenders and firmer bond prices were seen as reasons for the declines on Thursday. Stocks hit by the recent sell-off had in fact risen in the past weeks and still boasted relatively good fundamentals, according to market watchers. "There was panic selling in the market," said Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital International.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fared better in comparison, climbing 0.54 percent by 3:25 p.m. HK/SIN after closing 1 percent lower on Thursday. Still, the index remained below the 30,000 mark that it topped for the first time in a decade earlier this week.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/23/north-korea-economy-china-sanctions-pressure-kim-jong-un.htmlNorth Korea still has plenty of options as it faces new sanctions and a frosty BeijingWhen the world has been tough on Pyongyang, leaders in the reclusive state have long turned to allies in Beijing to alleviate their troubles. But that relationship is showing signs of fraying.

China makes up more than 80 percent of North Korean trade and has been credited for holding up the regime, but analysts say that China has become more assertive this year in exercising pressure on its ally.

Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul and a specialist in Korean Studies, wrote on Monday that there is an "ongoing U-turn in China's North Korean policy."

He cited strong Chinese support for "the toughest" United Nations Security Council-approved resolution ever on the North Korean issue — an action which he said surprised many observers, including him.

He added that Chinese policymakers and scholars are now saying that "China has had enough and should switch to a tougher policy."

Over the last week, China deployed a special envoy to North Korea for the first time since February last year. China-watchers deemed the four-day trip as important, but its consequences were not immediately apparent.

For its part, North Korea is likely to be feeling the effects of China's new approach.

China released figures last month showing that its fuel exports to North Korea fell sharply in September. Imports of North Korean coal was down 71.6 percent from last year, while exports of petrol were down 99.6 percent.-1

The South Korean and U.S. soldiers who led a rescue attempt to drag the gravely injured solider to safety have been awarded medals, according to U.S. Forces Korea.

A group of senior diplomats based in Seoul visited the JSA on Wednesday morning where they saw five North Korean workers digging a deep trench in the area where the soldier had dashed across the line after getting his jeep stuck in a small ditch, a member of the diplomatic delegation told Reuters on Friday.

In a photograph of the visit posted to the Twitter account of acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Marc Knapper, North Korean workers could be seen using shovels to dig a deep trench on the North Korean side of the line as soldiers stood guard.

"The workers were being watched very closely by the KPA guards, not just the two in the photo, but others out of shot behind the building," said the diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.

According to an intelligence official cited by South Korea's Yonhap news agency, the North has replaced the 35-40 soldiers it had guarding the JSA at the time of the incident.

"We're closely monitoring the North Korean military's movement in the JSA," a South Korean defense ministry official told reporters, without confirming the reduction in border guards. "There are limits as to what we can say about things we know."-1

Samantha Cox, a 24-year-old teacher at Lake Central High School in the town of St. John near the Illinois border, was arrested on Wednesday for possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia.

The English teacher was allegedly caught doing drugs after students filmed her with a phone from outside the classroom, according to Fox 32 Chicago.

"It's absolutely, I can't' really describe it. It's just atrocious," Kasia Firlej, a parent of a child at the school said to the local news channel.

The video, which made rounds on social media, shows a woman alleged to be Cox sitting in the corner of the classroom using narcotics. It was not immediately clear which substance she was taking.

Police in St. John responded to a call late Wednesday morning about the situation.

A second cellphone video shows the teacher being led out of the school wearing handcuffs.

The incident led Lake Central superintendent, Dr. Larry Verraco, to send out a recorded message on Wednesday afternoon to parents.

"Earlier today, Lake Central administration was made aware of a situation regarding a teacher at Lake Central High School,” Dr.Verraco said in the message. “Swift and forceful action was taken in conjunction with St. John and Dyer police departments. The safety of all students remains the top priority of our school staff and a full investigation is ongoing."

Cox is being held at a local jail pending charges.

The investigation is ongoing.

Shoppers are expected to spend more than ever before during the coming weeks -- an average of $967 each, according to the National Retail Federation. That's up 3% from last year.

But it's the first time that Americans plan to shop more online than in big box stores like Walmart (WMT) or Target.

It's been a terrible year for traditional retailers so far. Store closings have more than tripled to a record 6,700 and several prominent retailers such as Toys R Us, Gymboree, Payless Shoes and RadioShack have filed for bankruptcy.

According to reports in German media, the opposition party SPD say it's now open to coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Merkel has struggled to form a government since her election victory in late September -- and some fear another election could be required.

Meanwhile, a key measure of business confidence published by Germany's IFO hit a record high in November. A survey of Eurozone purchasing managers released Wednesday showed a sharp jump in business confidence and hiring at its highest level in 17 years.

Investors cheered the news. Germany's DAX jumped 0.2% and the euro gained against major currencies.

http://www.businessinsider.com/emmerson-mnangagwa-zimbabwe-president-robert-mugabe-successor-2017-11Emmerson Mnangagwa just became Zimbabwe's new president — here's how he went from Robert Mugabe’s bodyguard to his successorEmmerson Mnangagwa was sworn in as Zimbabwe's president on Friday.

Robert Mugabe fired him earlier this month to smooth the path to the presidency for his wife, Grace.

Mnangagwa and Mugabe's relationship goes back decades.

Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn is as Zimbabwe's president on Friday, officially ending Robert Mugabe's 37-year reign over the southern African country. Mnangagwa was fired from his role as Mugabe's vice president earlier this month, in an apparent attempt to pave the way for Mugabe's wife, Grace, to become Zimbabwe's next president. This is believed to be the reason behind the country's military coup last week. Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe on Wednesday after Mugabe's resignation the day before, which prompted celebrations in the country's parliament and on the streets of Harare. But Mnangagwa's relationship with Mugabe wasn't always bad. In fact, he had served as the Mugabe's personal assistant and bodyguard, and occupied multiple senior political roles before becoming his vice president in 2014. Scroll down to learn more about him. View As: One Page Slides

This is Emmerson Mnangagwa, Robert Mugabe's former vice president and now successor. At 75 years old, he's 18 years younger than Mugabe, who is 93.

Mnangagwa was born in Zvishavane, a mining town in central Zimbabwe. As a child, he and his family were forced to flee to Zambia as his father became increasingly involved in the resistance movement against white settlers in the region. In Zambia, Emmerson Mnangagwa was expelled from school for his activism, The New York Times reported. He later received military training in China and Egypt, and attended the Beijing School of Ideology, according to the BBC. Decades on, he has maintained financial and professional links to China, and even sent one of his sons to study in the Asian country, The Guardian reported.

When Mnangagwa was 16, he was part of a group to blow up a train in what was then Rhodesia, a British colony. He was then sentenced to 10 years in prison, where he was tortured. His fellow plotters were summarily executed, but thanks to a priest's intervention, he was ordered to serve 10 years in prison instead, according to The New York Times. There he was tortured, which included being hanged by his feet, the BBC reported. The gruesome torture techniques he endured "made him unconscious for days" and resulted in his losing his hearing in one ear, the BBC said. According to the Times, Mnangagwa also devoted his time in prison to study, and obtained a law degree from the University of Zambia upon his release.

Mnangagwa then joined Zimbabwe's liberation movement in Mozambique in the 1970s, where he met Mugabe and became his personal assistant and bodyguard, according to The New York Times.

Mnangagwa also fought in Zimbabwe's liberation war in the 1970s, where he earned his nickname "The Crocodile," in reference to his time as a guerrilla fighter. In a 2015 interview with the London-based New African magazine, Mnangagwa also said of his nickname: "You know the trait of a crocodile, don't you? It never hunts outside water. It always goes into the water to catch its prey. It never goes in the villages or in the bush looking for food. It strikes at the appropriate time. "So a good guerrilla leader strikes at the appropriate time. That’s the importance of the nicknames we gave each other."

After Zimbabwe achieved independence in 1980, Mnangagwa occupied a series of high-profile positions under Mugabe before becoming his vice president in December 2014. From 1980 to 2014, he was Zimbabwe's National Security Minister, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Defence, among other posts.

The Mugabe-Mnangagwa relationship seemed to end earlier this month, when Mugabe fired Mnangagwa. It paved the way for Mugabe's wife, Grace, to ascend the Zimbabwean presidency. Mugabe even accused Mnangagwa of plotting against him with witchcraft. According to The Associated Press, the 93-year-old said: "People were told that I will retire in March but I did not. Upon realising that I wasn't, he [Mnangagwa] started consulting traditional healers on when I was going to die." Mugabe's accusations against Mnangagwa echoed those levelled against his predecessor, Joice Mujuru, who was also sacked and accused by Mugabe of using witchcraft to wrest control.

Mnangagwa fled to South Africa after being sacked, saying his security guards warned of plots to kill him, according to the BBC. After leaving Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa issued a statement from an unknown location that said, as cited by the AP: "I will be communicating with you soon and shall return to Zimbabwe to lead you." After the military coup took place a week later, Mnangagwa said, according to the BBC: "I told the President that I would not return home now until I am satisfied of my personal security, because of the manner and treatment given to me upon being fired." Upon Mnangagwa's arrival to Harare this Tuesday, supporters held up signs saying: "True to your word, you're back. Welcome!"

After Zimbabwe's military coup, Mnangagwa publicly called on Mugabe to resign. He also thanked the army for carrying out the "process" to remove Mugabe peacefully, according to the BBC. Mnangagwa has, however, assured Mugabe and his family of their security and welfare since the coup, Zimbabwe's state-owned newspaper The Herald reported on Friday. The two men also agreed that Mugabe would not attend Mnangagwa's inauguration because the ex-president "needed time to rest after the hectic events of the week-and-a-half."0

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/24/theresa-may-brussels-brexit-divorce-bill-offer-summitTheresa May pushes for Brexit talks progress as she arrives in BrusselsWith no sign of negotiations moving on to trade, PM prepares for EU summit and meeting with European council president

Theresa May has reiterated she is willing to lay down further money to meet the EU’s €60bn divorce bill demands only if the bloc’s leaders can guarantee the widening of talks to trade and the terms of a transition period.

The prime minister, speaking as she arrived at an EU summit in Brussels on Friday, will meet the president of the European council, Donald Tusk at the end of the meeting. She told reporters: “These negotiations are continuing but what I am clear about is that we must step forward together. This is for both the UK and the European Union to move on to the next stage.”

The British government’s irritation at the failure of May’s speech in Florence in September to move talks on to trade discussions has complicated the choreography of the next few days.

The UK’s negotiating team had been led to believe by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that a pledge to ensure no member state lost out in the first two years after Brexit, and to honour financial commitments made in the past, would be enough, only for Germany and France to overrule the European commission official.

At a meeting of the cabinet last week it was agreed that the UK would offer more than the €20bn put the table in Florence in the coming days, in an attempt to move the negotiations on from the opening issues of citizen’s rights, the divorce bill and the border on the island of Ireland. However, the agreement was struck on the proviso that the EU guaranteed progress on to a second phase of talks at a European council meeting on 14 and 15 December.

The EU member states, however, need to consult their national parliaments making such a guarantee, at the point at which the financial offer is made, almost impossible.

Q&A Why is Dublin opposed to the idea of a hard border? Show Hide Ireland’s new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has been much more sceptical than the UK about the potential for avoiding border posts via virtual checks on importers. Whilst agreeing with British ministers and EU negotiators that it is inconceivable for there to be a return to a hard border with the north, Dublin argues that the best way for the UK to achieve this would be by permanently remaining in a customs union with the EU and seeking single market membership like Norway through the European Economic Area. The UK has conceded that some of this will be necessary in its interim phase after Brexit, but hopes clever technological solutions can allow it have looser economic links in the long run. Varadkar is not alone in being sceptical about whether such a cake-and-eat-it customs and trade strategy is viable.

At a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, it is understood that concerns were shared by many member states if the stand-off continues for much longer that there will not be enough time to have an EU position by December.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, will need to present any offer to the Bundestag. The Scandinavian countries also have considerable domestic hurdles to leap before they can give their consent to judging that sufficient progress has been in made in phase one. As one one senior EU diplomat said: “The member states are not willing just to rubber-stamp an offer.”

The outstanding issue of the Irish government’s insistence that it needs to see tangible proposals from the British government on how they intend to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland is also proving a significant stumbling block in the negotiations.

The Irish want the UK in effect to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and the single market to avoid a hard border, a suggestion that has been rejected by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, as an affront to the constitution of the UK.

Arriving at the EU summit – where leaders are meeting their counterparts from Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia – the Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said Dublin would not accept “aspirational” commitments to avoid a hard border but they needed “parameters of a road map” to that outcome.

He also suggested that the British government had “not been listening” in past months to the Irish but that the 26 other member states and Barnier were firmly united behind the Irish if they wanted to hold talks back in December.

Coveney, who said he would be meeting Barnier at the summit, said: “We can’t move to phase two on the basis of aspiration. We have to move to phase two on the basis of a credible road map, or the parameters around which we can design a credible road map ... We need progress on this issue, in the context of the regulatory-divergence issue. And I hope and expect that we can get that by December so we can all move on. If we can’t, then I think there’s going to be difficulty moving on.”

According to Bloomberg, the British government has privately suggested that the Irish could be given a specific rolling veto on any deal at a later date, if they allow talks to move on now.

As well as Tusk, May will be holding bilateral meetings with the leaders of Lithuania, Belgium and Denmark.

Meanwhile, the Irish government appears to be at risk of collapse after the party, whose votes the prime minister, Leo Varadkar, depends on to pass legislation, said it would seek to remove the deputy prime minister in a breach of their co-operation agreement.

Coveney said: “Ireland does not need an election right now. There is no reason why Frances Fitzgerald should be forced to resign. The issues that are under discussion are under investigation by a tribunal we all agreed to set up.”

Referring to the Brexit negotiations, he added: “The main opposition party ... are risking an election at a time when there are some really, really serious issues for the government to manage in the national interests.”0

The Australian government has confirmed it is looking into the case of a 95-year-old Perth woman accused of looting artefacts from countries including Egypt.

Monica Hanna of Egypt’s Heritage Taskforce posted an open letter to Australia’s ambassador to Egypt, Neil Hawkins, on Facebook this month, alleging Joan Howard spent most of her time during her husband’s diplomatic trips looting archaeological sites.

Howard’s husband, Keith, held senior roles with the United Nations in the Middle East in the 1960s and 70s.

Hanna said Howard had taken advantage of her diplomatic status and her behaviour was “not acceptable”.

“I demand that an investigation should be carried out on the sources of Mrs Howard’s collection now in Perth,” she wrote

She shared a link to a Seven West Media story originally headlined “Indiana Joan and her trove of artefacts”, which described the former nurse as “WA’s real-life tomb raider”.

“There is a mischievous twinkle in the great-grandmother’s eye as she reveals why she has humbly kept quiet about her derring-do,” the article read.

“You don’t go round saying ‘I’ve been in a tomb’,” Howard said.

Hanna said the celebratory tone of the story sent a very negative message, especially given the large amount of looting of Egyptian archaeological sites in recent years.

“These activities decontextualise the cultural heritage and transforms the archaeological finds from historical objects to mere aesthetic artefacts,” she wrote.

“The illegal market leaves the Egyptian cultural heritage with holes that cannot be filled, and many stories that cannot be told about the past.”

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was investigating the matter and was obliged under Unesco conventions to return foreign cultural items that had been illegally exported from their country of origin.-1

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/24/black-friday-5-reasons-were-heading-for-record-holiday-shopping-season.htmlBlack Friday - 5 reasons we're heading for a record holiday shopping seasonAlthough leading retail forecasters can’t settle on an exact dollar amount, the consensus is already set: we’re going for a record holiday shopping season.

The National Retail Federation projects a growth rate between 3.4 to 4 percent in holiday purchasing over last year, hitting just over $967 per shopper for the first time. Deloitte estimates an even higher level, at nearly $1,226 per shopper.

Regardless of how high the number ends up, experts are following five conditions very closely that align to potentially drive 2017 holiday shopping sales to new record levels.

1) The economy is booming.

Since the drop in 2008 with the Great Recession, holiday spending has returned steadily every year, averaging 3.9 percent annual growth since 2010.

That looks to continue this year in a robust economy. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent in October, which also harkens to levels not seen in more than a decade.

It’s no wonder Deloitte also reported that 81 percent of its recent survey respondents noted their financial situation was the same or better than last year.

2) 32 days of Christmas.

It doesn’t hurt to have a little help from the calendar this year as well. With Thanksgiving falling on Nov. 23, shoppers have one more day and an extra full weekend to mark every item off their list and then some.

Retailers are always looking for ways get the attention of shoppers by tying in with events on the calendar. Once again this year they’ll be featuring last-minute deals that cater to procrastinators, especially during that last full shopping weekend before Christmas, an extra this year that should benefit everyone.

3) Online shopping rises.

For the first time, online shopping for the holiday season is projected to outpace in-store shopping. Last year, Deloitte’s survey highlighted an equal share of shopping between the two options, but this year respondents expect to spend 51 percent of their budget online compared to 42 percent in-store.

We’ve seen it coming for the past several years, but the truth of the matter is that it’s now here.

For many, the in-store experience can still be an enjoyable one. A significant number of consumers still like the idea of using all five of their senses when shopping. Nothing provides a better opportunity than being in stores during the holidays (Black Friday stampedes notwithstanding).

But the crowds of the holiday season are a reality and online shopping provides a convenient alternative. For years, retailers have tried to maximize the online experience for shoppers. Today it appears we have hit that tipping point.

4) Retail therapy.

Let’s face it, 2017 has been a pretty brutal year. The recent months have brought devastating hurricanes, shootings, terrorism and an incredibly divisive political climate.

People everywhere are feeling the hurt and looking for comfort to close out an emotionally draining year. Finding it by sharing love with family and friends, in part through holiday gift- giving, can be just the right therapy for a year like this.

While those feelings of comfort and joy may last only a few weeks, they can still bring a sense of peace and calm into an incredibly tumultuous society.

5) People buying for themselves.

Finally, as selfless as many are in their holiday shopping, it’s hard not to pick up a little something for yourself along the way.

Forty-four percent of respondents in the Deloitte research noted that they wait for holiday sales to make certain purchases for themselves, and 50 percent specifically shop for themselves while looking for others.

The holiday season gives us an excuse to pamper and treat ourselves. At a time when we are interested in looking out for others, it’s quite natural for many to look inward and treat themselves as well.0

Letters told cabin staff: "This performance is not acceptable and it is clear that you are simply not doing your job on board."

The Irish firm is battling to salvage its reputation following a pilot rostering error which led to the company cancelling thousands of flights in September.



LONDON — Ryanair threatened cabin staff with "disciplinary proceedings" and said it would forcibly change their working hours unless they sold more scratchcards and perfume on flights, according to a Guardian report.

The budget airline previously denied that staff were forced to meet onboard sales targets at the risk of punishment after the Mirror reported in September that crew were told they "must sell every day: one perfume, one meal deal, and one item of fresh food and eight scratchcards."

But letters sent to cabin crew indicate that staff were often criticised and threatened with punishment when they failed to meet stringent sales targets.

The letters were sent by two recruitment firms used by Ryanair to staff its planes, one called Workforce and one which could not be named for legal reasons, with both using almost identical wording as each other.

They told staff: "This performance is not acceptable and it is clear that you are simply not doing your job on board."

The letters said staff had "drastically underperformed," and warned that their performance was being "closely monitored."

The letters highlight products including drinks, food, scratchcards, and cosmetics like perfumes, and listed the percentage of flights on which cabin crew members had sold below their targets.

Staff who received the letters were also criticised for failing too often to sell more than €50 (£45) worth of goods. The letter said that "further action will be taken and you may be subject to disciplinary proceedings."

Ryanair told the Guardian: "While we cannot comment in detail on the WorkForce letter, it clearly does not set any 'targets' which must be met.

"As the letter makes clear, any individual, who consistently, and markedly, underperforms, may face disciplinary proceedings 'if there is no significant and sustained improvement.'"

The Irish firm is battling to salvage its reputation following a pilot rostering error which led to the company cancelling thousands of flights in September, a move which is likely to affect over 700,000 bookings overall.-1

The growth in the travel industry coupled with the expanding food service sector have also influenced the market growth. Some of the other factors include increasing population, rising disposable income, rapid urbanisation and premiumisation. According to the report, the market is further expected to reach a volume of around 23 Billion Litres by 2022.

The report has segmented the GCC bottled water market on the basis of type covering still water, carbonated water, flavoured water and mineral water. Currently, still water represents the largest type, accounting for the majority of the shares in the region. The report has further segmented the market on the basis of distribution channels including supermarkets/hypermarkets, retailers, stores, on-trade and others. On the basis of country, Saudi Arabia represents the largest market for bottled water in the region. The report has further analysed the competitive landscape of the market.

http://www.businessinsider.com/putins-party-using-violence-to-cling-to-power-after-losing-election-2017-11Putin's party using physical violence to cling to power after losing an election in MoscowRussian President Vladimir Putin lost an election in western Moscow, but has reverted to using physical violence to maintain power.

A councilor from the opposition party tried to sit at a meeting, but had his microphone cut and was body checked.

Putin faces a larger question of if he will run for president again, as Russia's constitution bars him from doing so.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - More than 10 weeks after losing a local council election in western Moscow, Vladimir Putin's party is clinging to power there - by fair means or foul.

The standoff over control of Filyovsky Park Council came to a head when opposition councilor Vadim Korovin tried to sit in the chairman's seat at a meeting on Tuesday. A councilor from the Russian president's United Russia cut his microphone cable and then body-checked him as he tried to reach the seat.

"This is a violent occupation and seizure of power!" Korovin protested to the United Russia representative, Dmitry Prokhorov, who pushed him from his way as a policeman stepped in to prevent a fight.

All four United Russia members on the council then walked out. Soon afterwards the electricity in the building, and all the lights, went off.

Using flashlights of mobile phones to see, the six opposition members of the 10-seat council continued the meeting. They elected Korovin as deputy chairman and, in effect, caretaker leader, but the United Russia members later refused to recognize the vote.

The battle to control the council, witnessed by a Reuters correspondent who attended Tuesday's meeting, shows how difficult some of Putin's allies find it to surrender power when confronted with the unfamiliar experience of an election defeat.

Moscow is not typical of Russia, as support for Putin and his allies across the country is high. Opinion polls suggest he will easily win next year's presidential election if, as is widely expected, he runs.

But Putin, 65, is barred under the constitution from ruling for more than two consecutive terms so the question of who will succeed him, and how his allies will act when he leaves the political stage, will loom large in coming years.

United Russia representatives have refused to cede power in 10 districts of Moscow where they suffered defeats in local elections on Sept. 10, according to the organizers of the opposition campaign in the Russian capital.

Dmitry Gudkov, a former lawmaker who runs what is known as the United Democrats project, said the Moscow administration, which controls the building where Tuesday's meeting was held, was in a position to play spoiling tactics.

"If they want to disrupt our work they will do it," he said.

Alexander Semennikov, a United Russia deputy in the Moscow city parliament who heads a commission that deals with relations with local councils, said any decisions made by the six Kremlin opponents on the council would have "close to zero" legitimacy.

He described Tuesday's events as part of a "stormy stage in the evolution of municipal institutions in Moscow," and urged the two sides to reach an agreement to resolve the situation.

A spokesman at the Moscow mayor's office referred questions to the city administration's Western region, which includes Filyovsky Park. A spokesman for the Western region declined to comment.

Contradictory laws

United Russia defeated the opposition in a majority of the 125 Moscow districts where voting took place on Sept. 10 but Kremlin opponents increased their share of the vote.

Since the election, opposition councillors in some districts have been stymied by contradictory provisions in the legislation that governs how the councils are organized.

The law states that a council's chair stays in the post until replaced after an election and must be elected by a two-thirds majority. It does not explain what happens if control of the council changes hands but, as in Filyovsky Park district, no party has a two-thirds majority.

In Filyovsky Park, a district with 90,000 inhabitants, Tigran Mkrtchyan, a United Russia member who was appointed interim chairman in August, was among officials who lost their seat on Sept. 10.

But because no side has the two-thirds majority required to elect a new chair, Mkrtchyan, who runs a shopping mall, has continued carrying out his duties.

Official documents issued by the council since the election bear his signature, and the Moscow prosecutor's office supported Mkrtchyan's stance in October.

A document seen by Reuters said former heads of municipal districts can keep running a council until a replacement is elected, even if they have lost their own place on the council. It cited a 2003 law in support of its argument.

Tuesday's meeting, the council's second since the election, had been intended by the opposition council member to break the impasse. But after leaving the meeting, Mkrtchyan told Reuters he would keep the position of temporary head of the council until a new leader is elected.

He and his associates still appeared to be in charge on Friday. When Reuters placed a call to the council, a member of Mkrtchyan's team picked up the phone.-1

Ryanair threatened cabin staff with "disciplinary proceedings" unless they sold more scratchcards and perfume on flights, the Guardian reports.

Letters told cabin staff: "This performance is not acceptable and it is clear that you are simply not doing your job on board."

The Irish firm is battling to salvage its reputation following a pilot rostering error which led to the company cancelling thousands of flights in September.



LONDON — Ryanair threatened cabin staff with "disciplinary proceedings" and said it would forcibly change their working hours unless they sold more scratchcards and perfume on flights, according to a Guardian report.

The budget airline previously denied that staff were forced to meet onboard sales targets at the risk of punishment after the Mirror reported in September that crew were told they "must sell every day: one perfume, one meal deal, and one item of fresh food and eight scratchcards."

But letters sent to cabin crew indicate that staff were often criticised and threatened with punishment when they failed to meet stringent sales targets.

The letters were sent by two recruitment firms used by Ryanair to staff its planes, one called Workforce and one which could not be named for legal reasons, with both using almost identical wording as each other.

They told staff: "This performance is not acceptable and it is clear that you are simply not doing your job on board."

The letters said staff had "drastically underperformed," and warned that their performance was being "closely monitored."

The letters highlight products including drinks, food, scratchcards, and cosmetics like perfumes, and listed the percentage of flights on which cabin crew members had sold below their targets.

Staff who received the letters were also criticised for failing too often to sell more than €50 (£45) worth of goods. The letter said that "further action will be taken and you may be subject to disciplinary proceedings."

Ryanair told the Guardian: "While we cannot comment in detail on the WorkForce letter, it clearly does not set any 'targets' which must be met.

"As the letter makes clear, any individual, who consistently, and markedly, underperforms, may face disciplinary proceedings 'if there is no significant and sustained improvement.'"

The Irish firm is battling to salvage its reputation following a pilot rostering error which led to the company cancelling thousands of flights in September, a move which is likely to affect over 700,000 bookings overall.-1
https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-most-surprising-things-about-australia-according-to-an-italian-expat-2016-2The most surprising things about Australia, according to an Italian expatGiovanni at the Great Ocean Road. Image: Supplied

Giovanni moved from Pesaro (a relaxed town between the hills and the beach in the middle of Italy) to Sydney in 2010 to take a Master in Business Administration at Macquarie Graduate School of Management.

He then worked for four years in management consulting, travelling in a number of cities including remote areas of Queensland, and he is now working on few projects in the M&A industry.

Here’s what has surprised him most about Australia in his time here.



People walking around barefoot

I was surprised to see people walking around barefoot not just at the beach but everywhere else – on the main street shopping, and at the supermarket buying groceries. Even more surprising was to see girls, all dressed up, walking barefoot after the night out with the shoes in their hands.

Not being a girl, I can’t talk from experience, but it leads me to assume heels here are more painful than in the rest of the world.

People whisper in meetings

At first I blamed it on my hearing playing games, but then I realized that people here tend to “whisper” their comments during work meetings.

It is a well known that Italians are loud and do not shy away to make everyone aware they are in the room. After having to repeatedly ask “Can you say it again”, I finally came to accept that it wasn’t the fault of my ears.

I am not sure if it is just matter of local manners, or a matter of different volume standards. Regardless, my meeting minutes tend to end up with a lot of blank spaces.

There is no confrontational feedback

I think Australians have developed a finely tuned way of giving non-confrontational feedback.

I am a simple person and at work back at home I got used to saying it as it is: “I think this is good, I think this is bad, I would do this, I would not do that.”

Since I started working in Sydney, I’ve discovered that rarely people at work openly disagree on something. It’s a less confrontational environment, a subtle game of hints and allusive words, avoiding being too direct and risking upsetting someone.

It remembers me of a shark (Australia!) circling its prey. It’s saying it while not saying it: “Maybe you could also consider this”, “That is a great approach – and by the way, I have seen this other idea working well,” and so on.

So, to help new arrivals: when Australians say this, what they really mean is: “This sucks.”

Cockroaches and spiders everywhere

This may sound a cliché, but it is very surprising for a foreigner: the insects. The sheer quantity of them.

Cockroaches : so many of them, everywhere, all the time. After the first year trying to get rid of every single one of them, I am now inclined towards a more philosophical approach: if you can’t fight them, befriend them.

: so many of them, everywhere, all the time. After the first year trying to get rid of every single one of them, I am now inclined towards a more philosophical approach: if you can’t fight them, befriend them. Spiders: I was pretty impressed to see for the first time a huntsman in all its enormity, but I will never forget the time I was driving my motorbike, when I suddenly noticed a dark shadow moving on the left side of my helmet. It became quickly clear that a spider was walking on my visor, yet not on the outside, but on the INSIDE.

Yes, I had an ginormous huntsman walking on my left eye for about a minute, while driving 100km/h. I found a spot to pull over and threw away my helmet to see the spider jumping out like something out of Ridley Scott’s “Alien”.

So Australian.

The Asian influence is surprisingly strong

When I first landed here I was surprised to see how many Chinese there are in Australia. This was especially the case when I started attending university: it felt like being teleported to China.

The population is so young

The first thing I noticed walking around was how young everybody was, and how many children there are. Try walking around any city in Italy, which has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, and you will understand what I mean; no children around, and grey hair everywhere.

The age difference is also very noticeable at work: I happily find out that here your manager may be in his early 30s while senior leadership meetings are full of young faces.

In Italy, at 40 you are probably still considered a “young guy trying to emerge” and board rooms are full of people that should have already retired 20 years ago.

Good on you Australia.

The pizza is world class

Now you probably expect to read about me complaining that the pizza here is lower quality than in Italy, that the taste is different, it is less this, it is more that, etc. etc.

I will say it: I have had excellent pizzas in Sydney. And I mean excellent pizzas, by an annoyingly picky Italian standard.

And for anyone asking, among other excellent places, my recently discovered favourite one is Caracalla in Haberfield, in Sydney’s inner-west. You have to try it.

Girls at construction sites with “Slow Down” signs

When you drive past road works and there is always a girl holding a ”Slow down” sign. Never a guy. I’ve never seen this before – in fact, I’ve never seen girls in a construction environment.

Then I have been told that drivers tend to pay more attention and effectively slow down if a girl is holding the sign rather than a man. Tricky!

The drinking culture is faster and harder…

Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images

This would probably deserve an article on its own. Australians drink differently than Italians.

I do not want to generalise too much, but in Italy drinking is about enjoying the evening, while here for many (not all) it is about getting smashed. It’s as if you can’t go out and have a good time if you don’t get drunk.

I discovered what I call the “horror of empty”: you can’t have your glass empty for than 10 seconds before the next round is in your hand.

Now I enjoy my drinks, but I am used to drinking more slowly, having breaks between glasses and not feeling guilty to decline the immediate next round.

… but there are so many rules

There are also a surprising amount of alcohol-related “Do’s and don’ts”, in what I’d describe as a policy over reaction: bouncers and security everywhere, you can’t take your glass out of the venue, cocktail pouring is strictly measured, you can’t hang around for a chat outside of a pub or you’ll get ushered away – the list goes on.

Italy is much more relaxed in this sense, free pouring is fine and you can have your drink while walking in the street.

Finally, the fire alarms

Australians love fire alarms.

In 30 years in Europe I never had one single situation where the fire alarm went off, and everyone was evacuated from the office, only to come back half an hour later.

Now I am used to a couple of fire alarm drills a year.

I remember in Brisbane suddenly waking up at my hotel’s fire alarm going off at 4.30am, with a loudspeaker shouting “Emergency, out now! Emergency, out now!” I quickly dressed, ran outside, and found myself in the street as the only person wearing an office suit, surrounded by half-naked people in their pyjamas.

False alarm. “Everyone can go back to bed now”. I was too awake to sleep and already dressed, so I decided to go straight to the office.

Australian graphic design software startup Canva has tripled its revenue to rake in $23.49 million for the 2017 financial year.

The cloud software provider, led by Business Insider Tech 100 entrepreneur Melanie Perkins, brought in $6.8 million in the previous financial year, representing a 245% climb in the space of just 12 months.

The Sydney company, while still in the growth phase, has stemmed its losses as well, going $3.3 million into the red for the year ending June 30, as opposed to $5.26 million the previous June.

Canva and Perkins declined to comment to Business Insider, citing the private nature of its financials.

However, the company did point out it now has a user population of more than 10 million in 179 different countries. On one particular day in late 2016, 50,000 people signed up.

“It’s actually quite crazy, because every week is pretty much our best week ever. We have the most number of designs created, the most number of people joining, it’s quite crazy how quickly we’re growing across every single front,” Perkins told Business Insider at the time.

The graphic design platform, which is a challenger to Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop, was founded in 2012 by Perkins, Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams.

The startup has raised a total of $US42 million in capital, including investments from movie stars Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners, 500 Startup co-founder Dave McClure, Blackbird Ventures and Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen.

In June, the cloud software company reached out into the physical world, launching a print and delivery service to allow customers to turn their designs into paper form. Canva Print first rolled out to the US with 4-day shipping, but is now available in Australia and Europe.

“Whether it’s trying to get your home printer to work, having to drive to the nearest Kinko’s, or making do with a limited online tool, we don’t think that’s the way print should be done,” said Perkins in June.

The platform is currently available in 42 languages, but is set to be expanded to 100 languages by the end of the year. And while the app has long been available on the desktop and iOS, an Android version is coming “soon”.

Perkins this year also starred in a film about Australian startup entrepreneurs, titled The New Hustle, in a project financed by SafetyCulture’s Luke Anear to make the tech world more relatable and accessible.

Canva has more than 200 staff in Sydney, San Francisco and Manila. Staff costs increased from $6.6 million last year to $14.3 million for the 2017 financial year, in the single biggest jump in costs for the company.

We can now get shopping delivered to our front door, do our banking from our phones, book a holiday in a matter of minutes online. Yet when it comes to healthcare, we have been snail like in embracing technology. Just 3.9% of NHS patients use online appointment booking to get an appointment with their GP. For most, the frantic telephone call at 8am to try to get through to the surgery reception remains a reality. And the average wait to see a GP is two weeks and rising.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. We have the technology available to make life far easier for patients and to ease the strain on overstretched GPs. And we can consign the days of waiting weeks to see your doctor to the history books.

A few weeks ago a new NHS service called GP at Hand was launched in London, giving Londoners access to an NHS GP via their mobile phone, 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It has plans to roll out nationally in the future.

A number of NHS GPs in London are making use of technology to deliver this service, which was initially piloted in Essex and West London.

The service cuts down the wait to see a GP from the current average of two weeks to just a matter of hours, yet has met with opposition from several doctors groups, who claim it will break down the traditional relationship between GP and patient and that only young, healthy people would use a digital service.

So what is the role for technology in delivering healthcare? Is it something that should be embraced or is it a threat to our health?

I believe harnessing technology and digital innovation is in fact critical to the future of our NHS. We know we having an ageing population and the NHS is coming under ever increasing demands, with finite resources to deal with that demand. We know our GPs are coming under increasing strain too. GP registrations are up 10% in London alone. And that has knock-on effects, such as people going to A&E when their problem could have been dealt with by a GP, putting further strain on the health service. If, as the government says, we want to deliver a true 7 days a week NHS, we have to start making use of the benefits and efficiencies technology can bring, as almost every other industry has. It’s the only way we’ll be able to continue meeting the ever increasing demand on our NHS whilst continuing to deliver first class care.

We can FaceTime friends and relatives who are half way around the world, it makes sense to be able to have a video consultation with a doctor within minutes rather than waiting weeks for an appointment. And it means problems can be tackled early on and nipped in the bud rather than being allowed to get worse whilst people wait to see a doctor.

And I take issue with the patronising suggestion that older people can’t also benefit from this kind of service. Recent figures from the ONS show the proportion of older people using the internet to keep in touch with family members has doubled over the last six years. These figures also revealed women over 75 showed the greatest increase in internet use of any demographic group. An Ofcom report showed that 48% of 65 to 74-year-olds have a social media profile.

The benefits of being able to see a GP quickly on your phone from the comfort of your home can be felt just as much by older people as they can be by younger, busy workers.

From admin to diagnostics to medical monitoring, technology offers us solutions to put patients in control of their own care and to deliver savings to our health service.

The NHS is rightly a treasured institution in our country and I am proud to have been serving NHS patients for almost 20 years. In the 20th century, the NHS was the first health service in the world to make healthcare universally available and in the 21st century, it is once again leading the way in using technology to make high quality healthcare more accessible to all. We should be glad it is doing so.1
http://time.com/money/4979607/black-friday-sales-deals-consumer-psychology/?xid=homepageThe Psychology Behind Black Friday Crowds — and Why They'll Never Go AwayIt’s no coincidence that horror director George Romero’s 1978 zombie flick, Dawn of the Dead, culminates in a mall, with legions of zombies drawn to the place to gorge mindlessly. If the undead were craving bargains rather than human brains, it could have been just any old Black Friday—a hellscape like none other, in the minds of many shoppers and nonshoppers alike.

Agitated crowds. Brawls. Trampling. The mayhem supposedly happens in the pursuit of bargains, and in 2017 it’s fascinating that this phenomenon—much like a zombie—can’t seem to die.

Why is this?

The term “Black Friday” was first used by retail marketers after World War II. But it wasn’t until the consumerism-crazed 1980s that it truly became a big deal nationally. As Black Friday became hyped as a standout day when stores were flooded with ultracheap prices and amazing discounts, something of an arms race arose. Retailers began opening earlier and earlier on the Friday morning after Thanksgiving, and crowds waiting outside in the frigid predawn grew bigger and bigger in antsy anticipation of the “doorbuster” deals lying inside.

Shoppers stand like zombies outside of a Target store at midnight in Torrington, Connecticut, in 2011. Jessica Rinaldi—Reuters

But for years now, online and physical retailers alike have hosted flash sales and deep markdowns long before and long after. Black “Friday” sales now launch on Thanksgiving Day itself, and the concept of “Christmas creep”—promotions as early as September and October—has significantly expanded the holiday shopping season. Shoppers can often find cheaper prices on days during the holiday shopping season other than Black Friday, including Cyber Monday.

Sales-tracking sites like DealNews.com say that the vast majority of deals on Black Friday itself can be ordered online, negating any reason to hit the store. Retailers seem to be phoning it in on this supposedly special day too: After looking over several seasons’ worth of Black Friday ads, consumer-deals tracking site BradsDeals.com has concluded that stores like Target, Walmart, and Macy’s repeat the lion’s share of Black Friday promotions. Same items, same prices, year after year.

All of this feeds into the theory floated annually by retail analysts that Black Friday is dying, or is perhaps already extinct or at least irrelevant.

Except it’s not.

Yes, foot traffic and spending in brick-and-mortar stores have been decreasing on Black Friday, and in surveys there’s a steady increase of consumers saying they know Black Friday doesn’t necessarily have the lowest prices. Fewer shoppers wake before dawn to hit the stores on Black Friday, and many more shoppers seem content to browse online rather than battle it out with Black Friday crowds in person—assuming they’re shopping at all this day.

But the fact is there are still insane numbers of Black Friday crowds. According to a Mintel survey, 23% of American holiday shoppers say they will go shopping in a physical store on Black Friday 2017. Tech-savvy younger consumers, who are presumably most comfortable with online shopping, are particularly likely to partake in the traditional Black Friday experience; 42% of survey participants ages 18 to 22 said they planned on shopping in brick-and-mortar stores on the day.

Ebony Gills of Elkhart reaches for a piece of pie from Mike Garcia's plate as they wait for Target in Goshen to open on Thursday, Nov. 28, 2013. With three hours still to wait, the group huddled around a propane heater that Joey Lukkarila brought from her home in Wakarusa. "This isn't my first rodeo," she said. Jon Garcia—APEbony Gills of Elkhart, Indiana reaches for a piece of pie as she waits for Target to open on Black Friday 2013. "This isn't my first rodeo," she said.

So what’s happening? Why don’t they just stay home and chill, perhaps do a little no-stress online shopping where the deals are just as compelling? Part of the reason that Black Friday is a phenomenon is simply that, well, Black Friday is a phenomenon and not about low prices.

“They want to experience the excitement of the event firsthand,” says DealNews.com’s director of content marketing Lindsay Sakraida. The site polled people at Target to see if they were there for anything specific. The answer? Not really. “They just wanted to see what all the fuss was about,” she says.

In other words, many people view Black Friday as the shopping equivalent of the Super Bowl: They look forward to it not necessarily for the game itself (which can be underwhelming) but because of the desire to be a part of the action, and to evaluate how this extremely hyped event unfolds—pomp, circumstance, commercials, and all.

Beyond FOMO (fear of missing out), consumer psychologist Kit Yarrow explains that Black Friday is simply an ingrained tradition for families and friends. People typically have the day off work and need something to do with out-of-town visitors. They just spent the previous day mostly indoors, eating too much food and watching too much TV. An outing at the mall is something toddlers, tweens, and grandparents can get behind.

“You might look at the Black Friday crowds and feel bad that they’re that desperate for a bargain,” says Yarrow. “That’s not it at all. They’re excited about this day. It’s a group activity. This is fun with friends.”

Sure, you could shop on Black Friday with your best friend or favorite aunt with a tablet from the comfort of your couch, but it’s just not as thrilling as being in the mall, among the gaggles clamoring for deals. There’s something about touching the merchandise that gets those competitive juices flowing.

“It’s an element of instant gratification and satisfaction that comes with toughing it out for a deal,” adds Sakraida.

Yarrow also says that in today’s retail scene, when shoppers are routinely confronted with 40%-off promotions and it’s more impossible than ever to grasp what a decent price is, consumers glom onto Black Friday as a day when they can lower their guard and just buy some stuff. “We are in an era of distrust, when you never know when a deal is a good deal,” she says. The arrival of Black Friday “tells them they’re at least not going to get ripped off.”

So go ahead and walk with the zombies. Don’t feel guilty. And remember: You’ll never be alone.-1

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/south-african-appeals-court-more-than-doubles-pistorius-sentence.htmlSouth African appeals court more than doubles Pistorius sentenceSouth Africa's Supreme Court increased Oscar Pistorius' murder sentence on Friday to 13 years and five months after the state argued his original sentence of six years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was "shockingly lenient".

Rights groups in a country beset by high levels of violent crime against women say Pistorius, a gold medal-winning athlete known as the "Blade Runner" for his carbon-fibre prosthetics, received preferential treatment compared to non-whites and those without his wealth or international celebrity status.

Pistorius was jailed in July last year after being found guilty on appeal of murdering Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013 in a case that attracted worldwide interest.

He was not in court for Friday's ruling. The court handed down the minimum 15-year sentence prescribed for murder in South Africa, and subtracted the years Pistorius had already served.

Steenkamp's family, who were not in court for the ruling, welcomed the sentence and said it showed justice could prevail in South Africa.

"This is an emotional thing for them. They just feel that their trust in the justice system has been confirmed this morning," Tania Koen, a family spokeswoman, told Reuters.

Judge Willie Seriti, reading out the court's decision, said: "The sentence imposed ... in respect of murder is set aside and substituted with the following: the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 13 years and five months."

The athlete was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in jail. That conviction was increased to murder by the Supreme Court in December 2015 and his sentence was increased to six years by trial judge Thokozile Masipa.

At the time, Masipa ruled that although the Steenkamps had suffered a great loss, Pistorius' life and career were also in ruins, adding that "a fallen hero can never be at peace".

State prosecutors said they would appeal, arguing there had been no mitigating circumstances to give such a sentence.

At a hearing earlier this month at the appeals court, state prosecutors, led by advocate Andrea Johnson, said the athlete had shown no remorse for firing four shots through a locked bathroom door that hit Steenkamp.

Defence lawyer Barry Roux had told the court at the appeals hearing that Pistorius did not deliberately kill model and law graduate Steenkamp and the appeal should be thrown out.

The family of the athlete, who had the lower part of his legs amputated when he was a baby, were not immediately available to comment.-1

When fire engulfed Grenfell Tower nearly six months ago, with the loss of 71 lives, many were astonished that a London tower block could burn so quickly and with such devastating results. But one of the building's residents foresaw it all too clearly - he just couldn't find anyone to listen to his warnings.

Last November, on a grey Sunday with the rain drizzling constantly outside his window, a man sat at his computer on the 16th floor of his West London tower block and began to write a blog.

You know when you just get the pen and just write? - that's what happened that day Edward Daffarn, Grenfell Action Group blog

"It is our conviction that a serious fire in a tower block... is the most likely reason that those who wield power at the KCTMO [Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation] will be found out and brought to justice!"

Six months later, on 14 June, London woke up to the news that a fire had blazed through Grenfell Tower on the Lancaster West estate in North Kensington, killing dozens of residents. By the following night the blog had received more than two million hits.

"You know when you just get the pen and just write?" says the blog's author. "That's what happened that day, and looking back it's like a premonition that's so awful. I would never have written that had I known what was going to happen."

The man behind the blog is Edward Daffarn, a 55-year-old social worker who had lived on the estate for 16 years. He was in his flat two-thirds of the way up Grenfell Tower when the fire took hold. Luckily, a neighbour called him in time and urged him to get out. He wrapped a wet towel around his head and ran into the smoke that had already filled the building. That night he lost his home, all his possessions, and the community he loved.

Daffarn is understandably emotional when reflecting on the last few months, but more than that he is angry. Angry with the way he feels Grenfell residents were treated by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation - the people who were entrusted to maintain the estate and keep its residents safe. Angry with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, which was meant to scrutinise the KCTMO. Angry with a society which didn't seem to care about people like him - people who live on housing estates - until it was too late.

"The reality is if you're on a housing estate it's indifference and neglect, two words that sum up everything about the way we were treated," he says. "They weren't interested in providing housing services, keeping us safe, maintaining the estate. They were just interested in themselves."

It wasn't for us to tell the council what they should be doing we were just trying to raise an alarm Edward Daffarn, Grenfell Action Group blog

Daffarn and fellow Grenfell resident Francis O'Connor had been blogging on behalf of the Grenfell Action Group since 2012. They wrote about issues that concerned their tight-knit community - air pollution, the closure of the local public library, and their fears that corners were being cut during the refurbishment of the tower.

"We wanted to record for history how a community on a housing estate in the fifth richest country in the world could be ignored, neglected, treated with indifference. We never thought we could make change. We just wanted to record what was happening," he says.

Daffarn and O'Connor shared a theory that Kensington and Chelsea - a London borough more widely known for its museums, designer shops and flower shows - actually wanted its council estates to go into decline, so that the residents would leave and expensive flats could be built in this sought-after location. For this they were described as fantasists.

"We weren't fantasists," he says, visibly hurt. "We were trying to raise genuine concerns about how our community was being run down."

The natural consequence, he concluded, would be loss of life. Which is why on 20 November 2016, frustrated and desperate, Edward wrote the blog post KCTMO - Playing with fire!

"It is a truly terrifying thought but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord."

A few months earlier a fire had ripped through five floors of a tower block in Shepherd's Bush, just down the road. Edward was worried that if a fire broke out in his tower block residents wouldn't know what to do. They had been given no proper fire safety instructions from the KCTMO. There were no instructions on individual floors on how residents should act in the event of a fire, there was only a recent newsletter saying residents should remain in their flats - advice which in the case of the Shepherd's Bush fire would have led to fatalities.

There's a lot of abusive behaviour evidenced forensically about what was happening to our community, but it wasn't sexy so it never got picked up Edward Daffarn, Grenfell Action Group blog

In March 2017 the KCTMO installed fire safety instruction notices in the entrance hallway to Grenfell Tower and outside the lifts on every floor of the building, again urging residents to "stay put" unless the fire was "in or affecting your flat".

It wasn't the first time the Grenfell blog's authors had raised concerns about fire safety.

Before the blog began, when a school was built on the only green space the residents had, they wrote to the borough pointing out that access for fire and emergency vehicles had been compromised.

Later they blogged about the blocking of a fire exit with mattresses during the refurbishment and the power surges in 2013 that manifested in flickering lights, computers and stereos blowing up, and entire rooms filling with smoke. These continued for three weeks, Daffarn says.

"We were tenants we weren't fire safety specialists but we were switched on enough to feel this was important and it was not being dealt with on our estate and that's why we were blogging. It wasn't for us to tell the council what they should be doing., We were just trying to raise an alarm."

An alarm that went unanswered. The November 2016 blog post represented the last moment at which something might have been done to avert the disaster which followed six months later. But why didn't anyone heed or investigate Daffarn's claims?

Hidden within the story of the Grenfell blog is another story of the decline of local media. There simply was no local press on the ground in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea scrutinising the authorities and helping to amplify the voice of people like Edward Daffarn.

The last time he had the attention of a local journalist was in 2014 when Camilla Horrox, the reporter for the Kensington and Chelsea Chronicle ran front page stories about Grenfell residents' concerns regarding the possible presence of asbestos on the site of the new school and about the power surges.

The question should be for you - why did you miss it? Edward Daffarn, Grenfell Action Group blog

She had met Daffarn several times, and had been concerned about KCTMO's dealings with the residents of the properties it managed.

But when the newspaper was closed down later that year Horrox was made redundant and all her Grenfell articles disappeared from the web. The Kensington and Chelsea Chronicle was incorporated into a website that reports on 29 west London districts. Horrox's replacement was expected to report on three boroughs - Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham - while based in Surrey, an hour's drive away.

Some residents of the borough might have been under the mistaken impression that they did have a local newspaper. In 2015 a free paper, The Kensington and Chelsea News, was established to fill the gap left by the closing of the Chronicle. But when I tracked down its reporter he explained that he was the sole reporter working on the paper, and on two other local newspapers - his salary was £500 a week and he did almost all his reporting from home in Dorset, 150 miles away. He made it to the borough only twice in two-and-a-half years, and the one story he ever published about Grenfell was from a council press release about the installation of the new cladding.

Local News: What Are We Missing? was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Listen again on iPlayer.

Though he always searched for a "good front page splash" for each of the three editions, he also made sure to find two pages of royal stories and two pages of entertainment stories.

Edward Daffarn didn't take his concerns to the media in November 2016 because he no longer thought anyone would listen. But the blog was out there for everyone to see, he points out, if only they had been looking.

"We'd been blogging for three or four years and you go back over that time there's a lot of abusive behaviour evidenced forensically about what was happening to our community, but it wasn't sexy so it never got picked up."

For Edward, what was going on at Grenfell wasn't just a local story, but a national one. A story about invisible people in a society that cared more about celebrity and wealth than its most vulnerable residents.

Close to tears, he admonishes the nation's journalists.

"If you look back now our whole community of North Kensington, the policy that the local authority was taking every public space and privatising it, that that could be missed by the BBC, by Channel Four, by these wider news agencies... The question should be for you, why did you miss it?

"Why aren't our lives important enough for you?"

'Our residents deserve answers'

Responding to Edward Daffarn's allegations, a spokesman for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council said:

"The Tenant Management Organisation was responsible for managing and maintaining Grenfell Tower. Our residents deserve answers about what went wrong and the public inquiry will help provide these.

"We're changing our Council and the way we work with our communities, ensuring residents are at the heart of everything we do. We will provide all households from Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk with the best offer of new housing possible - and we are listening to what they want and moving at their pace."

A spokesman for the Tenant Management Organisation declined to respond to specific allegations because of the public inquiry and police investigation into the tragic events at Grenfell Tower.

He added: "As a resident-led organisation we want to fully understand what happened at Grenfell Tower. We recognise our responsibility to ensure that the public inquiry and police investigation processes are not hampered or undermined in any way; to that end we are co-operating fully with them and are determined to continue to help with these processes."

Methodology

All data used on this page is compiled and made available by the ONS's Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) - the most recent release was 26 October, 2017. The survey doesn't include self-employed workers or bonuses. We have chosen to use data for full-time workers only.

The BBC has examined figures from 2011 to 2017, inclusive. We excluded jobs entirely if there was no figure for 2017. Other sections may be hidden for certain jobs due to missing data.

The only sheets we used are those referring to "Gross annual pay" and "Hourly pay- excluding overtime". We used hourly pay to work out the gender pay gap and annual pay for all other figures. We selected the median figure rather than the mean, as per ONS advice.

We used the CPI measure of inflation to make real-term adjustments, comparing the indices for April 2017 with April 2011 and April 2016. The survey is completed in April at the end of each financial year.0
http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171122-the-surprising-story-behind-the-designs-seen-every-dayThe surprising story behind the designs we see every dayThe phrase ‘hand-looming’ has a quaint, cottage-industry ring to it. So it’s a surprise to hear that the creators of most of the seating textiles on London’s vast public transport network rely heavily on such an old-fashioned method.

If you have ever travelled on London’s tubes, trains or buses, you have sat on something created by British duo Wallace Sewell, whose unique, rich colour palettes and eye for geometry and pattern have brought global recognition. Despite their traditional craft methods, their output is anything but small-scale.

Emma Sewell is one half of the design duo, whose work is currently the subject of an exhibition at London’s Fashion and Textile Museum. She explains the process to BBC Designed: “We start in a very analogue fashion, sampling ideas as small swatches on our handlooms, exploring colour, woven structure and patterning or winding yarn around strips of card to create stripes.

“We then develop these ideas into designs for full scarves or throws, deciding on the composition and proportions of all the elements. Once these are set, we then create the specs, which are just words and numbers, and email these to the mill, who follow these instructions to weave the specific cloth, without seeing any of the designs or samples. It’s quite amazing.”

It has to perform in the public domain, identifiable yet in the background, so semi-invisible – Emma Sewell

Sewell met her business partner Harriet Wallace-Jones at art college, and they set up their brand shortly afterwards. Now, 25 years on, they create the many moquettes (thick-pile fabric used for carpets or upholstery) for Transport for London, as well as for the overground network, Croydon tram service and the new Crossrail trains.

Travel in style

Transport is a great area to work in, says Sewell: “It has such a design heritage, with an amazing array of textiles designers who have created patterns in the past. It is also a real contrast to the style of designing for our own brand, which is quite flamboyant with many colours, contrasting yarns and textures and large scale repeats; whereas ‘moquette’ fabrics have tight parameters.”

The requirements are uniquely specific. “There’s a need for a complex pattern in order to camouflage wear and tear, plus it has to reinforce the branding of the transport company, in our case TFL,” explains Sewell. “And it has to perform in the public domain, identifiable yet in the background, so semi-invisible.”

If you look closely enough, the shapes of London landmarks can be spotted in the geometry of some of the designs. “The nature of our style of weaving, which is ‘dobby’ weaving, doesn’t allow us to create complex shapes, we are restricted to stripes and blocks of colour, plus small-scale patterns. This means that we have to abstract our inspiration sources, which could be anything from a landscape or figurative painting, to a sculpture,” says Sewell.

Over the years, the duo has created rugs, throws and cushions for the likes of retailers Anthropologie and West Elm, and the Tate and MoMA museum shops, as well as for their own London store. They even recreated Jimi Hendrix’s bed spread for his London house, now turned museum. The designers have also created some richly-hued scarf designs, such as the Verbana wool-crepe scarf which has a sculpted surface and is made from ‘high-twist’ crepe, so that the fabric springs back by itself into its crinkly shape after washing.

The two business partners have a shared passion for colour and a love of Bauhaus design. “We use many references as colour inspiration for our work,” says Sewell. “From paintings and art to our surroundings, both urban and rural, to an ongoing exploration of colour palettes, where one might include an unusual colour just for the fun of it.”

We believe that two heads are better than one – Emma Sewell

Having worked together since the late 1980s, the duo is able to “work through ideas very quickly” and “discuss details in shorthand.” They then divide up the design work between them, each playing to their own strengths.

So what would Sewell say have been the main pros and cons of working in a partnership? “Our styles of designing were very different,” says Sewell. “Harriet’s interest was compositional ideas aimed at interiors, whilst mine was the structure of woven cloth and performance yarns, creating fabrics with sculpted surfaces, aimed at fashion. This meant that we had a broader portfolio of work, though this was always linked by our equal passion for colour.” In fact, the pair say they can’t even think of any disadvantages to working as a pair.

“In the early days, the companionship and moral support were invaluable, yet we have always had equal creative and business goals,” says Wallace. Plus being in a partnership allows “a wider creative input.” And the geographical distance between the two women – Sewell lives in London, Wallace-Jones in Dorset – also encourages their individual creativity. “We’re not precious, we can always come to a compromise without falling out. From the outset we believe that two heads are better than one.”

http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-stocks-tanked-yesterday-and-this-liquor-store-shows-why-2017-11Chinese stocks tanked yesterday — and this liquor store shows whyChinese stocks bombed yesterday after months of low volatility.

Reports suggest the selloff was a byproduct of efforts by Chinese authorities to curb investment into Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd.

Kweichow is the biggest liquor company in China and the maker of Baiju.



Yesterday’s sharp decline in Chinese stocks interrupted months of low volatility, as the benchmark Shanghai Composite index suffered its worst one-day fall since June 2016.

Reports suggest the selloff also stems from efforts by Chinese authorities to cool investment in one of China’s hottest companies.

The company in question: Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd, the biggest liquor company in China and the maker of Baiju, a popular beverage derived from grain.

Last Friday, shares in Kweichow closed 4% lower after state-run news agency Xinhau published an article discouraging speculative investment in the stock, according to the South China Morning Post.

The company’s shares have subsequently fallen every day this week and it's now lost 11.8% since closing at an all-time high on November 16:

So why did authorities target Kweichow in particular?

For starters, it’s huge — which makes it a target for regulatory supervision given the potential impact on the broader market from moves in the stock price.

According to Bloomberg, Kweichow has the second highest weighting in the SSE50 index — comprised of the 50 biggest stocks traded on mainland China — behind Ping An Insurance.

Shares in the company have also surged this year, thus increasing concerns about speculative investing activity.

Despite the 11.8% slide over the past week, Kweichow has more than doubled in value in 2017:

The company operates with huge profit margins compared to industry peers, and currently has a price to earnings (PE) ratio of more than 30 times.

Earlier this year, it surpassed Diageo as the most valuable liquor company in the world, Bloomberg said.

Combined with the recent rise in Chinese bond yields as authorities clamp down on excessive leverage, the latest effort by Chinese regulators to cool speculation in Chinese stocks appeared to rattle markets yesterday.

The losses in mainland China extended to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which fell by 1%.

After yesterday’s jitters, Chinese markets will be in focus today during Asian trade when the Shanghai Composite index opens at 12:30 pm AEST.-1

Mars has suspended global advertising with Google after two investigations by the BBC and The Times found sexualised comments under videos of children.

Volunteer moderators who flag inappropriate comments or suspected predator accounts told the publications they get little help from YouTube.

The volunteers said they have no child protection training, and hand over data to the police.

YouTube has taken measures to crack down on inappropriate content but acknowledged it has more to do.

YouTube is still failing to clean up inappropriate, sexualised comments left under videos featuring children, according to investigations by the BBC and The Times.

Ad

And Mars has suspended its global advertising with Google after The Times found its ads running against videos featuring children, with predatory comments beneath.

YouTube reportedly relies on a handful of volunteers to clean up comments made by sexual predators - with one commenter encouraging a young YouTuber who posted a prank video of himself taking a cold shower to "try not to wear black boxers."

Other predators apparently leave requests related to sexual fetishes under videos featuring children, though the videos themselves may be perfectly innocent in their subject matter.

The allegations were made by people who work for free to flag up inappropriate YouTube content, known as "trusted flaggers." These people are not employed directly by YouTube, but have access to more tools to flag up comments or videos to YouTube's teams.

According to flaggers speaking to the BBC and The Times, YouTube has given little support, instead leaving the volunteers to comb through thousands of inappropriate comments and hand them over to US police. The Times report claimed the flaggers had flagged 12,000 accounts belonging to suspected predators, but an estimated 50,000 remain on the service.

One flagged is quoted as saying: "It should not be our responsibility alone to investigate and liaise with law enforcement.

"YouTube's teams should be the ones actively passing this through their established channels with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other law enforcement agencies to reduce this kind of illegal activity."

According to the BBC, the online form where users can flag up inappropriate content appears to have a flaw too. The form apparently is missing associated links, meaning a YouTube staffer can see a report has been made, but has no idea which comment has been flagged up.

The timing could hardly be worse for YouTube, which held its annual Brandcast event for advertisers on Thursday evening in London.

Mars suspended its global advertising with Google after the Times investigation, which found ads appearing against videos showing half-dressed young girls. While the videos were innocent, they reportedly had several predatory comments beneath. The Times also found ads for Amazon, eBay, and Deutsche Bank appearing against similar videos. The brands said they would investigate immediately.

The reports come just a day after YouTube claimed it was cleaning up its act around inappropriate content relating to children. The site said it would suspend comments left under videos featuring children if there were any signs of inappropriate commenting. It's also clamping down on videos that appear to show the mistreatment of children.

YouTube sent the following statement to Business Insider:

"Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. We have clear policies against videos and comments on YouTube which sexualise or exploit children and we enforce them aggressively whenever alerted to such content. We have recently toughened our approach to videos and comments featuring children which may not be illegal, but give cause for concern. In just the past week we've disabled comments on thousands of videos that we've identified as of potential interest to predators and shut down hundreds of accounts identified as making predatory comments. We are committed to getting this right and recognise we need to do more, both through machine learning and by increasing human and technical resources."-2

ATM operator Stargroup, which had plans to convert its some of its machines to digital currency Bitcoin, is trading as normal despite going into administration.

This week Richard Tucker and John Bumbak of insolvency experts KordaMentha Restructuring were appointed as receivers and managers.

The company’s latest annual report showed debt of $9.1 million.

Today Goldfields Money Limited, which provides the cash for Stargroup’s network of automatic teller machines, said it’s owed $526,000 in fees.

The company says it has about $6.5 million in the network.

“Cash deployed by Goldfields Money under the terms of the existing bailment funding agreement with Stargroup is and remains the property of Goldfields Money,” the company says.

The receivers and managers are seeking expressions of interest to sell or recapitalise the business.

“The Receivers and Managers advise that they intend to trade the business on a business as usual strategy,” they said.

In Australia, Stargroup has 500 of its own ATMs and manages another 2,400.

CEO Todd Zani told news service Stockhead the major banks removing ATM fees was not the cause of the debt issue.

The company in September announced a joint venture with DigitalX, a blockchain technology and advisory company, to convert ATMs to trade the digital currency Bitcoin.

Currently there are fewer than 20 ATMs in Australia which can process a Bitcoin transaction with conversion fees between 4% and 8% of the transaction value.

In 2017, Stargroup posted a 128.4% rise in full year revenue to $8.36 million. Profit more than tripled to $1.94 million.

https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/11/yep-its-still-not-a-good-idea-to-eat-raw-cookie-doughYep, It's Still Not A Good Idea To Eat Raw Cookie DoughFor some, sneaking a mouthful of raw cookie dough while baking is an indelible -- and certainly delicious - part of the process. But while we've been told to avoid dough containing raw eggs, a new investigation confirms that tainted raw flour was responsible for an E. coli outbreak in 2016 - a finding that will surely test our temptation to lick the bottom of the bowl.

As you may remember from last year, General Mills had to recall three of its flour products - Gold Medal Flour, Gold Medal Wondra Flour, and Signature Kitchens Flour - following an outbreak of Escherichia coli. That amounted to over 10 million pounds of flour. At the time, E. coli was fingered as a likely suspect, triggering an investigation. That investigation is now officially over, and the resulting study published in The New England Journal of Medicine confirms it. The dry, powdery substance that is flour can host foodborne pathogens, as unlikely as that sounds.

From December 2015 to September 2016, there were 56 cases of E. coli-related illnesses reported across 24 US states. No one died, but one patient came down with a severe form of kidney failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome) brought on by an E. coli infection. Earlier in the year, experts with the US Centres for Disease Control identified the mysterious strain as belonging to serogroup O121, sparking an investigation that eventually linked the illness to the consumption of raw flour.

During the investigation, scientists interviewed the people who got sick, making sure they weren't using ingredients that were past the "sell by" or "use by" dates. The patients said they remembered eating raw batter or dough while baking a few days before they came down with symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever. Importantly, 85 per cent of the patients baked with the same brand of flour, allowing the researchers to trace the outbreak to a single flour processing facility.

The authors of the new report warn that dangerous microorganisms on wheat or other ingredients in flour "can survive the drying process and remain viable in flour for months" in a dehydrated state. This is worrisome news because raw flour is traditionally not thought of as a vector for foodborne diseases.

It's unlikely that your favourite brand of flour has E. coli lingering within, but as this new study shows, you may not want to take any chances. Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration put out an advisory warning people to avoid eating raw dough, while offering these tips:

Do not eat any raw cookie dough, cake mix, batter, or any other raw dough or batter product that is supposed to be cooked or baked.

Follow package directions for cooking products containing flour at proper temperatures and for specified times.

Wash hands, work surfaces, and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour and raw dough products.

Keep raw foods separate from other foods while preparing them to prevent any contamination that may be present from spreading. Be aware that flour may spread easily due to its powdery nature.

Follow label directions to chill products containing raw dough promptly after purchase until baked.

Each year in the United States, around 265,000 cases of E. coli-related illnesses are reported, and as this new study shows, some of these could be avoided by not eating raw dough.

Mmmmm, delicious, tainted raw dough....

What are the main benchmarks doing?

S&P 500 futures ESZ7, +0.18% rose 3.9 points, or 0.1%, to 2,598.50, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YMZ7, +0.12% added 21 points, or less than 0.1%, to 23,506. Nasdaq-100 futures NQZ7, +0.10% gained 5.75 points, or less than 0.1%, to 6,395.25.

The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq will close at 1 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday, while the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommends a 2 p.m. Eastern close for bond markets. U.S. financial markets were closed Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving Day.

In a week shortened by the holiday, the DJIA and S&P 500 are each looking at gains of 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite is set to gain 1.2%, with just a shortened session of trading to go.

On Wednesday, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% and Dow DJIA, -0.27% posted moderate falls, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.07% inched up slightly. That softer tone came as minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting indicated an interest-rate hike is possible, but the pace of future tightening could be more moderate.

Stock futures had a quiet day of trade on Thanksgiving Day.

What could help drive markets?

Roughly half of normal trading volumes are expected on Friday, and investors are likely to zero in on how retailers are faring for Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday shopping.

Adobe Analytics data showed online shoppers spent $1.52 billion on Thanksgiving Day, with smartphones accounting for 46% of all traffic going to U.S. retail websites.

Opinion: Investors can feel safe ignoring the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping reports

On the data front, a preliminary reading of the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for November is expected from Markit at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time, along with the services PMI.

Which stocks are in focus?

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.46% , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.11% , Target Corp. TGT, +0.42% and Macy’s Inc. M, +1.03% are among the retailers expected to compete for shoppers’ attention with a wide range of deals.

Wal-Mart and Target shares were unchanged in premarket trading, while Amazon was up 0.7%.

What are analysts saying?

“The pre-sales data indicate a better performance compared with last year; early numbers point at a solid 18% year-over-year increase in November sales so far. U.S. households’ holiday spending could increase as much as 4% compared with last year, according to Bloomberg news,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at LCG.com.

Analysts are continuing to release their stock-market forecasts for the coming year. Strategists at Société Générale said in their outlook released Thursday that bullish investors may have a tough time in 2018.

“We expect stretched valuations and rising bond yields to limit equity index performances in 2018 and the prospect of a U.S. economic slowdown in 2020 to further cramp returns in 2019,” said a team led by Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy.

But the euro remained in focus as it continued to extend gains for the week.

Trading volumes will likely be thin on Friday as U.S. markets will be on a shortened schedule following Thursday’s Thanksgiving Day holiday.

How key gauges moved: In Paris, the CAC 40 PX1, +0.61% claimed a 0.3% rise at 5,395.34 following Thursday’s close at a near two-week high. In Madrid, the IBEX 35 IBEX, +0.91% picked up 0.6% to reach 10,098.10.

The export-heavy German DAX 30 benchmark DAX, +0.29% was up 0.1% at 13,025.59, on track for a modest weekly rise of 0.2%.

But the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index UKX, -0.12% was down 0.3% at 7,396.60. That kept pressure on the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.21% , which was down 0.1% at 386.91. Health care and telecom stocks led the declining sectors on the pan-European index. But tech and financial shares were higher. On Thursday, the benchmark closed up less than 1 point after a topsy-turvy session.

For the week, the Stoxx 600 was on course to rise 0.9%. That would be the first weekly rise in three.

The euro EURUSD, +0.1266% bought $1.1872, up from $1.1850 late Thursday in New York. The shared currency has added roughly 0.7% this week.

What’s driving markets: Businesses in Germany have been upbeat about their prospects this month and for the months ahead. German think tank Ifo said Friday its business climate index rose to a record high of 117.5 points, surpassing expectations.

“Germany is on track for an economic boom,” said Ifo president Clemens Fuest in the report.

But the bulk of the Ifo survey’s responses came before the collapse of talks to create a coalition to form a German government on Sunday.

Still, the euro extended gains following the Ifo report, having risen Thursday after an upbeat reading on eurozone services and manufacturing activity and a finding of higher growth in German gross domestic product.

A stronger euro can be a headwind to shares of European exporters as it makes products made by those companies more expensive for holders of other currencies to purchase.

The political crisis in Germany was still in focus, after the Social Democrats reportedly dropped their hard refusal to set up another Grand Coalition to govern alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.

What strategists are saying: The [euro-dollar pair] is one of the talking points for us as technically it approaches some key levels in its recent set ups with 1.1880 now acting as the key resistance on the upside,” said James Hughes, chief market analyst at Axi Trader, in a note. “It’s been a strange week for the euro with traders not entirely sure what to make of the news of a breakdown in talks, and the possibility of another election.”

“European markets are trading cautiously this morning, despite a broadly positive Asia session, and more decent economic reports from Germany, with most of the focus at the end of a fairly choppy week on retailers as the Black Friday sales get under way in earnest,” said CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson, in a note.

“After two successive weeks of losses we do appear to be seeing some stabilization but the overall mood appears to be one of caution,” Hewson said.

Stock movers: BT Group PLC BT.A, -0.88% fell 1.2%, with Deutsche Bank cutting its price target on the British telecoms group to £2.38 from £2.68, according to Dow Jones Newswires.

Italian banks were among the best performers on the Stoxx 600, with BPER Banca SpA BPE, +5.96% up 5.7%, Banco BPM SpA BAMI, +6.30% higher by 5.4% and Unione di Banche Italiane SpA UBI, +4.45% up 4.5%.0

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kirkland-apos-kirk-q3-loss-130701844.htmlKirkland's (KIRK) Q3 Loss Widens Y/Y, Earnings View TrimmedKirkland's, Inc. KIRK posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the company reported a wider-than-anticipated loss that also compared unfavorably with the year-ago period. Moreover, management narrowed its earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. Nonetheless, sales remained strong, backed by the company’s e-commerce and merchandise enhancement initiatives, also making management optimistic about the holiday season performance.



Shares of the company gained 2.1% on Nov 21. However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company, which has been reporting a loss for three straight quarters now, has slumped 15.6% year to date as against the industry’s growth of 4.3%.









Quarter in Detail



This Brentwood, TN-based company reported adjusted loss of 10 cents per share which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents. Also, the reported figure was wider than the adjusted loss of 5 cents in the prior-year quarter. Including the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Kirkland’s loss came in at 15 cents per share.

Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise



Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. Quote

Kirkland's recorded net sales of about $145 million that increased 4.9% year over year, courtesy of strong contributions from new stores, robust e-commerce growth and effective marketing initiatives. Sales also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $143 million.



Including e-commerce sales, comparable store sales (comps) inched up 0.7%, as against a 2.3% drop witnessed in the prior-year quarter. However, comps were also hurt by the impact of hurricanes, excluding which, it jumped 2%. Comps in the third quarter were backed by improvements in conversion and average ticket.



We also note that Kirkland’s merchandise enhancements have been yielding positive results, despite persistent decline in traffic amid a tough retail environment. In fact, the company had a positive conversion rate for the fifth consecutive quarter, which along with higher average ticket helped to offset the mid-single digit drop in store traffic.



Further, e-commerce sales remained robust, surging 40% year over year on the back of the company’s constant focus on enhancing omni-channel business, online product range and fulfilment operations. E-commerce revenues contributed $15.3 million to total sales in the quarter, thus representing 11% of the top line. This was backed by robust improvements in website traffic and average order value. Further, sales from third-party drop-ship strategy boosted e-commerce revenues.



The home decor retailer’s gross profit remained nearly flat year over year at $50.5 million. However, gross margin declined 160 basis points to 34.9%. While merchandise margins improved 25 bps, it was countered by unfavorable mix of third-party drop-ship revenues. Also, we believe that the gross margin continued to be impacted by a promotional environment.



Also, the company recorded operating loss of $3.8 million, wider than the prior-year loss of $1.6 million. This could be accountable to higher depreciation and operating expenses, which resulted from escalated labor and advertising costs. Additionally, the company incurred greater store occupancy expenses, as a percentage of sales. Also, the company witnessed higher outbound freight costs (including e-commerce shipping) and elevated central distribution expenses, which were impacted by supply chain hurdles.



Store Updates



The company introduced 10 stores and shuttered one in the quarter, taking the total store count to 415.



For fiscal 2017, management intends to open 31 new stores and close 16 stores, with a goal of attaining square footage improvement of 5%.



Other Financial Details



Kirkland's exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 million and deferred rent and other long-term liabilities of $64.1 million. Further, net shareholders' equity as of Oct 28, came in at $127.8 million.



During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, Kirkland used cash flow from operating activities of $12.3 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $23.6 million on a year-to-date basis.



For fiscal 2017, the company anticipates capital expenditures to range between $27 million and $29 million, mainly owing to store openings and constant investments in omni-channel capacities and supply chain efficiencies. Also, the renewed capital expenditure outlook includes impacts of rebuilding expenses associated with hurricanes and greater store count.



Kirkland’s bought back 19,000 shares at an average price of $11.52 million during the third quarter.



Fiscal 2017 Guidance



Management remains pleased with its third-quarter performance, which was driven by efforts to control SKU’s, enhance assortments and optimize promotional activities. The company remains particularly impressed with the comps growth despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes. The company further stated that it began the fourth quarter on a solid note, with its holiday season assortments and marketing efforts in place. With its holiday season plans gaining traction, it remains optimistic about its fourth quarter prospects.



Kirkland’s now anticipates net sales growth at the higher end of its previously forecasted range of 6-8%, reflecting the impact of the 53rd week. Also, this guidance is based on comps growth in a range of flat to 2% rise. Earlier, management projected comps growth in a range of slightly negative to slightly positive.



However, Kirkland’s narrowed its earnings guidance range, owing to hurricanes, supply chain disruptions and higher expected tax rate. Management now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings to be 50-60 cents per share, in comparison with the old guidance range of 50-65 cents per share.

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistan-frees-hafiz-saeed-alleged-mastermind-mumbai-attacks-n823731Pakistan frees Hafiz Saeed, alleged mastermind of Mumbai attacksISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistani authorities on Friday released the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head.

Hafiz Saeed, whose house arrest in January was seen as a signal of a broader shift in Pakistan’s treatment of extremists, was freed before dawn the city of Lahore, according to Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a spokesman for the Islamist cleric's charity.

"I’m happy that no allegation against me was proved, which could have done damage to me, or my country’s interests," Saeed later told supporters. "Thank God, we were vindicated."

Saeed ran the Jamaat-Ud-Dawa organization (Party of the Faith), which is thought to be a front for the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba militant group. India believes that Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was behind the deadly attack in Mumbai.

Pakistan has been detaining and freeing Saeed off and on since the attacks that left 166 dead, including several Americans.

His release came after a panel of judges dismissed a government request to continue his house arrest, which ended Thursday. Four aides had already been released.

Placing Saeed under house arrest earlier this year was driven in part by President Donald Trump’s arrival on the world stage as well as pressure from China, according to military insiders.

India's External Affairs Ministry condemned the release, and said in a statement that a "self-confessed and U.N. proscribed terrorist was being allowed to walk free and continue with his evil agenda."

"He was not only the mastermind, he was the prime organizer of the Mumbai terror attacks in which many innocent Indians and many people from other nationalities were killed," spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement.

Kumar said Saeed's "release confirms once again the lack of seriousness on the part of Pakistani government in bringing to justice perpetrators of heinous acts of terrorism."

Like much of Pakistan's establishment, Saeed was virulently anti-India, and campaigned against New Delhi’s occupation of the disputed territory of Kashmir for years.

Often a guest on conservative television talks shows, the popular jihadist still attracts large crowds with his anti-American and anti-Indian diatribes in rallies and protests.

Even though Pakistan has been involved in extensive counter-terror and counterinsurgency operations against al Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban and ISIS — the military says it has lost more than 7,000 soldiers battling terrorists since Sept. 11, 2001 — it is often blamed for selectively harboring certain other militant groups.

These include elements of the deadly Haqqani network in Afghanistan, the leadership of the Afghan Taliban, as well as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.

Saeed's release could once again sour U.S. relations with nuclear-armed Islamabad, which had seen an apparent improvement after the rescue by Pakistan’s military of American hostage Caitlan Coleman and her family on Oct. 13.

"This is a positive moment for our country's relationship with Pakistan," President Donald Trump said in a statement after Coleman was freed. "The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region."

Islamabad-Washington ties deteriorated during Trump’s first months in office.

In August, he warned that Pakistan had “much to lose” if it failed to cooperate with the U.S. in neighboring Afghanistan. He also expressed a desire to see India — Pakistan’s archrival — become an active stakeholder in stabilizing Afghanistan.

Before becoming president, Trump criticized Pakistan and said in a tweet: "Get it straight: Pakistan is not our friend. We’ve given them billions and billions of dollars, and what did we get? Betrayal and disrespect—and much worse. #TimeToGetTough"

For years, the Pakistanis have been blamed by the U.S. for not doing enough in their counterterrorism efforts to end the Afghan war — the longest military engagement in America's history. Islamabad has rejected the criticism, saying it has also suffered being an ally of Washington in the war against terror.-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-fourth-estate-defining-public-interest-in-the-age-of-twitter_uk_5a1581cee4b0815d3ce65b94The Fourth Estate: Defining 'Public Interest' In The Age Of TwitterIs there a gulf between what we care about and what’s actually being reported by news outlets?

Cynics have always told us that the biases of particular media outlets reflect the private motivations and interests of media owners. While in the past we could only speculate on the social concerns that the media might be ignoring or under-reporting, we now have data that can shed more light on the divide.

Using our MeaningMine data analytics engine, we collect and analyse over eight million online sources (including all Tier 1 media) and over 30 million social media posts every day allowing us to identify and compare the political themes that real people talk about on social media with the topics selected for our attention by editors and publishers of news sites all over the world.

The insights and implications are diverse and we couldn’t possibly hope to cover them in just one blog, but by highlighting some examples, we hope to demonstrate that the data reveals some intriguing divides which suggest a fully rounded picture of events and opinion can only really be derived from accessing a diverse range of sources.

Protests lead the way

In recent weeks, the data has shown that activism and protest have galvanised sections of the public in many different countries, generating widespread attention and high levels of both social and mainstream media coverage and conversation.

Stories include the jailing of Ecuador’s Vice President Jorge Glas following bribery allegations, the ‘anti authoritarian rule’ march in Hong Kong, electoral reform protests in Kenya and pro and anti-independence marches in Catalonia. So far, so similar: public energy and editorial agendas seem to be aligned.

Gender cover fails to live up to our interest

However when it comes to the politics of gender and sexuality, we see notable differences in coverage. These topics are the second most popular theme on social media after protest and activism. By comparison, across mainstream media, gender issues are much further down the agenda, as the sixth most discussed theme.

When we dig into the data, we see that many social media posts relate to state persecution of the gay community, including mass arrests in Egypt after an ‘LGBT crackdown’, plus discussion about the USA’s vote against the UN resolution to condemn the death penalty as punishment for homosexuality, and reactions to Saudi Arabia lifting the ban on female drivers.

Could this discrepancy simply be a case of many news outlets misjudging the public’s interest, and failing to give these stories the space they deserve?

Travel stories fail to take off

On the other hand, there are topics that seem to be given more media coverage than public interest seems to warrant. For example, online news sources are full of travel-related stories, including the recovery of Monarch passengers after the airline’s collapse, that simply aren’t generating an equivalent social media buzz. While travel topics made up 2.5% of all mainstream media coverage, bringing it in as the fourth most popular theme, on social media it was a lowly seventh with just 0.2% of attention.

It seems that while news media can be highly focused on stories related to big business, the public is often more keen to discuss overtly socio-political themes like oppressive regimes and state violence.

Gaps and overlaps

Who sets the agenda in a world of ambient, always-on news, where everyone can be a publisher and anyone can find an audience? In this era of political crises, natural disasters and horrific acts of violence, it’s more important than ever to understand how the editorial choices of mainstream news media may differ from or respond to topics of public interest articulated on social media and indeed elsewhere.

The differences revealed in the data raise intriguing questions about the shape and driving forces of digital conversations as well as profound challenges for organisations and individuals in the public eye, be they corporate, political or otherwise.

In the election of Donald Trump and the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, social media proved a more accurate indicator of how public interest would impact political reality than mainstream media. But ‘fake news’ and the ‘content farms’ that seek to generate and weaponise fabricated stories to influence opinion on social media are neglected at society’s peril.

One thing is for sure, the success with which professional media and indeed citizen journalists navigate this landscape to hold up a mirror to society in all its complexity will have profound implications for the real world in which we live long after individual articles are forgotten.0

A UK watchdog has made major changes to the way internet providers can advertise their broadband packages, after research showed customers were being “misled”.

Having access to fast broadband might seem like a first-world problem, but the UK government has said they want to see it as a ‘legal right’ for citizens to have a minimum level access of 10Mbps by 2020.

As Ofcom predicts around 1.4 million homes are still getting speeds below this benchmark, clearly providers have some role to play in this long-term strategy.

ASA’s new rules require that all advertised speeds must be based on the download speeds available to 50% of customers at ‘peak hours’ (rather than say, in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep).

Previous guidelines only required 10% of customers needed to have access to that speed at that time.

They have also got stricter on the language used on billboards, saying that providers now need to make it clear these speeds are an “average” rather than the current position that allows them to use the words “up to”.

According to ASA, this was leaving consumers open to misinterpreting this as the speed they are “likely to get as individuals” as opposed to what the nation is likely to get as a whole.

The new rules kick in on 23 May 2018, after a six-month implementation period.

Although there’s no doubt that some marketing was purposefully making things ambiguous for customers, ISPs do face the problem that every home is different and therefore impossible to calculate precisely.

Shahriar Coupal, director of the Committees of Advertising Practice said: “There are a lot of factors that affect the broadband speed a customer is going to get in their own home - from technology to geography, to how a household uses broadband.”1

The environment secretary also took aim at the way the argument has been portrayed on social media, saying the facts had been distorted. Many mocked the Brexiteer’s attack on inaccurate reporting, pointing to the Leave campaign bus, which, prior to the June 2016 referendum, incorrectly boasted that departing the EU would give the UK £350 million a week.

Empics Entertainment Michael Gove dismissed claims that MPs voted against the notion that animals are sentient.

A row erupted in the wake of last Friday’s vote, which saw the government reject an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill which would have transferred part of the Lisbon Treaty into UK law. Article 13 from the Lisbon Treaty recognises that animals are sentient and puts the onus on the state to take into account animal welfare when formulating and implementing policies in areas such as agriculture, fisheries and transport. Gove has said that “no one in the House of Commons disagrees” that animals are sentient, but added that it would have created “legal uncertainty” if MPs had included the protocol in the withdrawal bill. “On social media there was a suggestion that MPs had somehow voted against the notion that animals are sentient beings. That did not happen. That was absolutely wrong,” the Tory minister told BBC Radio 4′s Today programme on Friday.

Animals should be recognised as emotional beings. Parliament voted not to include #animalsentience in the EU (Withdrawal) Bill as they believe it is mentioned in the Animal Welfare Act - but it's not, and it doesn't cover every species. Help us fight: https://t.co/U6L0Aa4Jim pic.twitter.com/1SEvzy4Yjl — RSPCA (England & Wales) (@RSPCA_official) November 21, 2017

When queried why Parliament didn’t bring across the protocol and then add to it later, Gove said: “It’s better to have an absolutely well designed piece of UK legislation rather than a poorly designed piece of EU legislation.” Gove pointed to the ways in which the government has already strengthened animal welfare, such as moving to install CCTV in slaughterhouses, increasing sentences for animal cruelty and banning sales of ivory. The Brexit campaigner said that the UK’s departure from the EU could lead to stronger animal welfare measures in areas such as live exports and puppy farming. Gove said that he expects there will be additional safeguards for animals written into the Animal Welfare Act 2006 before the UK leaves the EU. “What we’re going to do is to ensure that we have stronger protection written into law in order to ensure that there is no gap. “We will ensure that there is no gap in the operation of the law, and there is no way in which animal protection can be diminished in any way, in any shape, or in any form,” Gove added. The senior Tory MP also criticised the way the debate had been portrayed on social media, claiming the vote had been “unfairly represented”. “There’s an unhappy tendency now for people to believe that the raw and authentic voice that’s shared on social media is more reliable than what is said on Hansard or on the BBC,” he said. “We have got to stand up against the way in which social media corrupts and distorts both reporting and decision making.”

The Telegraph reports that while May will confirm her offer to increase our divorce bill payments, the EU is playing hardball and insisting on written guarantees. There’s word too that May could have a bilateral meeting with Angela Merkel in the margins of today’s meeting.

The day after our own Budget forecast gloom, the FT reports that the eurozone economy powered ahead in November, with 17-year highs in new manufacturing orders and jobs growth. And Irish broadcaster RTE has a leaked document showing EU officials think the UK’s Brexit negotiations have been chaotic and incoherent, branding Boris Johnson ‘unimpressive’. Ian Forrester, the British judge on the European Court of Justice for the past two years, candidly told Irish diplomats that there were “issues around the quality of politicians in Westminster at present” and that ministers still don’t ‘grasp’ the complexity of quitting the EU.

Michael Gove was on the Today programme and was very reluctant to confirm the Cabinet had agreed to up its financial offer, stating only that “I think the Prime Minister has the right negotiating stance”. But the Sun reports that Gove has won a Cabinet battle with Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd to allow the UK to make a ‘clean break’ with EU regulations even in a transitional period. A Cabinet source told the paper: “We’ll be bringing EU regulations into UK law when we leave, but thereafter we’ll want to diverge. We won’t be rule takers. The Prime Minister is now of that view, along with Michael and Boris.” The words ‘thereafter’ and ‘want to’ could be crucial. Many ministers believe ‘divergence’ will be more theoretical than actual for two years, just as our new ‘control’ over immigration may still see roughly the same numbers coming into the UK. The exact terms of the transition itself is a whole other battle due to be waged early in the New Year, but shots have been fired by the Brexiteers.

International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is another who wants more flexibility during a transition/implementation period. And today he has built on his previous complaint that some British firms had become “too lazy and too fat” within the comfy confines of EU. He tells The House magazine: “I can agree as many trade agreements as I like, but if British business doesn’t want to export, then that doesn’t do us any good.” The DUP’s annual conference takes place tomorrow and will see more journos present than ever before. But anyone expecting swivel-eyed, angry Ulstermen talking about social issues like abortion and gay rights are likely to be disappointed. A hard line on Brexit, in Gove and Fox style, could be the main story.0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/23/europe/holocaust-memorial-german-politician/index.htmlHolocaust memorial built outside home of German politician(CNN) Political activists built a replica of Berlin's Holocaust Memorial outside the home of a far-right German politician to protest his call for Germany to stop feeling guilty about Nazi atrocities.

The Center for Political Beauty erected 24 large concrete slabs next to the house of Alternative for Germany (AfD) politician Björn Höcke, to serve as a reminder of the six million Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust.

The plan was first conceived in the aftermath of Höcke's controversial Dresden speech in which he said that Germans were the "only people in the world who planted a memorial of shame in the heart of their capital," referring to the 2,711 gray blocks that were first unveiled in Berlin in 2005.

Höcke also said Germany needed to make a "180-degree turn'' when remembering its past and labeled the country's citizens as "brutally defeated people." He later described criticism of his remarks "a malicious and deliberately denigratory interpretation" of them.

Located in the state of Himachal Pradesh in northern India, this small village has witnessed a boom in popularity among international paragliders after it hosted the Paragliding World Cup in 2015.

"Paragliding has made this village famous. Otherwise, very few people knew about it," says Arvind Paul, a paragliding instructor.

"The local community has benefited a lot from it. 100% of the locals are farmers, but this is a good side-business for us, because during the rainy season there is no work here."

http://cnn.com/2017/11/24/opinions/has-trump-changed-dc-robertson-opinion/index.htmlDonald Trump's DC is a chilly placeNic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author.

When I last came to Washington in January days after Donald Trump's inauguration , the city was the epitome of pull power.

Theresa May had dashed over from London to be the first world leader to congratulate Trump face to face. They even held hands.

Now, 10 months later, despite May extending the Queen's offer of a State visit to the UK -- the pomp and pageantry of which would no doubt delight Trump -- he has not taken up the offer.

There is a chill on the "special relationship." Indeed, the 45th President is having a significant cooling effect on most of America's international relationships.

Returning this week to DC for Thanksgiving -- my wife is American and one of my daughters studies here -- the nation's capital feels as though it pushes more than it pulls -- keeping the world and its leaders at arm's length.

One former career public servant told me that the country's global standing as a power for good is being undermined by the Trump White House.

According to several DC insiders I've met, cutbacks and firings are leaving many feeling they are fighting the good fight of American interests overseas with one hand tied behind their back, led by a boss who is out of his depth.

The day I arrived in DC State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert was addressing this very issue, saying : "it breaks my heart to hear some feel they aren't needed or aren't wanted or aren't appreciated"

Wendy Sherman, a former undersecretary of state for political affairs and a principle architect of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, is scathing in her condemnation of Trump. "Quite frankly, this administration is categorically destroying the Department of State and devaluing diplomacy as something important in this world."

For many veterans of US diplomacy, DC has come adrift of its moorings.

In recent months, the pace of big-name leaders touching down in Washington has slackened. Early-season visits by Xi Jinping, Shinzo Abe, Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau have passed.

Theresa May is not the only international leader to have discovered President Trump is in fact Candidate Trump and that he heads an America in retreat. No longer is America seen by all as the unshakable standard bearer for free trade and democracy.

One of the first international umbilical cords on Trump's chopping block was US membership of the TPP -- the 12 nation Trans Pacific Partnership that not only sought a multinational trade pact, but did so to make stronger diplomatic partners of the member nations in that region specifically to push back against China's growing influence.

Trump's impulse to read the TPP as simply a trade deal disadvantaging America blew up in his face on his recent Asia tour. While he was still in Vietnam attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit his host -- along with Japan's Abe, who had hosted him days earlier in Tokyo -- signed the TPP deal without Trump and America.

America's influence is thereby diminished.

It was a diplomatic slapdown coming just one day after Trump told the Vietnamese, Abe and the other APEC leaders America was open for bilateral trade deals. Trump's America First policy came in second that day.

The open arms of DC diplomacy are gone. A rather more barbed "America First" glowers from the ramparts of the White House -- and the capital's residents are living this.

From driver to teacher to researcher to student to journalist to civil servant, many I talked to feel ill at ease with the effects of that America First policy so far.

And Trump's agitation of the status quo comes at a bad time.

The post World War Two order that has been steady for several generations is getting wobbly. China's expansions; Russia's invasions and meddling; Iran and Saudi locking horns; rising populist nationalism.

Right now the world needs a rock, and Trump's America offers anything but. Indeed, where most of the world is aligned on global warming, Trump is not.

"Yes," one Washington insider told me, the universe does still revolve around DC. But it does so now in bigger and bigger orbits, father and farther away.

From tiny acorns mighty oaks grow, and DC embodies all of that. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial above the reflecting pool, Martin Luther's immortal words have a resting place chiseled into the stone: "I have a dream."

A few steps away, above Lincoln's huge statue, passively powerful in his armchair repose, the words carved in the wall above him speak of the love of his citizens for his unifying if troubled leadership:

"In this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."

If ever there were a message that today feels like it belongs to a bygone era, this is it. Because for all their eloquence, these are only words carved in stone, not set in it. Today they seem to lack permanence.

They are not commandments to which Trump is tethering his Presidency.

An analogy doing the rounds in DC that a former career public servant drew my attention to hints at the depth of anger, frustration and division. Presidential historian Robert Dallek is quoted as saying: "A fish rots from the head downwards ... and the stench of this administration starts at the very top."

To this outsider arriving after almost a year's absence such language is a shocking indictment of the erosion of civility in political discourse. It is exactly the attitude that will upset Trump and many Republicans, but reveals just how bitter recriminations are set to become.

DC's worldly ties are being severed. The State Department not only has a hiring freeze, but is short-staffed and lacks the hands to answer all the calls coming its way.

One European told me he has taken to having journalists to dinner in the hope they can enlighten him as to what is going on.

But it's not just diplomats who notice how DC's international buzz is ebbing. It's the everyday people in tough everyday jobs whose hard graft keeps the capital ticking who are also noticing the change.

Trump's domestic policies on undocumented migrants have teachers wondering which of the Dreamers won't show up for class next week. At universities, students on the verge of graduating and giving back what society has given them are now kept awake by worries of deportation to countries they no longer know.

His failure to see white supremacists for what they are and apparent ability to see Muslims for what they are not, coupled with poorly conceived travel bans, play badly in DC's melting-pot society.

Even a short cab ride with someone from a migrant family quickly becomes a conversation about the damage they fear Trump is doing to society.

Many left homes halfway round the world to raise families here. And they chose to come because they wanted to be part of the American dream.

Washington feels less international because of Trump's rhetoric and policies.

Overseas embassies here, the diplomatic lifeblood of DC, aren't shuttering their doors just yet. But they are battening down the hatches, hoping better days will come.0

Erick Castro started out bussing tables at La Fogata, his family’s Mexican restaurant in Hemet, California. Up in the high desert, right between LA and Palm Springs. From his early days, “I was fascinated by the idea of anybody sticking it to the man. People who were rebellious but in a productive manner.”

He’s a Mexican-American whose parents came over to America on the Bracero Program, which helped immigrant workers get green cards—a program that sounds like an old-fashioned fairy tale given the current political climate. Castro grew up in a home filled with the aromas of fresh corn tortillas and traditional Mexican music on the radio. So what does he think about said political climate?

He doesn’t want to talk about it. Not one word.

I can’t figure out if Castro is just giving me the face that all career bartenders have—the smile that allows them to serve you even when you’re obnoxious or sloppy drunk. He isn't just a career bartender, though. He owns two bars, Polite Provisions in San Diego and Boilermaker in New York, has spent the last year hustling “Bartender at Large,” the documentary he shot with his wife Amelia; has his own podcast of the same name; is shooting another doc; and used to be a booze rep.

A bartender at Polite Provisions.

That last one is the clincher; the prerequisite for nailing a booze rep gig is the face you give. He basically has a master’s degree in hail fellow well met. He can do smiling bartender face at me all night. And he seems to be doing just that. He’s talking about Polite Provisions and how diverse the clientele is; they get seniors from the retirement home nearby, kids from his alma mater SD State, “people getting off work, people heading to work. It is the best of San Diego, it’s why I love this city so much.”

Sounds like boilerplate stuff, but then he slips in something that gives me a clue into the kind of guy I’m dealing with.

“The economy in the service sector with restaurants isn’t doing really well right now. We want to create an atmosphere where we take care of our people, so we provide healthcare. We cover 75% of the cost.”

WATCH: MUNCHIES Guide to Mexico: La Marquesa

In the wild west of the bar scene, where employees can go home with hundreds of dollars in cash at the end of a shift, a place where the strict workplace rules that govern the 9–5 world of the daywalkers might not seem to apply, he’s giving them healthcare.

I ask him if that’s typical, to offer health insurance, in the American bar industry (I’m Canadian. This isn’t a thing for us.).“Not at all, but we have good people and we want to keep them. I employ a lot of young people and I remember when I was in my 20s I thought I was invincible,” he says, smiling. “To them, I don’t think it’s a big deal, but I like knowing we have it. If something happens, I have the reassurance that they are taken care of.”

He’s political all right, he’s just quiet about it.

Tacos el Gordo.

Then he takes me to Tacos el Gordo. There is a line out the door—lots of guys in army fatigues, and old people and kids.

We sit behind the al pastor station; there is a table of Coast Guard guys behind us. Castro tells me about Thanksgiving at his house when he was growing up.

“We had pumpkin pie, turkey, stuffing and all that, but there’ll still be tortillas and tamales. The next day my mom will make rolled tacos out of mashed potatoes and turkey, it’s great.”

Castro waves his arm to encompass the restaurant and its environs, “This used to be Mexico. There are a lot of Mexican families who live here who have been here for generations who never decided to be American. 150 years ago they were just living here and the US was like 'here’s the border.' And they were like, 'I guess we’re American now.' It was never a conscious decision. We didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us. My bar is a 15 minute ride from the border. It’s pretty common for people to live on both sides. That’s why it kind of irks me when people talk disparagingly about immigrants in this country. I feel like we contribute so much to the economy that it’s silly to say that we don’t belong.”

Tacos at Tacos el Gordo.

He explains that California was part of Spain and Mexico longer than it was part of America and that’s why the Mexican influence is so profound. “These were families that were left without a country and became citizens of a place they never moved to.”

He says all this calmly. His demeanor does not belie the fire in his eyes though. But maybe that’s just from the fucking hot sauce.

Holy mother of God. I choke out a question about why he named his bar Polite Provisions. It’s just something to divert his attention while I try to mop up my tears, but his answer actually opens a window into who this guy is: “If you went on a road trip in the 1960s, as you went from state to state, you would discover different sodas, different candy bars, different snacks...We wanted to resurrect that time and those traditions and bring them back to the bar.”



A Raspberry Sulfate at Polite Provisions.

So his bar has a soda fountain inspired by 60s Americana, and health insurance for the staff. Castro is as American as apple pie, or mashed potatoes and turkey rolled up in a taco. He is San Diego’s George Bailey and his is a quiet rebellion.

CHICAGO/GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Nov 24 (Reuters) - Relatively few early-morning shoppers turned out on Black Friday to mark the start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, as more people picked up deals online and the traditional rush was split by stores opening the night before.

The period between the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas can make or a break a retailer, accounting for as much as 40 percent of total revenue for the year. The day after Thanksgiving is traditionally when retailers offer "doorbuster" deals attracting frenzied bargain hunters.

There was little sign of frenzy early on Friday.

About 250 people line up patiently at a Target Corp store in Manhattan before it opened at 6 a.m. (1100 GMT).

Tricia Welch, 36, a customer service executive at a bank, stood in line for about an hour before getting into the store.

"There are definitely more discounts available through the year now than say four to five years ago ... we only buy electronics or appliances on Black Friday."

Miguel Flores, 43, an overnight security guard, visited the store after his shift ended.

"I mostly shop online but decided to drop in because I haven’t been to a store in a long time," Flores said. "I bought some video games for my nephew a few days ago. The deals were pretty good then, too. In fact I was just looking at some of them today and the deals are similar."

Enticing shoppers with deals this Black Friday is especially important for brick-and-mortar retailers given the continued switch to online shopping, which has forced chains such as Toys R Us, apparel retailers True Religion, The Limited, Rue 21 and off-price retailer Payless Shoe Source to file for bankruptcy this year.

Major retail companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Target Corp, Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney opened their stores on Thursday evening and most have been offering extended holiday deals online starting as early as October instead of limiting them to one day. Some started offering in-store deals earlier this week to whet shoppers' appetites.

U.S. shoppers had spent more than $1.52 billion online by Thanksgiving evening, a 16.8 percent year-over-year increase in online spending, by 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) on Thanksgiving, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracked 80 percent of online transactions at the top 100 U.S. retailers.

https://sports.yahoo.com/broncos-cut-guy-being-fights-113941357.htmlBroncos cut a guy for being late, get in fights in practiceThe Broncos did their best on Thanksgiving to prove they’re not soft.

Perhaps someday it will carry over into a game.

According to Jeff Legwold of ESPN.com, an eventful day for the 3-7 Broncos included cutting a draft pick for being late to a team meeting, and having a practice which included a number of fights between players.

The Broncos released cornerback Lorenzo Doss, a 2015 fifth-rounder who has a reputation for being late. He had played in three games this year and was inactive for the other seven, and Broncos coach Vance Joseph was succinct when asked about his release.

“We’re just trying to get better as a football team, simply put,” he said.

Moss marks the third player released in the last nine days, a time span which coincides with their six-game losing streak, firing the offensive coordinator, benching another quarterback, and being referred to as “soft” by executive John Elway.

So their practice reflected a team trying to disprove that notion, as cornerback Chris Harris Jr. and rookie wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie were involved in one of the two fights.

“It’s not a good mood at all,” Harris said of the team as a whole. “We lost seven straight, it’s not a good mood at all.”

While his math is off, the theme is correct, and the frustration is beginning to show.-1

The gain is slightly better than the 15.3% in the S&P 500, while long-time rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) has gone nowhere.

There is a good reason for Morgan Stanley’s move. Margins are much higher than they were early in the decade, about 15% on average. In 2013 and 2014 these were below 10%. But the gains have been consistent since 2015, while the top line has stayed within a $50 million range since 2013.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It would seem the rising tide of the market is now lifting investment banking and Morgan Stanley stock. The price to earnings ratio for MS stock is now near 14, up substantially from a year ago, and analysts pounding the table for it (most say buy it) think things will get even better.

Trouble Free 2017

Investment banking rises and falls with the economic tides. When times are tough, the investment banks have trouble. When times are flush, they usually do very well.

Times are good now, especially at Morgan Stanley. They’re beating Goldman Sachs at the commodity game for the first time in years, one reason why that rival stock has been stuck in neutral.

While fintech is roiling the market for credit cards, loans and deposits, the complexity of what Morgan Stanley does resists automation, says CEO James Gorman.

But if times are so good why is Morgan Stanley tying down its talent, leaving a broker protocol with 1,700 signatories that let brokers take their client names with them when they left?







It all sounds like a bank that is battening down the hatches, fearful of the future. Don’t pay attention to those Bitcoin millionaires behind the curtain.

Trouble Ahead

One way Morgan makes money is by advising clients about other companies, telling them to buy Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or sell General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Changes in its ratings are often self-fulfilling prophecies.

But what about Morgan Stanley itself? The old brokerage game of “wealth management,” investing rich people’s money for them, is proving to be a gold mine, and could represent 10% of the bank’s revenue this year.

But Morgan Stanley itself is saying the bull market may be about to end. It sees too much leverage in the economy, too much exuberance among investors and a high likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.

Stocks will rise sharply until they don’t, they warn, sounding more like this journalist every day.

The Bottom Line for MS Stock

I personally see a different catalyst ending the bull run, namely the tax cut debate.

If it ends with a “loss” for the Trump Administration, stocks will fall because traders are expecting a win. If it ends with a “win,” stocks will fall because the bill takes money out of the things people invest in, and puts it into cash.

Cash that can’t find a return, cash that can’t be put to work, doesn’t grow. It tends to fall in value, both in comparison with other currencies and against inflation.

Already, Morgan Stanley notes, a flattening yield curve is making it harder for money to make money passively. What happens when you pile more money on top of that?

What happens is that, as in my case, money becomes unemployed. Money that is unemployed is no use to anyone. Even to Morgan Stanley. Markets that lock up on imbalances fall, destroying value. The company is already warning this may happen.

Take them at their word.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petmed-pets-down-7-8-131601014.htmlPetMed (PETS) Down 7.8% Since Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?PetMed (PETS) reported earnings about a month ago. What's next for the stock? We take a look at earnings estimates for some clues.

About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS). Shares have lost about 7.8% in that time frame.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock’s next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Recent Earnings

PetMed announced earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 79.2% from the year-ago quarter’s 24 cents. Also, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 43.3%.



The year-over-year rise in earnings was driven by an increase in sales and improved margins.



Net sales in the reported quarter rose 10% year over year to $66.7 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.9%.



Per this leading pet pharmacy in Americas, the upside in sales was a result of increased new orders and reorders during the quarter.



In the reported quarter, reorder sales increased 9.9% to $55.1 million on a year-over-year basis, while new order sales rose 8.8% to $11.6 million.



Average order value was approximately $85 in the quarter compared with $82 in the year-ago quarter. We note that the variation in average order value is mainly driven by a shift of sales to higher priced items.



Per the company, the seasonality in its business is mainly because of the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons while fall and winter represent off-seasons.



During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 134,000 new customers, up from 131,000 a year ago. Roughly, 84% of all orders was generated from its website (versus 82% in the prior-year quarter).



Gross margin expanded 548 basis points (bps) year over year to 35.2% in the reported quarter. General and administrative expenses were up 7.5% year over year to $6.2 million.

Also, advertising expenses rose 3.3% to $4.5 million. This led to a 5.6% increase in adjusted operating expenses (without depreciation expense), which amounted to $10.7 million. Nevertheless, adjusted operating margin in the quarter rose 610 bps to 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.



PetMed exited the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $68.4 million compared with $68.5 million at the end of the first-quarter fiscal 2017. The company also announced a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share, payable to shareholders of record as of Nov 17, 2017.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter.

VGM Scores

At this time, the stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregte VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

The company's stock is suitable soley for growth based on our styles scores.

Outlook

Estimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions also looks promising. It comes with little surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-great-stock-value-144002583.htmlIs Verizon Communications a Great Stock for Value Investors?Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?



One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Verizon Communications Inc. VZ stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:



PE Ratio



A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.



On this front, Verizon Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.3, as you can see in the chart below:







This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Verizon Communications’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.







Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.







We should point out that Verizon Communications has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 12.3, which is in line with the current level. Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company’s current share price.



P/S Ratio



Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.



Right now, Verizon Communications has a P/S ratio of about 1.5. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.







As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.



Broad Value Outlook



In aggregate, Verizon Communications currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Verizon Communications a solid choice for value investors.



What About the Stock Overall?



Though Verizon Communications might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D. This gives VZ a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)



Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to nine lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and nine downward revisions in the same time period.



As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 3.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:

https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/24/joe-root-ashes-england-meticulous-approachJoe Root’s meticulous approach pays Ashes dividends for England | Ali MartinDeveloping strategies for each member of an opposition is hardly revolutionary but when such work bears fruit it is nevertheless worth tipping the hat to the brains trust behind it

Joe Root may never be able to sport a beard as thick as the one that led to Mike Brearley dubbed the Ayatollah during the 1978-79 Ashes but when it comes to assessing his first experience of captaining England in Australia, some encouraging growth can be reported.

It was a hard-fought second day here, with the absorbing wrestle for control continuing to unfold and belie predictions of the cricket being one-way traffic on Vulture Street. Root’s fingerprints could be found on much of what was good about England’s performance.

Smith stands tall to keep first Ashes Test in balance after England apply pressure Read more

His ascendancy to the captaincy at the start of the year had brought with it an element of the unknown. Though much of the talk was of him being proactive and aggressive, it felt based on the assumption that his personality and batting style would simply translate across.

After all, and in keeping with the modern way, Root was light on prior domestic experience at Yorkshire. It was always going to be a case of learning on the job, with seven home Tests in just over eight weeks a short, sharp cramming session before the examination of an away Ashes tour.

But, like his returns with willow in hand, the end result appears to be as much about his meticulous approach to preparation as a good eye, with plenty of time before this series spent bunkered down with Shane Bond, England’s short-term bowling consultant, the pair poring over the statistics and wagon wheels in the search for frailties.

Developing strategies for each member of an opposition is hardly revolutionary in itself, but when such work bears fruit – as could be seen in the Australian wickets claimed on the second day – it is worth tipping the hat to the brains trust behind it.

Take the dismissal of Usman Khawaja, a batsman so home and away in terms of his Test returns he could easily be nicknamed Alf Stewart. When Cameron Bancroft, the debutant opener, nicked off to Stuart Broad in the fourth over, Root wasted little time – and cared not for the fleeting shine of the Kookaburra ball – before introducing Moeen Ali into the attack.

Khawaja is a dominant force on Australian soil when taking on the quicks. But an achilles heel against the spinners, one that means he is not trusted in the subcontinent, was identified by England and when Moeen ripped his first ball to the left‑hander past the outside edge, before trapping him plumb lbw next up, it was as much a win for the captain as the bowler.

David Warner, meanwhile, was being starved of the strike, with his favoured brawny cut reduced to a shot for one by a sweeper in the deep. Though it may have appeared a negative move by Root, it preyed on ego and in attempting to a force short-arm pull off Jake Ball, the aggressive opener could only pick out Dawid Malan stationed at midwicket.

The challenge of Peter Handscomb comes in trying to work out the right‑hander’s homespun technique of sitting deep in his crease – one that has previously confused bowlers in a promising start to his Test career. Though Ball became the latest to be baffled during the exchanges before tea as the right-hander carved 11 off an over, Jimmy Anderson found a way after the break.

In all the hoopla that came in the weeks and days leading into this series, a curious omission from much of the analysis was that Root has the world’s No1 bowler at his disposal. On a day when Anderson bowled with impeccable control, a full straight delivery with the ball undercut in release crashed into the right-hander’s pads to make it 76 for four.

As Australia’s resurgence to 165 for four by stumps suggests, Root did not have it all his own way. At times Moeen felt a touch overbowled – Nathan Lyon, whose control allows Australia a four‑man attack, is clearly the superior spinner at present – while Chris Woakes, after a strong showing in the warm-ups, was not at his best during his first away Ashes outing.

Smith, to whom additional leg-side cover was smartly placed in order to target the pads, was happy to play the long game and looked every bit the world’s best player, while Shaun Marsh, a veteran facing what is his final attempt at cracking Test cricket, was solid in support of his captain.

Root could not complain about the efforts of his players, however, with the feeling mutual after stumps. “He’s been excellent,” said Ball. “He has done a lot of research, he has his plans in his head and when things are quite going our way, he always has Plan B and Plan C. I can’t fault him.”0
https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/07/loneliest-city-in-worldWhat's the world's loneliest city?In Tokyo, you can rent a cuddle. Loneliness is a health issue in Manchester. And perhaps nobody is as isolated as a migrant worker in Shenzhen. But can we really know what makes a city lonely?

“New York has a trip-hammer vitality which drives you insane with restlessness, if you have no inner stabiliser,” wrote Henry Miller after moving back to the city following almost a decade in Paris. It could be expected that the Brooklyn-born novelist would have been happy to return, yet something didn’t sit right:



“In New York I have always felt lonely, the loneliness of the caged animal, which brings on crime, sex, alcohol and other madnesses.” Miller didn’t hurt for friends or charm – he was married five times – but he saw himself as an outsider, “forever and ever the ridiculous man, the lonely soul”, and it was his hometown that brought on this fever of loneliness.

Could Miller’s words be evidence that New York – where countless people have gone to find fame, work, love and even themselves – is the loneliest city in the world? Or is it possible that the person, not the place, was the source of Miller’s discontent? And if so, what is the loneliest city?



Urban life is more stressful than rural life, but whether it’s lonelier is a point of debate among social scientists. A 2016 report by Age UK noted there are higher incidences of loneliness in cities, but precisely what brings it on is surprising. The same report found that gender and education are largely irrelevant – except for those with the highest level of education, who are often lonelier – and that household income and caring for a pet also have little effect.

What matters is not whether we live alone, but whether we feel alone Eric Klinenberg

So what impacts loneliness, and how does that play out in cities? The size of a household inversely affects how you feel: the smaller the household, the more lonely it tends to be. And people who rent or own a home are lonelier than those with a mortgage, perhaps because cities with lots of renters – such as London, which is expected to have 60% of residents renting by 2025 – have greater transience, and potentially lower community engagement. New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco have rental figures hovering in the mid-50s. Renters dominate in German cities, too – a long-term trend attributed to low rents and housing policies, but one that may end up influencing neighbourhood engagement.

One thing is certain: the percentage of those who live alone has increased dramatically. In the US, 27% of people live alone, up from 5% in 1920, and in New York City it’s roughly one third. The same trend is evident in Canada, and even more pronounced in Europe – 58% of people in Stockholm live alone, a figure that is considered the highest in Europe. In many cities, the trend is here to stay. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that there will be 1.3m more single-occupancy households by 2025, a jump of roughly 60%, and one that could crowd major cities and affect access to affordable housing.

Obscured by those figures, however, is the assumption that living alone leads to loneliness – two things the sociologist Eric Klinenberg, author of Going Solo, says are often conflated. “In fact, there’s little evidence that the rise of living alone is responsible for making us lonely,” he wrote in 2012. “Research shows that it’s the quality, not the quantity of social interactions that best predicts loneliness. What matters is not whether we live alone, but whether we feel alone.”

The demographic that most reports feeling lonely are older people, and they do often live alone. In Stockholm, 35% of people over the age of 75 experienced loneliness, while in Bristol 10-15% reported the same. (Hence the slogan “Bristol: a brilliant place to grow old.”) Older people are likely to be more lonely in cities, especially if they are poorer, have physical or mental health issues or live in underprivileged areas.



Campaign to End Loneliness suggested that 7% of older people in the UK are lonely, while age researcher Thomas Scharf found that 16% of older people in deprived neighbourhoods in English cities were “severely lonely”. Manchester fared worse than Liverpool or London, which may explain why it is treating loneliness as an urban health issue: it created the Valuing Older People programme in 2003 to address, among other issues, loneliness and isolation. Similar projects have sprung up in other cities which recognise that loneliness runs tandem to issues such as segregation, housing, healthcare, and isolation among seniors and others vulnerable citizens.

But it’s not only older people who suffer from isolation. In Australia, city dwellers have fewer friends than they did two decades ago. In the US, a troubling one in five people said they had only one close friend. Or consider idyllic-looking Vancouver, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, which struggles not only with affordability (it was recently crowned the most expensive city in North America), but also with friendliness.



We can see other people living richer, more populated lives than our own. At the same time, we can feel very exposed Olivia Laing

The Vancouver Foundation thinktank asked community leaders and charities to identify the biggest issues facing Vancouverites and were told it wasn’t homelessness or poverty; it was isolation. Of 4,000 people from 80-odd ethnic groups who were polled, one third of respondents found it hard to make friends – something I discovered firsthand when I spent a rainy, grey winter working in Vancouver, wandering Stanley Park alone with my dog at weekends and sitting in crowded cafes by myself. In this young, diverse city, the newly arrived struggle most: among people who had been in Canada for five years or less, almost half (42%) had just two close friends.

A dearth of friendship doesn’t afflict only recent immigrants. Many Tokyoites long for friends so dearly that they’re willing to hire them. American writer Chris Colin, intrigued by Japanese “affection for hire” industries such as cuddle cafes and cat rentals, spent time with a service that provides temporary friends. The clientele was varied, he wrote: widowers, shy single types, “that one dude who just wanted a friend who’d do him the solid of waiting seven hours outside Nike to snag these fresh sneakers for him when they went on sale”. The largest of the rent-a-friend agencies, Client Partners, has eight branches in Tokyo alone.

Across the Sea of Japan, there’s a different problem: large-scale migration. As rural Chinese move to big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, they encounter isolation on an epic level. As of 2012, a staggering 230 million people had migrated from the countryside to cities. (More than half the country’s population now live in cities, up from one third in 1990.) Known as the “floating population”, they can find themselves in low-quality, high-density housing, subject to discrimination and at risk of low social participation, especially if they move frequently.

Researchers surveyed Chinese reports on community social networks, neighbourhood attachments and marginality and determined that migrants were more neighbourly – which may help them counteract isolation – but faced discrimination and, in some cases, grim living conditions: one corporation in the factory city Shenzhen houses more than 200,000 employees in dormitories, in which there’s been an epidemic of suicides. The report noted: “The ‘neighbourhood’ for them is likely to be the factory.” Yet in Beijing migrants had greater “neighbouring intensity” – in other words, they’re better at connecting with their community – suggesting that migrants may bring much-needed village values to the lonely urban jungle.

If life in China’s megacities illustrates anything, it might be that loneliness is often due to circumstance. This wouldn’t surprise Olivia Laing, whose new book, The Lonely City, chronicles a post-breakup stint in New York. “The thing with cities is we are absolutely surrounded by people,” Laing recently told the Globe and Mail. “We can see other people living richer, more populated lives than our own. At the same time, we can feel very exposed … there are lots of eyes on everyone. That is why the loneliness of the city has a particularly distinct tang to it.” Loneliness, however, is often like bad weather, “it passes through our lives”.

So are people in Shanghai or Berlin more solitary than those in Stockholm or Vancouver? I put the question to one of the field’s leading researchers, the University of Chicago’s John Cacioppo, who wrote the book on the subject, Loneliness. His research disputes the idea that urban life is inherently lonelier than rural life, and he declined to play favourites and pick just one city. “You raise an interesting question,” he says. “Unfortunately, we have no data with which to address it.” Maybe Laing is right that urban loneliness is ephemeral. Or perhaps we can learn from Henry Miller’s struggle with New York: in 1944, he packed his bags and moved to sunny Big Sur, California.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/24/technology/google-location-data-regulators/index.htmlGoogle questioned by regulators over location data collectionGoogle is facing scrutiny for reportedly collecting data about the location of smartphone users without their knowledge.

Regulators in South Korea summoned Google (GOOGL, Tech30) representatives this week to question them about a report that claimed the company was collecting data from Android devices even when location services were disabled.

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) "is carrying out an inquiry into the claims that Google collected users' Cell ID data without consent even when their smartphone's location service was inactive," Chun Ji-hyun, head of KCC's privacy infringement division, told CNNMoney on Friday.

U.K. data protection officials are also looking into the matter.

"Organizations are required by law to be transparent with consumers about what they are doing with personal information," said a spokesperson for the Information Commissioner's Office. "We are aware of the reports about the tracking system and are in contact with Google."

The probes follow a report by Quartz which found Android phones have been collecting addresses of nearby cellular towers. Those addresses were included in information, such as Cell ID codes, sent to Google for nearly a year.

Related: Amazon Key asks users to trade privacy for convenience

Google said the data was collected to improve notifications and message delivery, and was not stored on Google servers. Android phones are no longer requesting Cell ID codes, and collection should be phased out this month, it said.

"In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery," a Google spokesman said in a statement to CNNMoney.

Google never incorporated the data into its system, "so that data was immediately discarded, and we updated [the network system] to no longer request Cell ID," the spokesman added.

If Google collected Cell IDs without consent, the company may have violated South Korea's Location Data Protection Act, whether the data was stored on Google's U.S. servers or not, said Hwang Sun-chul, an official with KCC's commission's privacy infringement division.

An official investigation has not yet been launched, and more information will likely need to come from Google's U.S. headquarters, Hwang said.

Android phones dominate the global market. In South Korea, smartphones using Google's Android operating system, including Samsung (SSNLF) and LG (LPL) devices, account for more than 80% of the market, according to research firm IDC.0

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/at-least-85-people-killed-in-attack-on-mosque-in-egypts-north-sinai-state-news-agency.htmlAt least 155 people killed in attack on mosque in Egypt's north Sinai: State mediaAt least 155 people were killed and dozens more wounded when Islamist militants set off a bomb and opened fire on people attending prayers at a mosque in Egypt's restive northern Sinai on Friday, state media said.

No group claimed responsibility for the assault but it was the deadliest yet in the region where for three years Egyptian security forces have battled an Islamic State insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers.

State media showed images of bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of the city of El Arish. At least 85 people died and another 80 people were wounded, state news agency MENA reported.

"They were shooting at people as they left the mosque," a local resident whose relatives were at the scene told Reuters. "They were shooting at the ambulances too."

Arabiya news channel and some local sources said some of the worshippers were sufis who hardliners such as Islamic State regard as apostates because they revere saints and shrines, which for Islamists is tantamount to idolatry.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former armed forces commander who presents himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants in the region, convened an emergency security meeting soon after the attack, state television said.

Militants have mostly targeted security forces in their attacks since bloodshed in the Sinai worsened after 2013 when Sisi, then an armed forces commander, led the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.

But jihadists have also targeted local Sinai tribes that are working with the armed forces, branding them traitors for cooperating with the army and police.

In July this year, at least 23 soldiers were killed when suicide car bombs hit two military checkpoints in the Sinai, an attack claimed by Islamic State.

Militants have tried to expand beyond the largely barren, desert Sinai Peninsula into Egypt's heavily populated mainland, hitting Coptic Christian churches and pilgrims.

In May, gunmen attacked a Coptic group travelling to a monastery in southern

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-our-new-technology-will-help-blind-people-see-at-the-cinema_uk_5a1819d7e4b0d4906cae5225How Our New Technology Will Help Blind People ‘See’ At The CinemaSight loss affects around two million people in the UK, a number that is likely to increase to four million by 2050.

Losing sight can of course change many areas of a person’s life – even seemingly insignificant things like being able to watch a good film or a new programme on television. A recent survey of over 100 visually impaired people found that 34% hadn’t attended the cinema in the last 12 months. For sighted people this figure was found to be much lower at only six per cent.

A lot of this is down to the fact that going to the cinema when you are visually impaired can be challenging. Audio description (AD) is often relied on by blind and partially sighted people – this is like a narrator telling a story and explaining the visual content of the film. Around 40% of the cinemas in the UK now include AD services. But these aren’t always available for use, either because of faulty equipment, cinema staff not knowing how to operate it, or issues with the headphones required for AD interfering with hearing aids.

One visually impaired person I spoke to explained how every time she tried to attend her local cinema, staff were unable to operate the equipment or the equipment was faulty. The cinema would then give her free vouchers for another film at another time, but upon her return, the same thing would happen. She now has a collection of vouchers she cannot use

Frustrated film fans

The UK has been at the forefront of developments in AD and in 2003 the goverment’s Communications Act dictated that broadcasters had to ensure ten per cent of their programming had AD. The BBC, Channel 4, ITV and Sky committed to including AD in at least 20% of their content.

But although there has been an increase in AD on both broadcast and on-demand services, the latter is still lagging behind. This is in part why the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in partnership with MovieReading have developed an app designed to overcome some of these limitations. The app allows users to download an AD track for a programme or film, and this then synchronises automatically to the original content.2

Endings can often be bittersweet, none more so than those that remind us exactly what it is we’re going to be missing.

In the last days of life, before the planned NASA suicide mission, Cassini was afforded greater proximity to the planet than ever before.

Although this inevitably caused it to crash and burn after thirteen years of orbiting the planet, it was able to take a series of 42 new red, green and blue images.

The images cover the planet from one end to the other and feature the moons Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, Epimetheus, Mimas and Enceladus.

Although they were taken on 13 September (two days before the death plunge) image scientists have had to spend months assembling the images into a mosaic, to give us the entire picture.

And it’s made everyone at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory a little bit nostalgic about the spacecraft.

Elizabeth Turtle, imaging team associate, said: “It was all too easy to get used to receiving new images from the Saturn system on a daily basis, seeing new sights, watching things change.

“It was hard to say goodbye, but how lucky we were to be able to see it all through Cassini’s eyes!”

Launched in 1997, the Cassini spacecraft orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.

The mission made numerous dramatic discoveries, including the surprising geologic activity on Saturn’s moon Enceladus and liquid methane seas on Saturn’s largest moon, Titan.

Robert West, deputy imaging team leader, said: “Cassini’s scientific bounty has been truly spectacular ― a vast array of new results leading to new insights and surprises, from the tiniest of ring particles to the opening of new landscapes on Titan and Enceladus, to the deep interior of Saturn itself.”1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/24/us/crashing-plane-hits-firefighter-btc-beyond-the-call-of-duty/index.html'He went into a burning plane to save us'It was about 9:30 a.m. the Friday before last Fourth of July. Meffert was in Orange County, California, driving south on Interstate 405, one of America's busiest highways, ahead of a big getaway weekend.

With the John Wayne International Airport off to his right, Meffert kept driving as the twin engine Cessna continued its descent. Meanwhile, the pilot was radioing the airport tower. "297 mayday! We got mayday!" the pilot yelled to air traffic control. "I lost my right engine!"

Do you know an officer who has gone above and beyond what the job requires? E-mail us at BeyondtheCallofDuty@cnn.com.

"My second glimpse is, 'I think this plane's going to hit me,'" Meffert recalled. "And my third glimpse it is across the front of me, hitting me. All I see is maybe like a white flash."

The wing of the plane skidded across the front of Meffert's vehicle as the aircraft crashed onto the highway and burst into flames -- just feet from the airport's runway. Besides a small dent, the only other damage to Meffert's SUV was a scrape from the left headlight to the one on the right.

From first hit to first responder

But Meffert, who happens to be a captain with the Avalon Fire Department on Catalina Island, wasn't thinking about his car. He maintained control of his vehicle, backed up closer to the plane and pulled over to the side of the freeway. While he was concerned that the plane could blow up, he immediately started running toward it even though he wasn't sure anyone could have survived the crash. "I felt like I needed to go see if everyone was okay," Meffert remembered.

"It wasn't until I saw the passenger," he said. "Her head pops up on the passenger side just enough that I'm like, 'there's somebody alive.' So I ran even faster and then I came from the tail section of the plane toward the passenger front."

The woman was already outside trying to lift the pilot out through her door. He guided the woman toward the back of the plane where there wasn't any fire and went back for the pilot.

Frank Pisano's small plane crashed last summer on Interstate 405 in Santa Ana, California.

"His butt was on the passenger seat and his legs were on the pilot side," Meffert said. "I just came underneath his arms and said, 'I am going to get you out of the plane.' And I lifted him up and out."

He then dragged the pilot away from the plane and to the side of the highway to begin rendering aid.

Of all the people the plane could have hit, there are few better qualified to help in an emergency situation than Meffert. Before becoming a firefighter, he served seven years in the United States Navy. He was stationed in the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm, working in the intensive care unit on the hospital ship named Mercy.

After a tour in Japan, the 47 year old finished out his naval career in San Diego, working in acute care and emergency. With his years of experience, Meffert says he quickly switched into first responder mode, asking the couple questions to ascertain their injuries. "Both of them were pretty bloody," Meffert said. "I was really amazed that there weren't, like, more injuries to them."

'John was a hero'

Pilot Frank Pisano broke six bones in his back. His wife, Janan, broke five bones in hers; both are on the road to recovery. Frank has been flying for 27 years and had owned the aircraft involved in the accident for 10 years. He remembers opening his eyes right after the crash and seeing the wing on fire. He told his wife to get out of the plane. He, too, was afraid it was going to blow up. But his wife would not leave his side.

The crash created a traffic nightmare.

"He saved my life and my wife's life because I know she would have stayed trying to help me," Frank said. For the Pisanos, there's no doubt Meffert went beyond the call of duty. "John was a hero. He went into a burning plane to save us," Frank said.

In the minutes after the crash, several civilians stopped to offer help. In a video taken by one of the first people on the scene, there's a man who took off his shirt to wrap around Janan's bleeding head. A couple of nurses rendered first aid while other people tried to tame the fire until more first responders arrived. "People responded in such a way of giving a little bit of effort to try to stop something that was horrible," Meffert said.

Lucky to be alive

It's amazing that no one died. While a few vehicles drove into pieces of the plane on the highway, Meffert's was the only one hit by the crashing aircraft -- a fact made even more spectacular considering how busy the highway usually is, especially on a getaway weekend. Meffert knows how lucky they all are to be alive.

"I play all the 'what ifs' -- going slower, going faster -- it could have been a different turnout," Meffert said, getting emotional. "We just had a lot of angels. So I feel very blessed that I was safe and able to render care to them."2
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/ant-financials-alipay-bans-high-interest-loans.htmlAnt Financial's Alipay bans high-interest loans, as Chinese regulators eye online lendersAlibaba Group affiliate Ant Financial has banned consumer loans with annual interest rates above 24 percent from its Alipay platform, a move which comes as China's government increases scrutiny of lightly regulated online lending.

Ant Financial, which operates Alipay, confirmed to Reuters it has introduced the rule for business partners to better protect consumers.

It said it has recently stepped up inspection of financial product providers on Alipay and Sesame Credit, its credit platform, and found some problematic cases involving "interest rates above the legal limit and inappropriate collection methods."

Ant said it would continue to monitor and remove noncompliant businesses and asked all to conduct self checks by Nov. 30.

The move comes after the government this week took steps to tighten supervision of the lightly regulated sector of online lending, leading to companies scrapping plans to go into the business.

The government on Tuesday issued a notice asking provincial authorities to suspend regulatory approval for new internet micro loan companies and to restrict granting approvals for companies to conduct lending across regions.

Companies providing small loans, especially over the internet, have expanded rapidly in the past year in China, partly due to loose regulation.-1

"In the long run, looking at three to five years, if you are an investor, the fundamentals are so neutral and the stock is so low at this point that we would look at this as more of a value play," Chad Morganlander said Wednesday on a "Trading Nation" segment on CNBC's "Power Lunch."

"They don't have a lot of debt, so you want to look at this company and perhaps over the next three to five years," added the Washington Crossing Advisors portfolio manager. "You can get a better-than-market return with a little less volatility."

Under Armour's stock has plunged 55 percent this year, making it the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year. Despite losing half its value, Under Armour is still trading at a premium to its peers. The company currently has a multiple of 41 times earnings, compared rival Nike, which is actually up 16 percent this year and currently has a forward price-earnings ratio of 25.

Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, believes that Under Armour will actually succumb to competitors like Nike, and he pointed to the departure of its footwear chief on Tuesday as indicative of the company's operational problems.

"They really have to stabilize operations, they have to stabilize brand," he said on "Power Lunch." The executive's departure this week marks the company's fifth c-suite exit since October. "They may be facing very, very stiff competition from Nike from above, from Adidas from below, and possibly even Amazon coming into the sports apparel business, which would destroy them from the sidelines."

"I think it's a classic falling knife, palm wide open trap right now. If anything, it's a value trap," he said.

The move would come shortly after activist hedge fund Jana Partners took a 1.3 million share stake in Jack in the Box, the parent company of Qdoba, a chain of fast casual restaurants.

If a deal materializes, it would be another big score for Jana this year. The hedge fund earlier took a big stake in the grocery chain Whole Foods and pushed it to consider a sale.

http://time.com/money/5027711/black-friday-hours-2017-stock-market-post-office/?xid=homepageHere Is Everything Closed on Black Friday 2017Are banks open on Black Friday 2017? What about the post office and the stock market?

Thanksgiving Day is an official federal holiday. But the day after Thanksgiving — Friday, Nov. 24, also known as Black Friday — is not. Even so, virtually all schools are closed, many states recognize the day as a holiday, and many companies give workers Black Friday off as a vacation day.

So what’s open and what’s closed on Black Friday 2017? Here’s what you need to know.

Are banks open on Black Friday 2017?

The overwhelming majority of large banks are open for business as usual on Black Friday, with normal hours at bank branches across the country. Banks like Wells Fargo, Chase, and HSBC confirmed to MONEY that bank branches are open on Black Friday, and virtually all other major banks will be open with normal hours.

There are a few exceptions, however. They include some bank branch locations in areas that are closed to visitors on Black Friday. For example, if a bank branch is located on a college campus that is closed on Black Friday, the bank may be closed that day as well.

Some credit unions and small local banks may also be closed on Black Friday. For example, branches of North Carolina-based Welcome Federal Credit Union and Michigan’s Allegan Credit Union are closed on Black Friday. If you do your banking at a credit union or local bank, check to see if branches are open on Black Friday.

Is the post office open on Black Friday?

Post offices are generally closed on all federal holidays, including Columbus Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. But since Black Friday is not a federal holiday, post offices are open and mail is delivered like normal on Friday, Nov. 24.

Is the stock market open on Black Friday?

Yes, but hours are limited. The New York Stock Exchange is open on Black Friday, but markets close at 1 p.m. ET. Likewise, Nasdaq is closed on Thanksgiving and open on Black Friday with limited hours: The close is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 24.

Are any stores closed on Black Friday?

Black Friday is famous for being an epic day for shopping, so virtually all stores are open — most with extended holiday hours and new rounds of deals popping up around the clock.

One notable exception is REI. In recent years, as backlash arose around stores being open on Thanksgiving, the outdoors retailer made a point of remaining closed on Black Friday as well as Thanksgiving. As REI has in the past, it is encouraging people to skip the mall on Black Friday and instead enjoy the great outdoors in any manner under the sun, with its #OptOutside movement. Participants are asked to share pictures of their outdoor adventures on Instagram using that hashtag.0

http://cnn.com/2017/11/24/opinions/tax-code-change-opinion-sheffield/index.htmlHouse and Senate tax bills would be a step forwardCarrie Sheffield is the executive director of Generation Opportunity, a project of the grassroots advocacy group Americans for Prosperity , founded by Charles and David Koch and funded by conservative and libertarian donors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) When I was little, my family spent some time on public assistance. So I learned at a young age that the best way to lift people out of poverty and into the middle class is to expand economic opportunity. Creating well-paying jobs allows for the social mobility that is often unattainable for families when they are dependent on government assistance. People thrive with the dignity of self-reliance.

The US tax code works against this principle.

Instead of rewarding hard work and entrepreneurship, the tax code rewards lobbying and "rent-seeking ." Instead of instilling a sense of fair play, it is justifiably viewed by tens of millions of Americans as rigged against them. This has led to a majority of citizens favoring major changes to tax laws

The tax code is built upon bad fiscal policy, which is, needless to say, bad for the nation. We have to find a better way to operate.

On Thursday, the House passed a tax reform bill, and the Senate has advanced its own tax proposal, both of which would be a big step toward remedying some of these ills.

In different ways, the House and Senate bills would cut back on the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT). This provision has generated some strong pushback, but let's consider what this means for a minute.

The deduction for state and local taxes is an advantage for a subset of a subset. According to 2014 data, only about 30% of taxpayers, generally wealthier ones, itemize their deductions. And even for that minority the SALT deduction's value is uneven, since residents of high-tax states like California and New York get a bigger deduction on their federal taxes than those living in low-tax states. This effectively means high tax states are taking a larger cut from the federal government than low-tax states.

How is it fair that residents of low-tax states are left subsidizing the bad choices made by lawmakers in other states? Why should two people with similar incomes and similar life situations who live perhaps miles apart near a state line be treated so differently?

The answer, of course, is politics.

At roughly 4 million words , the tax code is all but undecipherable. According to the Small Business Administration, many small business owners who do their own taxes spend more than 40 hours every year preparing and filing their federal tax returns.

Many small businesses hire somebody to do it, another cost burden. The National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent organization within the IRS, found that complying with the code costs American taxpayers $195 billion a year. Small businesses alone spend between $15 and $16 billion a year on compliance costs, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.

Talk about immoral. That's time parents could be spending with their kids. That's money small business owners could be investing in their stores, their employees, their futures.

Then there's the unfairness of it.

Big businesses have even bigger challenges, but they can afford to hire lawyers and accountants to navigate the tax code (and lobbyists to help get legislation written in their favor). The tax code is a treasure trove of subsidies, handouts and breaks for those well-connected enough to get them. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that tax expenditures, including preferential tax rates, credits, special exclusions, exemptions, and deductions, will exceed $1.5 trillion this year alone.

What we're left with is a two-tiered system in which some are the movers and shakers, and the rest of us are just left shaking with rage at the injustice of it all.

Will either the Senate or House tax reform measures fix all these problems? Of course not. What legislation ever solved a problem completely? Deals are cut, compromises are necessary, politics continues to be played.

But both bills include provisions that constitute an improvement over the status quo.

Lower rates on individuals mean more money in the pockets of taxpayers, and corporate rate cuts benefit everybody. These reforms should not be viewed as "tax cuts for the rich." Instead, they are tax cuts that enrich us all.

Join us on Twitter and Facebook

These bills aren't perfect. But lawmakers are making progress toward overhauling a system defined by this sorry sentiment: 72% of Americans polled on Election Day 2016 said "the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful."

Bitter partisanship should not preclude Washington from doing the right thing and fixing the unfairness that permeates the tax code. It's time to move away from a convoluted and arcane system that discourages economic growth and baffles most of us, toward a simpler, fairer system that creates opportunity for all.0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/24/entertainment/james-cameron-titanic-review/index.htmlJames Cameron's 'Titanic' special misses the boat(CNN) There's a great special to be made about "Titanic," the movie; and Titanic, the giant ocean liner that sunk 105 years ago. "Titanic :20 Years Later With James Cameron" splashes down somewhere between the two, and in the process almost completely misses the boat.

Produced by Cameron, and coinciding with an anniversary re-release of the film and a related book, the special focuses on the veracity of the movie, and how well its conclusions have held up as new revelations about the ship and its sinking have arisen in the years since the film.

The result, though, is a pretty wonky look at the science of all that, including experiments and reenactments designed to illustrate precisely how the ship went down, or how long it would have taken for a man with a knife to cut lifeboats loose.

It's moderately interesting, in the way almost everything about the Titanic is, beginning with oceanographer Bob Ballard, who discovered the wreck more than 30 years ago while on a secret mission for the U.S. Navy. And Cameron's passion for and knowledge of the subject obviously shines through.

The special also seeks to incorporate a more human element, with Cameron interviewing descendants of passengers who either survived or perished aboard the ship, including relatives of John Jacob Astor, Molly Brown, and Isidor and Ida Straus. It's a promising idea, but mostly plays like an excuse to have these family members pat the director on the back for how moving they found the film to be.

http://time.com/money/5036418/black-friday-2017-online-deals-40-off-everything-code/?xid=homepage21 Stores Where Black Friday Means 40% to 50% Off Everything OnlineAt long last, Black Friday 2017 is here. In fact, major retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and Toys R Us opened their doors and launched big Black Friday sales sometime yesterday.

While hardcore shoppers are turning up in droves at America’s malls to experience the excitement of Black Friday in person, it’s easy enough to scoop up Black Friday deals from the comfort of your own home. The vast majority of deals are available to online shoppers browsing on laptops, tablets, or iPhones, and in terms of bargains and selection, the Black Friday online deals are arguably better even than what shoppers find in stores.

What’s particularly intriguing at Black Friday is that year after year the day is increasingly growing more similar to Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday was created as the online equivalent of Black Friday, yet as the online Black Friday deals keep expanding, it’s clear that Black Friday 2017 is not just a day for “going shopping” in the traditional, physical sense.

What’s more, in the same way that Cyber Monday deals tend to feature broad, across-the-board discounts on everything e-retailers sell, the websites of major retailers like Gap, Old Navy, J. Crew, Abercrombie & Fitch, Eddie Bauer, Lands’ End, and Express are offering 40% off site-wide for Black Friday 2017. Many throw in free shipping on all Black Friday orders too.

We’ve rounded up a list of over 20 such clothing-heavy stores below, which boast the simplest Black Friday deals possible for shoppers.

Police eventually said that they had stood down their response.

The police force said they had received reports that shots had been fired on Oxford Street and in the nearby underground station, which they were responding to as if it might be terrorist-related.

They later said there was no evidence that shots were fired, or that there were any casualties. The station has since been reopened.

"Police were called at 16:38 hrs ... to a number of reports of shots fired on Oxford Street and underground at Oxford Circus tube station," the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

"Police have responded as if the incident is terrorist related. Armed and unarmed officers are on scene" the police added.

The police have not yet located any suspects.

"If you are on Oxford Street go into a building. Officers are on scene and dealing," London's Metropolitan Police said on Twitter.

The Reuters witness said Oxford Street had been packed with shoppers taking advantage of the Black Friday sales. The witness said the area had been cleared of people and traffic and fire engines and police were rushing to the scene.

"Oxford Circus Station is closed while we investigate a customer incident," said the capital's transport operator, Transport for London, adding trains were not stopping at the station due to the incident.0

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/sexual-harassment-isnt-just-about-men-says-female-ceo-commentary.htmlSexual harassment isn’t just about men. Women should review their behavior too, says this female CEOIt's easy to say "Of course not" to my own query of whether I could be guilty of wrongdoing on this scale. The answer to many questions is no: Have I ever dated, attempted to embark in any physical relationship, made sexual explicit comments, or suggested any improper activity with a person at my company? No. Does that let me off the hook? I don't know.

I have winked at men, and at women, after making a point that I thought was amusing or irreverent. Is that wrong? I have lunched and dined with my partners, clients, attorney, and business associates for decades without any more incident than sometimes fighting over a check. I buy Scratch tickets for male colleagues' birthdays. Is that provocative? I sure hope not.

Even if I cannot identify anything in my work history about which someone has ever taken offense, I should not take my clean slate for granted in the future. Power positions have conferred entitlement, including sexual, in the workplace. Therefore, anyone with the power, male or female, can somehow forget that sexual authority over a subordinate is not a professional perk.

Two days ago, I gave a hug to one of my male partners as I left for the airport in San Francisco and he was staying on for more meetings. Was that inappropriate? Not in my book, but the book is being rewritten and I want to stay current with the new edition.

A few years ago, I learned that the rules had changed for good on interactions between the sexes. The headmaster of the high school for which I served as chairman of the board told the students that if they wanted a hug along with their diploma, a common and longstanding tradition at commencement, they should give him a specific hand signal. Otherwise he would only shake their hand. He was following new guidelines on physical contact with students, and hugs were verboten, although graduation was an exception. About half the women and a quarter of the young men gave him the signal.

If misuse of power is the dominant enabling force in sexual misconduct, anyone at a high level within an organization might cause harm, unintentionally, to a subordinate. The risks of ignoring this subject can be very painful in human terms, expensive to your business, extremely disruptive, and wildly time consuming. Insurance premiums, for policies that cover legal cases or settlements, are, unsurprisingly, skyrocketing.

Women in executive positions should not think of themselves as immune to bad behavior or less likely to face serious charges and repercussions if they act inappropriately. Because many of us have been the victims, we should be leaders in solving this workplace problem, both by standing up to our abusers and by setting examples for model behavior as corporate leaders.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/bitcoin-is-working-well-for-some-big-ticket-purchases-despite-its-volatility.htmlBitcoin is working well for some big-ticket purchases despite its volatilityEven as some of the world's most influential investors denounce bitcoin, the digital currency has steadily moved from the "dark web" into the real world and demonstrated where it may be most practical: big payments.

CNBC spoke with individuals and businesses who have paid or received thousands of dollars in bitcoin in recent weeks. They said the digital currency lets them complete transactions far more swiftly than by traditional, government-backed means.

Mark Hanna, an associate at family law firm Hanna & Vlahakis in New York, took bitcoin instead of dollars in payment after a client walked into his office wearing a bitcoin T-shirt. Because Hanna didn't have to wait for the check to clear, he said he could help his client that day.

"I already owned some," Hanna said. "It's just sort of a handy way to transfer money, really. It's faster than a check."

An October letter from the law office to the client posted on Reddit shows Hanna was paid $5,085 in bitcoin. Hanna said they transferred bitcoin directly using the Mycelium app, and he created a separate wallet just for the law firm, whose partners are his parents.

If it's "worth something in 10 years, then it's worth something. If not, then we did that service for free," he said.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses encryption technology to allow parties to send money quickly, securely and semi-anonymously. Users are identified only by a mix of numbers and letters, or an "address." Bitcoin also doesn't require a third-party institution and isn't tied to a government as currencies such as the U.S. dollar are.

However, bitcoin has struggled to gain widespread adoption as a currency for daily transactions, including international money transfers.

Bernstein Senior Research Analyst Lisa D. Ellis concluded in a Nov. 10 report that ordinary consumer payment systems are so efficient that bitcoin doesn't add much benefit. Ellis' test also found that cross-border bitcoin transactions, with a roughly 4 percent payment cost, were nearly 10 times more expensive than fintech start-up TransferWise's 0.5 percent. Using the digital currency was also slightly slower than TransferWise.

Instead, bitcoin has become the focus of investor speculation as its price has multiplied more than eight times this year to $8,000. The world's largest futures exchange, CME, plans to launch bitcoin futures in December, a move enthusiasts say will attract even more buyers.

But bitcoin has worked out as a practical form of payment for Montessori Schools in New York's Flatiron and SoHo districts. The schools don't accept credit cards, which can be costly and slow, for tuition payments.

This school year, the private schools began accepting bitcoin instead.

Bitcoin has been "actually really easy" to use, said Marco Ciocca, co-founder and chairman of the two Manhattan schools. He predicts more parents — and possibly even more schools — will embrace the technology.

But unlike bitcoin investors, who have watched their holdings multiply over the years, the schools immediately convert the digital currency to cash using an option available through Coinbase.

"I don't want to speculate on the bitcoin with the school's funds," Ciocca said. "We convert it instantly so we mitigate any issues."

As other industries arrive at similar conclusions about using bitcoin, or at least embrace the novelty of it, sellers of other big-ticket items are announcing they accept the cryptocurrency. Some art galleries, real estate purveyors and even yacht sellers are increasingly enthusiastic about taking bitcoin.

The owners of 18th-century palace Palacio Bardaji in Ibiza, Spain, will only accept bitcoin in payment "because of its easiness of use," a representative said in an emailed statement. The roughly 9,000-square-foot palace is going for 1,850 bitcoin, about $14.8 million at Friday's record high or $10.2 million at bitcoin's lows against the dollar last Sunday.

The online currency's remarkable ascendance — from a near-worthless entity in 2009 to a financial product that's gained Wall Street's attention — has bifurcated the bitcoin world into naysayers and true believers.

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, called bitcoin in October an "index of money laundering." Critics also say the price surge has resulted in mania-like behavior. For example, a family in the Netherlands is selling much of what they own for bitcoin and living on a campsite while they wait for the digital currency to take off.

Some enthusiasts, like entrepreneur Peter Saddington, want to "prove to people that you can actually transact with bitcoin."

When Saddington began researching bitcoin in 2011, he soon decided the digital currency would probably bring about the next big change in the way the internet affects society. That November, Saddington said he bought his first bitcoins at $2.52 apiece.

He said that investment paid off so handsomely that by 2017, his $115 worth of bitcoins from 2011 had appreciated enough for him to buy a Lamborghini Huracan — the Lamborghini's "entry-level" supercar that retails for about $200,000, according to Car and Driver.

Saddington said he specifically wanted to challenge online criticism about how using bitcoin to buy almost always results in a loss for the buyer. For example, a man in Florida experimented with bitcoin purchases in 2010 by offering 10,000 coins in exchange for two pizzas. Those bitcoins today are now worth tens of millions of dollars.

"There's always been this meme that you never buy a Lamborghini with bitcoin, because it's going to end up being a $20 million lambo," Saddington said. He has no regrets about spending his bitcoin on a car. "It's been great."1

"If I was Bob I would be looking at [buying 21st Century Fox] because the crown jewel for the moment at the U.S. would be Hulu. If he can get approved control of Hulu, it gives him a jumpstart on a direct consumer entertainment product," Malone said.

Disney and 21st Century Fox are already investors in Hulu, an on-demand subscription video platform primarily for television shows.

Disney said in August it plans to remove all its movies from Netflix and launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019.

A deal with Fox would also give Disney access to the European market through Fox's Sky brand, and the Asian market through Star, Malone pointed out.

21st Century Fox has been holding talks to sell most of the company to Disney, leaving only an entity focused on news and sports, CNBC reported last week, citing sources familiar with the situation.

Malone is widely respected as one of the most astute deal makers in the media and cable industries. He built and ran his cable empire TCI from the 1970s and sold it to AT&T in 1999 for roughly $50 billion. The investor has a net worth of nearly $8 billion, according to Forbes.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/15/chinas-climbing-bond-yields-raises-new-concerns-for-markets.htmlChina's climbing bond yields raise new concerns for marketsAdd Chinese bond yields to the list of indicators investors need to keep an eye on.

In the summer of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 — the worst start to a year for U.S. stocks — investors were glued to the daily fix of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar. The markets' worry was weakness in the yuan meant growth in the world's second largest economy was decelerating too quickly, out of Beijing's control.

Now some analysts are watching the rise in China's 10-year sovereign bond yield as an indication that growth may slow and spill over to global markets.

The yield topped 4 percent Tuesday Beijing time for the first time since October 2014. Overnight, the yield traded just shy of the three-year high of 4.033 percent.

Of two potential consequences for global markets, "the more worrisome potential outcome would be, the tightening of financial conditions in China would act as a financial market catalyst for a reversal in sentiment," said Benjamin Mandel, a global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York.

Markets would "act independent of what's happening in China's economy," he said.

Chinese 10-year government bond yield (2014 -2017)

The other worry is that China's economy actually does slow more than expected. This week's reports on retail sales and industrial production both disappointed economists.

China's economic growth remains robust at more than 6.5 percent, but 2016 marked its slowest in 26 years. Beijing is in the middle of a years-long process of shifting its economy from dependence on manufacturing to one focused on being driven by consumption. But the country has been reluctant to curb its dependence on borrowing to fuel growth.

The International Monetary Fund pointed out in its Global Financial Stability Report in October that Chinese banking sector assets are now 310 percent of GDP, up from 240 percent at the end of 2012 and nearly three times the emerging market average.

"Authorities face a delicate balance between tightening financial sector policies and slowing economic growth," the IMF said in the report.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a lengthy, high-profile speech last month at the 19th National Communist Party Congress that the country will focus on reforms and higher-quality growth.

"A big part of this reform process entails curbing credit growth through a variety of tools, one of which is rates, to help mitigate the risks of a hard landing scenario in the years to come. We see a tightening of monetary policy as a precondition for rebalancing, which could be expected at the cost of further slowing growth," Jose Wynne, portfolio manager on the Man GLG Emerging Markets Debt Team, said in an email to CNBC. As a result, he said the yuan could weaken or China's demand for commodities may slow down.

"We may see moments in 2018 where understandable market anxiety around growth decelerations may take over the market narrative, particularly in EM," Wynne said.

Government bond yields in other countries are also rising. Investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch earlier this month cited a bond market crash as one of their top worries. Yields rise when prices fall.

Mandel also attributed part of the latest rise in Chinese yields to some investors being caught temporarily on the wrong side of the trade. Those investors had bought Chinese bonds in anticipation that economic growth would slow, but financial conditions would loosen.

Since authorities have emphasized deleveraging, markets now expect tighter monetary policy, sending yields higher and forcing some investors to unwind their market positions, Mandel said. He expects the Chinese government bond yield will rise beyond 4 percent in the long term.

However, Mandel, Wynne and most other market analysts expect China's economic growth will remain steady, and that policymakers will implement any reform gradually.

Morgan Stanley analysts also published a report Monday explaining "why we are still bullish on China."

"We are more confident that China will be able to achieve a near-stabilization of its debt to GDP by [the second half of 2019] and will attain high-income status by 2025, two years earlier than we initially expected," the report said.-1

Especially when said item is your four-year-old child’s favourite teddy bear. This is what happened to Donna Cuthbertson and her daughter Summer, who were travelling home to Orkney from Edinburgh airport on Monday 20 November, when they misplaced the treasured toy.

When they got home Cuthbertson posted a plea on Facebook explaining that Summer removed Teddy from her bag as they were going through security and then forgot to put him back. Luckily for the Scottish family, the social media post caught the attention of some Loganair cabin crew prepared to go above and beyond for Summer. Air steward Kirsty Walter orchestrated the rescue mission, along with the help of pilot Russell Wheatley who flew the 200 miles to Kirkwall arrivals in Orkney.

But they didn’t stop there, they decided they would give him some TLC (teddy loving care) along the way. Teddy was given his own seat, a set of pilot wings to wear, and even a complimentary Tunnock’s caramel wafer. He also got a private visit to the cockpit to meet the rest of the onboard staff and take a selfie.

Cuthbertson said of Walter’s efforts: “She’s a credit to your company. If you do an employee of the month she definitely should win! “Summer has a friend for life now.” Of course Summer was “delighted to be reunited with her beloved Teddy” and donned an adorable tartan dress for the moment.

Lots of people have said they are impressed with the level of commitment the staff had shown to their young customer.

I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!”

Time’s person of the year award is not meant to be an endorsement but to recognise “the most powerful individuals and forces shaping the world—for better or for worse”. Previous winners include Hitler, Stalin and Vladimir Putin. This seemed lost on Trump last year, when he won and called it a “great honour”. Time hit back at Trump’s claim he was “probably” going to win again, saying he was “incorrect” about how the choice was made

The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6. — TIME (@TIME) November 25, 2017

Time’s Ex-managing editor Richard Stengel said: “Hate to tell you but that PROBABLY means you’re NOT Person of the Year. They just wanted a photo shoot.”

In June, The Washington Post reported that several of Trump’s clubs display what appears to be a cover from a 2009 issue of Time with Trump himself on the front. The image, however, is a fake; no such issue of the magazine exists. Trump was mocked by Andy Murray, who isn’t among the president’s regular critics. The tennis player adapted the president’s tweet to make it about the BBC’s Sports Personality Of The Year.

Murray isn’t known for tweeting about politics or telling jokes, so the humour was lost on some.

“All Donald Trump’s election showed me was that there’s literally nothing in my background that disqualifies me from running,” Roem, who this month became Virginia’s first openly transgender elected official, told the U.K.’s Channel 4 in an interview published Thursday. “When you brag about sexually assaulting women and then you get elected anyway, there’s no barrier to entry anymore.”

“So I said, there’s nothing in my background even close to that, so yeah. Go run,” Roem continued. “What are they going to hit me on — my gender? OK, they did.”

Roem, a Democrat, won Virginia’s 13th District House of Delegates seat on Nov. 7, toppling Robert Marshall, a 13-year incumbent who described himself as Virginia’s “chief homophobe.”

“You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait,” he’s heard saying in the audio clip. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”

Ultimately, she said, it was her constituents and supporters — like a 10-year-old trans girl who said she had contemplated suicide but was inspired by Roem’s story — who acted as the “jet fuel I needed to get through it.”-1

For the better part of 2017, she’s been a private citizen.

But certain media outlets aren’t making it easy for her.

After two stories about the 19-year-old’s personal life appeared in tabloid and conservative media, voices from both ends of the political spectrum called for giving the young Obama her privacy.

“Malia Obama should be allowed the same privacy as her school aged peers,” Ivanka Trump tweeted on Friday. “She is a young adult and private citizen, and should be OFF limits.”

Malia Obama should be allowed the same privacy as her school aged peers. She is a young adult and private citizen, and should be OFF limits. — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) November 24, 2017

Chelsea Clinton, a persistent advocate for privacy when it comes to kids living in the White House, chimed in shortly afterward.

“Malia Obama’s private life, as a young woman, a college student, a private citizen, should not be your clickbait,” she wrote. “Be better.”

Since President Donald Trump’s family moved into the White House, Clinton has also been moved to call out media outlets that focus attention on Barron Trump, who is 11 years old.

Leaked video published by the conservative site The Daily Caller and other outlets appeared to show Malia Obama smoking. Another video, published by TMZ along with still photos, showed her kissing someone during a tailgate party for the annual Harvard-Yale football game.

Tabloids claim to have identified the young man as a student at Harvard, where Obama has just begun her freshman year after taking time off following high school. She has expressed interest in pursuing a career in the film industry.

Noticing that Obama’s name was trending due to the gossip headlines, people on social media reacted with pointed jokes about the media’s choices and sober criticisms ― but mainly jokes.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/julie-bishop/in-times-of-crisis-we-must-work-especially-hard-to-protect-women-and-girls_a_23286895/In Times Of Crisis We Must Work Especially Hard To Protect Women And GirlsOctober 11, 2017: Nur Kayida, 20, is seen with her two-day-old baby with no given name at a makeshift camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.

In conflicts and crises across the world, women and girls can suffer terrible abuses. The UN estimates that seven in 10 women are exposed to violence in crises. The risk of abuse increases when they flee without the family or community networks that would normally support them, leaving them vulnerable to trafficking or assault.

The trauma of such experiences cannot be overstated, severely affecting mental and physical health. Many victims suffer long-term trauma and struggle to return to a normal life.

In October, Shakila* left Rakhine State in Myanmar after she was raped and her family was killed. She fled to Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh where she has received medical assistance and counselling for the sexual violence and trauma she experienced.

Shakila is just one of more than 620,000 Rohingya who have escaped violence in Rakhine State since August, 2017.

This mass exodus of civilians brings with it horrifying tales of large-scale sexual violence against women and girls. A significant percentage of those who have fled Myanmar report having experienced or witnessed sexual violence in Rakhine State and remain vulnerable to violence and exploitation once they reach Bangladesh.

In Cox's Bazar, around 33,000 Rohingya women and girls have sought assistance for sexual or physical violence since August 25. Over the next five months, almost 450,000 women and girls are expected to need help.

During times of crisis we must work especially hard to protect women and girls when they are at their most vulnerable.

To help meet the needs of those who have fled to Bangladesh, Australia has provided $30 million in assistance, including $1.5 million to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) -- an agency focused on preventing and responding to sexual violence against women and girls. Our assistance is supporting the provision of critical medical and counselling services, including establishing 35 safe places where thousands of women and girls can access support services.

The Australian Government is also supporting a joint appeal with leading humanitarian agencies to assist Rohingya who have fled violence in Myanmar, including women and girls. We are matching donations to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the Australian Red Cross on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to a total of $5 million.

In Cox's Bazar, UNHCR is working to protect vulnerable people from further harm. This includes making sure new camps are set up as securely as possible, for example by installing lighting and ensuring easy access to toilets during the night for women and children. UNHCR is also providing shelter to more than 250,000 people, which is helping to reduce the risks for women of sleeping in the open.

The high level of sexual violence experienced by Rohingya women and girls is not unique. This is why protecting women and girls is one of Australia's priorities in responding to humanitarian crises.

In Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria, Australia is supporting the provision of essential services to women and girls who have survived sexual and physical violence. These localised projects have a significant impact on the lives of those needing help.

Since 2016, Australia's work in Afghanistan has supported nearly 1,700 female survivors of violence to receive counselling and 800 women to access shelters to escape violence in their homes.

We must all make it clear that violence against women and girls anywhere and at any time is not acceptable. During times of crisis we must work especially hard to protect women and girls when they are at their most vulnerable.

One thing teachers learn early on in their careers is that no child is alike. Each is an amalgam of different traits, preferences and behaviours.

As a parent of three, it still surprises me to see how different the children are to each other, despite their shared genetics. They eat differently, sleep differently, tantrum differently and cuddle differently.

Despite the differences between children, whether in a classroom or at home, many have one thing in common: their love of humour. This is nowhere more evident than in their choice of books. Whether it is the sarcasm, the silliness, the dry humour or the boldness; some of Australia's most popular books for children, particularly those of school age, are those which are funny.

Publishers and comedians have been quick to pick up on the popularity of humour for school-aged children. The silly, outlandish hijinks of Andy Griffith and Terry Denton have made the Treehouse series by far Australia's most popular books for the age group in recent years, selling in their thousands.

Then there are Aaron Blabey's Bad Guys books, noted by Readings booksellers for their "bold humour and eye-popping, mischievous artwork", while the antics of the class clown in 'Funny Kid for President' has seen the series take up a position in Australia's bestseller lists.

For a time, humour, silliness, sarcasm and wackiness are some of the chief elements that children are looking for in the books they read, and that is something to celebrate.

It is not just writers who are getting in on the act, but comedians are also increasingly claiming space on bestseller lists. Anh Do's 'Spooky Weird! Weirdo: Book 9' was one of Australia's bestselling books for children this month, while his picture book, 'What Do They Do With All the Poo from all of the Animals at the Zoo?' was a winner in my household, each reading was accompanied by chuckles from my kids.

Further afield, the combination of sarcasm and awkwardness of the Wimpy Kid and the Roald Dahl-esque humour of comedian David Walliams have attracted huge audiences around the world.

This month, Books & Publishing reported that children had voted for their favourite books in state-based 'children's choice' awards. Among the winners were books by comedians Andy Lee and Anh Do, alongside Blabey and Griffiths.

And the list of the books most commonly borrowed from Australian libraries by children up until the age of 12 is illuminating.

'The 65 Storey Treehouse' (Andy Griffiths, illustrated by Terry Denton).

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever' (Jeff Kinney).

'The 39 Storey Treehouse'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck'

'The 26 Storey Treehouse'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'

'The 52 Storey Treehouse'

'The 13 Storey Treehouse'

The existence of humorous books for children might not be entirely new, but their dominance seems to be. I rarely remember reading a funny book as a child, more interested in the earnest Famous Five and the Babysitters Club series, in the poignant 'The Great Gilly Hopkins'and the tragic 'Bridge to Terabithia'.

However, Roald Dahl was an earlier writer who had a keen eye for children's humour, well-loved for his offbeat and non-pc take on childhood. He joked about the smelly and fat, drunken and ugly, and often cast a critical eye on the adults surrounding his young protagonists. More recently, Walliams' bestselling style of writing has been compared with Dahl's, not least because both partnered with illustrator Quentin Blake.

Growing up, I remember that Dahl was one of my brother's favourite writers. While my brother did not particularly like to read, he was drawn to humour in books, choosing to read 'Elmer Runs Wild'and 'The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole'. I wonder whether, had the number of funny books that exists now been available to him at the time, he would have found reading to be more enticing.

Interestingly, the attraction, or perhaps availability, of funny books falls once readers reach their teenage years, books with more emotional or adventurous themes take over. According to Books and Publishing, the most borrowed books by young adults (aged between 13 and 18) included John Green's tearjerkers 'The Fault in our Stars' and 'Paper Towns', two Harry Potter books and a few science-fiction novels.

And, of course, it is not just funny books that children like to read. 'Mr Huff' was recently awarded the Children's Book Council of Australia's Early Childhood 'Book of the Year' award. The story is slow and deliberate, a dark cloud following the main character throughout. It is a serious book, with a heaviness at its heart, despite the lightness of its ending. Yet, children adore it, listening over and over.

They also love the rhythm of Mem Fox's picture books and the fear and apprehension of 'Where the Wild Things Are' and 'The Gruffalo'.

Like adults, children's tastes in books are varied and complex. However, for a time, humour, silliness, sarcasm and wackiness are some of the chief elements that children are looking for in the books they read, and that is something to celebrate.

While their concerns might broaden and their curiosity about the world around them might send them in a different direction as they get older, it is the simple, satisfying joy of laughter that is leading them to books.

Here Are 6 ReasonsYou've just eaten a large, nutritious dinner and sit down to watch TV, but you're still hungry for something sweet or salty. Really, we should feel full, but our cravings get the best of us and an entire block of chocolate disappears.

There are many reasons we can feel hungry even when we've eaten, from high stress levels to lack of sleep, and it's important to try to identify our triggers in order to stay happy and healthy.

To understand the reasons why we constantly feel hungry or snack endlessly -- as well as find strategies to curb emotional eating and regulate appetite -- HuffPost Australia spoke to Libby Weaver, aka Dr Libby, a leading nutritional biochemist, bestselling author and international speaker.

Reasons you're always hungry

1. You actually need food

"The first reason is you have a physical need for food," Weaver told HuffPost Australia. "One of the things that signals hunger is when our blood glucose levels start to decrease, so there can of course be a physical reason for hunger."

To discern whether you're physically hungry, look for these tell-tale signs: notice if the hunger comes on slowly (emotional hunger tends to come on quickly), listen for stomach growls, and test if you're still hungry after drinking a big glass of water.

"In that moment ask yourself, 'if I am actually hungry, would I go back and have some more vegetables?' If the answer is 'no', you're probably not hungry."

Solution: eat regular, nutritious meals and snacks throughout the day, and don't skip breakfast.

"And eat more dietary fat from whole food sources, which can make a big difference to what we experience in the evening," Weaver said.

Healthy sources of fat include avocado, nuts, seeds, oily fish and chia seeds.

2. You're feeling bored, sad or alone

"Number two would be the many different emotional reasons for hunger," Weaver said.

"If it's sweet food someone wants when they're not really hungry, I'll often use the analogy that they're looking for sweetness in life -- they're looking for joy, for something to look forward to.

"Some people continue to eat after dinner, telling themselves they're hungry, but they are actually trying to numb emotional pain.

"The phrase I tend to use in situations where you feel like you want food, but you know you can't actually be hungry, is: it's never about the food -- it's the way we distance ourselves from the way things are when they're not how we want them to be. It's very difficult in those moments when you really feel like a packet of biscuits to realise this."

If you're not hungry for a bowl of veggies, you're probably not hungry at all.

Solution: keep a 'what do I really want?' journal.

One strategy Weaver recommends is to keep a notebook to understand why you're experiencing an emotional food craving. To set up the journal, draw four columns: title the first column 'what do I really want?', which is where you write what you're craving. For example, biscuits.

The second column is 'what do you really, really want?'. While your brain may still say 'biscuits' to begin with, if you keep pushing "you realise you might want company, or a hug, or a 'thank you' for washing up every night for the last 18 years".

"The third column is how you perceive having this want -- whether it's the hug, company or 'thank you' -- would make you feel.You might feel appreciated, loved," Weaver said.

"That's actually what you're looking for the food to make you feel, but food can never do that. Food can never tell you that you're appreciated."

The fourth column is 'how do I experience that emotion in a way that's not harmful to my health?'.

"It might be that your children are in bed so you go and watch your children sleep. Or you've got a dear friend who really understands you and you phone her. Or you write in a diary, or exercise, or watch the sunset because it reminds you everything is always okay in the end."

Identifying the core of your food cravings can help you better manage them.

3. You're stressed

Stress is another big cause for always feeling hungry or constant snacking.

"What I mean by that is our stress hormone production: adrenaline and cortisol," Weaver said.

"Science suggests humans have been on the planet for about 150,000 years, and for all of that time adrenaline has communicated to the body that our life is in danger.

"In modern times, we make adrenaline when we consume caffeine and from our perception of pressure and urgency, and the body has not yet learned to decipher the difference between the adrenaline we make from a genuine threat to our life, and the adrenaline we make when we've got six new deadlines on our desk. To your body it's all the same thing."

When our bodies are producing more stress hormones and we have high circulating levels of adrenaline, we require a 'fuel' to power us out of the danger the body thinks it's in. And this affects hunger cues.

"The only two fuels for the body are glucose or fat -- we typically use a combination of both. But when you've got adrenaline you need a fast-burning fuel to get you out of danger," Weaver said.

"The body will get the message to burn glucose -- that is, sugar. Because of the stress response, you will then crave sweet foods to try to top up the stores you've been burning all day."

Stress eating is definitely a thing.

Solution: practise deep breathing and reduce caffeine intake.

"There's a part of the nervous system that adrenaline drives -- the sympathetic nervous system, which is the fight-or-flight response. Instead of activating that we want to activate the other arm of the nervous system -- the calming arm, which is the parasympathetic nervous system," Weaver explained.

"The only thing science currently knows that will do this is to extend the length of our exhalations. Do a breath-focused practice when you first wake up -- whether it's meditation, tai chi, yoga, pilates or breath awareness."

Alternately, implement moments of 20 long, slow breaths across the day, such as every time you wait at the red traffic lights, make herbal tea or every hour at the computer.

"Get a ritual in your day," Weaver said. "We also have to be honest about how much caffeine we're having and really explore our perception of pressure and urgency."

Practise deep breathing while waiting at the lights.

4. Your food lacks colour, variety and flavour

Humans eat first with their eyes, so if you're used to bland-coloured foods like burgers, chips and biscuits, this lack of colour and variety (and thus lack of sensory sanctification) could be why you're experiencing constant hunger.

"There are definitely people who continue to feel hungry because of a lack of sensory pleasure. If they've had a meal which is really bland, they're going to continue to feel hungry because their senses weren't stimulated," Weaver said.

Solution: eat mindfully and add various colours, flavours and textures to your meals.

"These people do well with really flavoursome foods, lots of herbs and spices, and a variety of colours."

5. You're not sleeping enough

"Sleep has an enormous impact on our appetite. Originally researchers thought that the extra hunger people felt from a lack of sleep was really in search of energy because they were fatigued," Weaver explained.

"What we now understand is that when people don't get enough sleep, the two main hormones that regulate satiety and appetite (leptin and ghrelin) change. You are biochemically driven to want to eat more food when you haven't had enough sleep."

Solution: make sure you're getting eight hours of sleep per night and have a regular bedtime and waking time.

Avoid screen time for at least one hour before bed.

6. You've set up a habit

Another reason we may feel constant hunger, particularly after a filling dinner, is simply habits we have formed over time.

"People do get into real habits of eating dinner and having dessert. Try to recognise when a habit no longer serves your health in any way, and really that's just about making a decision," Weaver said.

Solution: make healthy swaps and eat more dietary fat.

"If you can't stop eating a dessert, it would be wise to make homemade healthy desserts and keep them in the freezer ready to go for the week, so the dessert you have after dinner is a nourishing choice," Weaver said.

"You can make the desserts higher in fat as fat is very satiating, and subtly sweetened with dates, to start to change your habits."

Updated

The story of a 16-year-old girl who in 2004 killed a man who picked her up for sex is spreading around the world, after a number of high-profile celebrities joined a campaign to free her.

Cyntoia Brown was sentenced to life in prison over the killing of 43-year-old Nashville real estate agent Johnny Allen.

Allen picked her up off the street after she was forced into sex work by her boyfriend, a pimp who went by the name "Kutthroat" and serially abused her, the BBC reported.

Brown said after he picked her up, Allen took her to his house and showed her his gun collection, telling her he used to be an army sharpshooter.

She said when the pair got into bed, "he grabbed me in between my legs — he just grabbed it real hard … I'm thinking he's going to hit me or do something like it".

Allen then turned over in the bed, and Brown said she panicked, thinking he was reaching for a gun.

Thinking she was about to die, she shot him in the head with a .40-calibre gun that Kutthroat had given her.

Brown was arrested for murder and tried as an adult. She pleaded self-defence. The jury found her guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree felony murder, and aggravated robbery.

She will not be eligible for parole until she is 67.

#FreeCyntoiaBrown

Brown's case has gone viral on social media after singer Rihanna posted about it on Instagram.

"Imagine at the age of 16 being sex-trafficked," she wrote to her 58.2 million followers.

"Did we somehow change the definition of #JUSTICE along the way?? Cause … Something is horribly wrong when the system enables these rapists and the victim is thrown away for life!"

Supermodel Cara Delevingne shared the post to her 40 millions Instagram followers.

Kim Kardashian West also tweeted to her 57.2 million following about the case, saying "the system has failed".

"It's heartbreaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life!

"I've called my attorneys yesterday to see what can be done to fix this."

Brown has since earned her Associate's Degree from Lipscomb University while in prison and is currently working towards her Bachelor's Degree.

She is also reportedly working side-by-side with the courts and the Juvenile Justice system as an unpaid consultant.

Assistant District Attorney Jeff Burks, the man who jailed Brown, said being young and likeable should not exonerate her.

"She wasn't just somebody who made one mistake," he said, according to the BBC.

"She was a very dangerous person. The choices she made were hers. She's pretty and smart and articulate so people have decided to take up her cause. Let's not forget her crime."

Every dog is the greatest in their owner's eyes, but it seems those of us living in NSW have a favourite breed -- The Labrador Retriever.

According to an analysis of dog registrations on the NSW Companion Animals Register for 2016-17, there are 114,088 registered Labradors living in the state.

The golden, black or chocolate brown fur balls are renowned for their loveable temperaments and are one of the easiest dogs to train, making them a great addition to the family.

Coming in second place is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier with 112,292 listed on the Register. The Jack Russell Terrier came in third with 90,610 registrations.

The online register was launched in 2016 and provides pet owners and breeders with opportunity to store and update contact details, as well as pay lifetime dog registration fees. Registering your pet online also increases the chances for you to be reunited with your furry friend if they go missing.

The analysis of the register also revealed the most dog obsessed LGAs in the state. The Central Coast was the clear winner, with 117,458 dogs recorded in the area.

One thing teachers learn early on in their careers is that no child is alike. Each is an amalgam of different traits, preferences and behaviours.

As a parent of three, it still surprises me to see how different the children are to each other, despite their shared genetics. They eat differently, sleep differently, tantrum differently and cuddle differently.

Despite the differences between children, whether in a classroom or at home, many have one thing in common: their love of humour. This is nowhere more evident than in their choice of books. Whether it is the sarcasm, the silliness, the dry humour or the boldness; some of Australia's most popular books for children, particularly those of school age, are those which are funny.

Publishers and comedians have been quick to pick up on the popularity of humour for school-aged children. The silly, outlandish hijinks of Andy Griffith and Terry Denton have made the Treehouse series by far Australia's most popular books for the age group in recent years, selling in their thousands.

Then there are Aaron Blabey's Bad Guys books, noted by Readings booksellers for their "bold humour and eye-popping, mischievous artwork", while the antics of the class clown in 'Funny Kid for President' has seen the series take up a position in Australia's bestseller lists.

For a time, humour, silliness, sarcasm and wackiness are some of the chief elements that children are looking for in the books they read, and that is something to celebrate.

It is not just writers who are getting in on the act, but comedians are also increasingly claiming space on bestseller lists. Anh Do's 'Spooky Weird! Weirdo: Book 9' was one of Australia's bestselling books for children this month, while his picture book, 'What Do They Do With All the Poo from all of the Animals at the Zoo?' was a winner in my household, each reading was accompanied by chuckles from my kids.

Further afield, the combination of sarcasm and awkwardness of the Wimpy Kid and the Roald Dahl-esque humour of comedian David Walliams have attracted huge audiences around the world.

This month, Books & Publishing reported that children had voted for their favourite books in state-based 'children's choice' awards. Among the winners were books by comedians Andy Lee and Anh Do, alongside Blabey and Griffiths.

And the list of the books most commonly borrowed from Australian libraries by children up until the age of 12 is illuminating.

'The 65 Storey Treehouse' (Andy Griffiths, illustrated by Terry Denton).

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever' (Jeff Kinney).

'The 39 Storey Treehouse'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Old School'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck'

'The 26 Storey Treehouse'

'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'

'The 52 Storey Treehouse'

'The 13 Storey Treehouse'

The existence of humorous books for children might not be entirely new, but their dominance seems to be. I rarely remember reading a funny book as a child, more interested in the earnest Famous Five and the Babysitters Club series, in the poignant 'The Great Gilly Hopkins'and the tragic 'Bridge to Terabithia'.

However, Roald Dahl was an earlier writer who had a keen eye for children's humour, well-loved for his offbeat and non-pc take on childhood. He joked about the smelly and fat, drunken and ugly, and often cast a critical eye on the adults surrounding his young protagonists. More recently, Walliams' bestselling style of writing has been compared with Dahl's, not least because both partnered with illustrator Quentin Blake.

Growing up, I remember that Dahl was one of my brother's favourite writers. While my brother did not particularly like to read, he was drawn to humour in books, choosing to read 'Elmer Runs Wild'and 'The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole'. I wonder whether, had the number of funny books that exists now been available to him at the time, he would have found reading to be more enticing.

Interestingly, the attraction, or perhaps availability, of funny books falls once readers reach their teenage years, books with more emotional or adventurous themes take over. According to Books and Publishing, the most borrowed books by young adults (aged between 13 and 18) included John Green's tearjerkers 'The Fault in our Stars' and 'Paper Towns', two Harry Potter books and a few science-fiction novels.

And, of course, it is not just funny books that children like to read. 'Mr Huff' was recently awarded the Children's Book Council of Australia's Early Childhood 'Book of the Year' award. The story is slow and deliberate, a dark cloud following the main character throughout. It is a serious book, with a heaviness at its heart, despite the lightness of its ending. Yet, children adore it, listening over and over.

They also love the rhythm of Mem Fox's picture books and the fear and apprehension of 'Where the Wild Things Are' and 'The Gruffalo'.

Like adults, children's tastes in books are varied and complex. However, for a time, humour, silliness, sarcasm and wackiness are some of the chief elements that children are looking for in the books they read, and that is something to celebrate.

While their concerns might broaden and their curiosity about the world around them might send them in a different direction as they get older, it is the simple, satisfying joy of laughter that is leading them to books.

Both sides of the Australian Government have condemned the terrorist attack that killed more than 230 people at a mosque in Egypt's North Sinai.

Militants detonated a bomb during Friday prayers and gunned down worshippers as they tried to escape.

Both Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop offered their condolences to the families of the victims of the "appalling and barbaric" attack.

"We send our condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery for the injured," Mr Turnbull wrote on Twitter.

"We are resolute in our determination to defeat Islamist terrorism & keep Australians safe."

Egyptian authorities have advised the Australian Embassy in Cairo that no Australians are known to have been killed or injured in the attack.

Friday's attack is the deadliest in the country's modern history and is the latest in a series of deadly attacks on places of worship across Egypt – mainly aimed at Christian Copt worshippers and churches in Cairo, Alexandria and Tanta.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong have also condemned the attack

"Labor stands once more with all people of goodwill, of all faiths who utterly reject those who would seek to divide us through terror and violence," they said in a joint statement.

"An attack on any place of religion is an attack on freedom of religion everywhere and Labor expresses our support and deepest sympathy for the victims, their families, and the Egyptian people."

Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has vowed to respond with "the utmost force".

The Australian Government continues to advise Australians to avoid North Sinai due to a high terrorist threat. Egyptian security forces have been fighting a militant group associated with Islamic State in the region since 2013.-1

The annual day for focusing on the prevention of the disrespect and abuse of women around the country, which is now in its 14th year and also falls on the International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women, is this year championing its theme of 'STOP' to highlight the need for action on the matter.

CEO of White Ribbon Australia Libby Davies told HuffPost Australia that "it's up to every single one of us to drive change together" when it comes to violence against women and men play a major role in that.

"White ribbon's particular work focuses on engaging men to be part of the change that has been brought to the forefront of our attention by women over many decades. Now we are continuing to see the silence being broken," she said.

"This year [White Ribbon's campaign focuses on]... becoming a much more active bystander -- what can you do in your everyday life to become part of this social change movement? Your actions are important in helping to stop violence."

White Ribbon Australia's 'STOP Kit' This year's theme aimed at the prevention of violence against women is centred on the acronym STOP -- See, Talk, Offer Support, Prevention. SEE -- "Abusive and disrespectful behaviour can be witnessed in your community, amongst your friends or within your family. It could be someone yelling at a woman on the street or physically pushing someone around."



It's about learning the signs, being a witness and not ignoring the situation.

The most important part of stopping violence against women is thinking about your own behaviours, educating yourself and changing any negative attitudes.

Davies also said that, while women in Australia are becoming more confident in reporting abuse and violent attitudes are seemingly changing, White Ribbon Day represents a year-round effort to stop disrespect towards females and that needs to continue.

"Women are now feeling more comfortable and supported to report the violence that for years and years was behind closed doors and about which they were silent. So now, we are seeing an increase in violence against women because women are calling it out for what it is," she said.

"What we have seen is that there is a change in attitudes for the better which will eventually influence the behavioural change that we're seeking... It will take a long time before the real impact of this prevention work is felt but we are seeing the signs already and that's very encouraging."

Violence against women and children is currently a serious problem in Australia. One women dies every week around the country at the hands of a current or former partner, one in three have been a victim of physical or sexual violence since the age of 15 by someone known to them and one in four have been emotionally abused by a partner.

According to Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins, part of the problem stems from everyday Australians believing that they would not be responsible for such violence themselves, but are unaware of their attitudes that could contribute to abuse continuing.

"What we know is that the prevention of violence against women is connected to achieving gender equality and better attitudes towards women more broadly," she told HuffPost Australia.

"While most people would say that they would not themselves perpetrate violence, actually in our society there are a lot of violence-supportive attitudes that are the attitudes that allow it to occur and let it go to continue, which has got us to this point."

Domestic violence isn't just between adults – it's often witnessed and experienced by children too. That's why the National Plan to Reduce Violence is about women and their children.

She also said that it's now important to realise that Australians need to "Stop It At The Start" -- which is the Federal government's national primary prevention campaign -- by educating children about disrespectful behaviours that they may have been conditioned into believing.

"What the campaign is doing is looking at that and peeling it right back to how children are conditioned from a very young age to... accept that disrespecting girls is just part of the condition of growing up and adulthood," she said.

"The campaign is really targeting influencers -- so parents, grandparents, teachers, coaches -- and getting them to think about the examples such as 'boys will be boys' or 'takes two to tango'.

"These are the kid versions of excusing or justifying making grisly accountable for what happens to them as well."

Violence against women is not always physical & these types can take a profound and long-term toll on women and children's health and wellbeing, on families and communities, and society as a whole.

And while she said she believes there is still more work to be done in Australia on the issue of violence against women, Jenkins said that there are simple steps everyday individuals can take to help stop abuse.

"Across Australia, violence against women is recognised as one of the key priorities that needs to change," she said.

"I think we are at a moment where both government, corporates and community sectors are really focusing on what they can do to change that but there are still women every day who are at risk of serious injury, so we haven't turned the corner in thinking that this is a safe place for our women and girls.

"We know that if you think it's safe, speaking up in the moment is helpful because it sends a message that that's not appropriate and that you might not feel that it is safe.. but the really most important place to go, because these issues are really quite sensitive, is to call 1800 RESPECT.

"If there is a dangerous situation at the time, absolutely call the police. The great thing about the heightened awareness of these issues is that police are now so much more sophisticated and responsive to these issues."

If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au. In an emergency, call 000.-1

Included in this total is about 200 rounds that Paddock fired from his Mandalay Bay hotel room into the hallway, injuring hotel security guard Jesus Campos, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Wednesday.

He spent decades amassing a vast weapons arsenal, although more than 30 of his firearms were purchased in the 12 months preceding the shooting.

Fifty-eight people, plus Paddock, were killed in the shooting.

Authorities also found about 4,000 rounds of unused ammunition in the hotel room, Lombardo said. He said that officials have yet to determine a motive.

"I'm frustrated," Lombardo said, adding that the city's police department is still working with the FBI to process the ballistics evidence.

Hundreds of victims have filed lawsuits in the wake of the shooting, claiming negligence on the part of MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, and Live Nation, the group that organised the festival during which the shooting occurred.-2

For the better part of 2017, she’s been a private citizen.

But certain media outlets aren’t making it easy for her.

After two stories about the 19-year-old’s personal life appeared in tabloid and conservative media, voices from both ends of the political spectrum called for giving the young Obama her privacy.

“Malia Obama should be allowed the same privacy as her school aged peers,” Ivanka Trump tweeted on Friday. “She is a young adult and private citizen, and should be OFF limits.”

Chelsea Clinton, a persistent advocate for privacy when it comes to kids living in the White House, chimed in shortly afterward.

“Malia Obama’s private life, as a young woman, a college student, a private citizen, should not be your clickbait,” she wrote. “Be better.”

Since President Donald Trump’s family moved into the White House, Clinton has also been moved to call out media outlets that focus attention on Barron Trump, who is 11 years old.

Leaked video published by the conservative site The Daily Caller and other outlets appeared to show Malia Obama smoking. Another video, published by TMZ along with still photos, showed her kissing someone during a tailgate party for the annual Harvard-Yale football game.

Tabloids claim to have identified the young man as a student at Harvard, where Obama has just begun her freshman year after taking time off following high school. She has expressed interest in pursuing a career in the film industry.

Noticing that Obama’s name was trending due to the gossip headlines, people on social media reacted with pointed jokes about the media’s choices and sober criticisms ― but mainly jokes.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/24/news/cfpb-richard-cordray-resignation/index.htmlRichard Cordray resigns as head of Consumer Financial Protection BureauRichard Cordray sent a letter to President Trump on Friday, declaring that he's officially done leading the federal government's controversial consumer watchdog agency once the clock strikes midnight.

In a separate letter to his staff, Cordray, who is the first-ever director of the fledgling Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, announced that chief of staff Leandra English will serve as the bureau's acting director.

The move comes just over a week after Cordray said he planned to leave his post at the end of November. That announcement sparked speculation about whether Trump would install a member of his administration to lead the bureau.

A source told CNN Trump is likely to name Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney as its acting director.

Related: Richard Cordray to step down as head of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

Mulvaney, like many Republicans, has been a staunch critic of the CFPB. While serving in Congress, he voted in favor of killing the agency. He and other opponents argue the agency -- which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to keep an eye on Wall Street -- has too much power and installs unduly harsh regulations.

Mulvaney has worked alongside Trump to roll back some of the rules they have pinned as anti-business. And some Republicans have called for Cordray to be fired -- a move that would have proved troublesome for Trump since law forbids him from firing the CFPB director without cause.

The CFPB's proponents, however, say the agency plays a key role in preventing big business from preying on the little guy.

In his exit letter, Cordray said the CFPB's work is "vital" to the U.S. economy.

Related: Trump likely to tap budget director Mulvaney as interim CFPB chief

"We have returned almost $12 billion to more than 30 million consumers who had been cheated or mistreated by banks or other large financial companies," he wrote.

Cordray was appointed by President Obama and first assumed his post in 2012. His decision to leave may have less to do with political tension and more to do with a desire to run for governor of Ohio in 2018.

But his departure marks an opening for Trump to embark on a major overhaul of the agency.

They can’t focus on their work, they’re distracted, and they have trouble staying on top of everyday responsibilties. They become easily frustrated, stressed, and anxious, and often lose confidence in their ability to get tasks done. This can lead to a very reduced quality of life. Fortunately, there are great treatments available to help control these symptoms, including medications, talk therapy, and executive function coaching, which helps patients learn better organizational and planning skills. The most effective medications for adult ADHD are called stimulants, and while they can truly change a patient’s life, finding the right one can sometimes be a challenge. I make sure my patients monitor their symptoms closely and look out for certain signs that they need to try a different drug.

Manafort also took 19 trips over a 20 month-period after February 2014 while working for the pro-Russian Ukrainian Opposition Bloc party, according to the documents.

The night before Thanksgiving is long-considered one of the busiest bar nights of the year.

State and local police are out in full force too, making sure drivers make it home safely.

Police in Burton want to make sure folks celebrate responsibly, and thanks to federal grant money, they have dedicated patrols for Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights.

"Everyone's home," said Morgan Rombach, a senior at SVSU, "first chance to see everyone in a long time."

She's celebrating being at home for the holiday with her friends from high school, but she's doing so responsibly with a designated driver.

"What will he get to drink tonight," we inquired. "Probably water," Rombach replied.

"Not worth going out on the road unless you have someone who can drive," said Josh Lazenby.

Lazenby is celebrating his 26th birthday at the bar, and he's also got a designated driver.

"So what are you drinking tonight," we asked his friend Kristopher Hoffa, "Sprite, Shirley Temples," he said.

A smart strategy according to Sergeant Tom Bade with the Burton Police Department.

"Either have somebody step up to be the designated driver, or kick in some money for an Uber driver or a taxi, it's not that hard and a lot of people make them available on night's like this," said Sgt. Bade.

Sgt. Bade is hitting the streets this Thanksgiving Eve, looking out for drunk drivers.

"Trouble staying in their lane, sitting at green lights, that kind of thing," he explains when asked what he looks for from other drivers.

"Unfortunately for a lot of people, they get stopped because they're not drunk driving, but they're texting and driving," Bade said, "it has a lot of the exact same effects."

A driver pulled over for driving without tail lights on his trailer Wednesday evening, gets off with a warning

"No lights whatsoever, but this guy's got good driving record," said Bade. "No issues, just going to this house right there, we'll let him slide."

But for those heading out for the evening Sgt. Bade hopes they have a plan to get home safely.

Veteran bar tender Patricia Lay plays a role in that.

"A lot of people that come here are regulars so we kind of know," she said, "that they'll have Ubers or Lyfts or one of their friends is driving. I do see a lot of people come in with friends that drink water or coke all night."

"You have to be aware of how much you're serving - don't over serve," she said.

Lay says she has no problem cutting someone off.

Sgt. Bade says it will get busy on the roads shortly before closing. His advice? Leave the bar early.0
http://www.3newsnow.com/news/local-news/omaha-fbi-warns-shoppers-about-credit-card-fraudOmaha FBI warns shoppers about credit card fraudOMAHA, Neb. (KMTV) - Federal authorities are taking credit card and other fraud so seriously this holiday season, they rolled out their top man to warn local shoppers.

As throngs of people head to the malls and big box stores for Thanksgiving and Black Friday deals, Special Agent In-Charge Randy Thysse said there are three specific things you can do to protect yourself. Number one, do not let a clerk or worker leave your sight with your card. Agent Thysse said, "That reduces your chances of being skimmed. The bad guys are going to take your card. They'll swipe it once legitimately to make the transaction go through but often they have a pocket skimmer where they can run it through to get that information off your magnetic strip. "

Number two, try to avoid using a debit card in which you have to punch in a pin number. Agent Thysse says this will lower your risk of somebody seeing your personal number.

Number three, use a credit card with a chip instead of one you have to swipe. There is an algorithm, embedded in the card with a chip, that makes it very difficult to reproduce or steal the electronic information.

If you are shopping on line, cyber thieves are lurking. Agent Thysse says there is one thing you should never do.

http://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/doctors-nurses-at-cleveland-va-hospital-help-grant-veteran-s-final-wish-to-ride-carouselDoctors, nurses at Cleveland VA hospital help grant veteran's final wish to ride carouselCLEVELAND - One Northeast Ohio family wanted to give thanks to the doctors and nurses at the Veteran’s Medical Center in Cleveland on this Thanksgiving for helping them grant a dying veteran’s final wish.

Billy Rose, 68, was admitted for the last time on October 16th, battling pancreatic cancer.

Right across the street from the VA hospital, in the Western Reserve Historical Society, sits the old carousel from Euclid Beach Park, which Rose had ridden as a child. All he wanted, his family said, was to get well enough to ride it once again.

So when they got the news that he needed to be transferred from the ICU to hospice care, the family asked doctors and nurses if they could help grant his wish before the move.

In less than half an hour, Billy was bundled up and wheeled across the street, with doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and oxygen tanks right beside him.

“I think it meant the world to him. I think it did. To me, that was his last wish,” said his wife of 49 years, Bernadette Rose.

The Western Reserve Historical Society granted the family use of the carousel for as long as they wanted.

“The joy in his face, he didn’t even have to say anything,” said daughter Michelle Rose. “I’m thankful my father had that little bit of joy the last moments of his life, before he went to die. So I’m very thankful to the ICU unit, and to the Western Reserve for what they did for him. And there’s nothing we can do that is enough to pay them back for what they gave to my father.”

A spokesperson for the Cleveland VA sent News 5 the following:

“We are honored each and every day to care for our nation’s heroes, especially in their time of need. Our dedicated staff goes above and beyond to provide kind and compassionate care for our Veterans and their families. Often we hear stories of staff working with Veterans, their families and the community to fulfill a Veteran’s last wishes, doing whatever we can to honor their service and sacrifice with our deepest gratitude.”

Billy Ray Rose passed away November 4 and was laid to rest at the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery for veterans in Rittman.2
http://www.kptv.com/story/36910483/multnomah-county-gives-homeless-families-a-home-for-the-holidaysMultnomah County gives homeless families a 'Home for the Holiday - KPTV - FOX 12While many will spend this holiday weekend at home with family, there are thousands of people in the Portland metro area who have no home to celebrate in.



A local initiative called “Home for the Holidays” is trying to change that for some, by giving 40 homeless families a home for the holidays and giving them an opportunity to get back on their feet.



Wednesday was the first time Andrea Bunch and her son have had a place of their own to live in over four months. She's been homeless since July and was staying at the Human Solutions Shelter, one of Multnomah County's primary family shelters.



Bunch and her son saw her new home today for the first time.



“It was surprising. I wasn't expecting the playground,” she said. “He hasn't really stayed in any place where there's a playground.”



The folks from Eco Living stocked the fridge with food.



“They are going to eat well tonight in a place of their own, by the warmth of a new fireplace, so that's a wonderful place for them to be,” Human Solutions Executive Director Andy Miller said.



The family also received a gift card for groceries.



“There is nothing that warms my heart and makes us feel like we're doing our job than watching families have the opportunity to move into their next home,” Miller said.



This is just the beginning of a new life for Bunch and her son. Over these next four months in her new place, Bunch has one goal.



“Get a job, so that way I can keep it, keep staying here, so I can have a stable place for my son,” she said.



Bunch and her son will be able to stay in this apartment for four months and then move to permanent housing.



Portland city officials are looking for more landlords willing to lend a hand to house these homeless families this winter. For more information, go to ahomeforeveryone.net.

http://time.com/money/5026187/small-business-saturday-2017-gifts/?xid=homepage10 Super Cool Gifts to Buy Online on Small Business SaturdayAlthough mass-marketed Black Friday deals tend to hog all of the attention, you should really make note of the great gifts on sale for Small Business Saturday 2017.

You might be wondering, just what is Small Business Saturday, anyway? Small Business Saturday was actually first conceived in 2010 by credit card company American Express to help mom-and-pop retailers on Main Streets across the country get a bigger share of Americans’ holiday shopping purchases.

Small Business Saturday is always the Saturday after Thanksgiving and the day after Black Friday. This year, that is November 25. There are plenty of reasons why you should shop at small businesses. Supporting small businesses boosts local economies, and you can often find more unique and original gifts when you seek out small producers. But if the idea of getting out and searching for that perfect gift at a maker’s fair or a local Main Street is too much to contemplate after battling the crowds at the big-box stores, we have the goods for you — literally. You’re not going to find this stuff at the mall.

Here are 10 great Small Business Saturday gifts you can score without leaving the comfort of your living room. They are all made or marketed by small, independently-owned businesses, who sell their merchandise on sites like Etsy and Uncommon Goods.

There are people who love technology, and then there are people who grudgingly accept it as a necessary evil of 21st-century life. For the latter, this sleek leather-and-wood iPhone case should make them feel a tiny bit better about their concessions to modernity.

Fidget spinners were cute while they lasted, but we never quite bought into the idea that an adult could fiddle with one and not look silly. This gorgeous, three-dimensional brass puzzle, though, has enough literal and figurative heft to be a grown-up desk accessory as well as an engaging plaything.

There are Big Genius discoveries like E=MC², then there are small-g genius lightbulb moments. For every woman who’s surreptitiously pulled a forgotten elastic band off her wrist at a formal function, this cuff bracelet with a groove to fit a ponytail holder is one of those breakthroughs.

http://time.com/money/5017282/jeff-bezos-net-worth-2017-100-billion/?xid=homepageJeff Bezos Net Worth 2017: Amazon CEO Is Worth $100 BillionJeff Bezos, the founder and principal shareholder of Amazon, has become the first person in the 21st century with a net worth over $100 billion thanks to a Black Friday boost to Amazon’s stocks.

Bezos’ wealth reached $100.3 billion on Black Friday, according to Bloomberg. The $2.4 billion increase from Bezos’ previous mark of $97.9 billion makes Bezos the second to reach the $100 billion milestone since Bill Gates in 1999.

Bezos briefly overtook Gates in October to become the world’s richest man after a spectacular year that saw his net worth climb from around $60 billion to over $100 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index.

Bezos, whose mother gave birth to him when she was a teenager, came from a tough background to found Amazon in 1994. The company started life as a bookseller but quickly grew to become what Bezos affectionately calls “the everything store,” surviving the burst of the dot-com bubble and expanding across the globe.

Amazon has seen its most impressive growth, however, in the last three years. At the end of 2014, its stock price was hovering around $300. It is now the fourth largest company in the United States.

In June, Amazon announced it bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The company plans to use the acquisition to expand Amazon into groceries, one of the last lucrative area of retail it has yet to fully conquer.

Bezos is also seeing promising advancements in his dream to fund humanity’s first outpost on Mars. His space company, Blue Origin, last year launched its first reusable rocket. Bezos has said in the past that humanity’s future is not on Earth.

On Nov. 6, Bezos sold one million shares in Amazon with its stock at a record high, netting himself a cool $1.1 billion in cash. He maintains a 16.4% stake in the online shopping giant, according to Bloomberg.

New statistics released this month by the Institute for Policy Studies revealed America’s three richest men — Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and investment magnate Warren Buffett — have the same amount of wealth as the poorest 160 million people in the U.S.

The same report found that America’s 25 richest people together hold over $1 trillion dollars, the same wealth as 56% of the U.S. population.0
http://time.com/money/5012509/dream-job-10000-month-cancun-vacation/?xid=homepageDream Job Alert: Get Paid $10,000 a Month to Vacation in CancunCalling all travel enthusiasts: This is your opportunity to sleep in luxury hotels, hang out on the shores of Cancun, scale Mayan ruins and mingle with locals in the hottest clubs, while getting paid for the privilege.

Cancun.com—a tourism website promoting the Mexican resort city—just launched a campaign to find its next Cancun Experience Officer. The, ahem, “CEO” will act as the face of Cancun.com for at least six months, traversing the city’s beaches, urban destinations and natural wonders—and telling the world all about it. Adventures will include swimming with a 40,000-pound whale shark, teeing off at an ocean fairway, climbing 3,000-year-old pyramids, and getting VIP table service at nightclubs.

The role would require you to post videos, blogs and social media posts about your (hopefully amazing) experiences around Cancun.

The gig pays $10,000 per month, the job posting says—while Cancun.com also provides you with all-inclusive hotel stays and paid-for excursions. The company will also give you video and photo equipment to capture your experiences with appropriate detail (and enthusiasm).

The position is open for either one person or a team of social media savvy brand ambassadors (although the pay doesn’t increase for multiple people). You should be able to craft stories and engage online audiences, immerse yourself in charitable projects with local organizations, and withstand the physical demands of extensive travel, the posting says.

Though you’ll need to have a knack for posting on social media, having a huge online following isn’t a requirement. “It doesn’t have to be somebody who has a million followers on Instagram,” Cancun.com general manager Chad Meyerson tells MONEY. “It can be somebody who is just very passionate about the destination and wants to go out there and document what it has to offer.”

To apply, candidates should submit a 60-second video describing why they (or their crew) would make the ideal Cancun Experience Officer; deadline is December 17. Candidates must be over 18 years old, have a valid passport, and be able to live in Cancun for the entire six-month duration. (Also note that the U.S. State Department currently has a travel advisory for Cancun’s state, Quintana Roo.)

Meyerson says the five leading candidates will fly to Cancun to take part in an “Interview Event,” which includes formal interviews, team building exercises and physical assessments. Cancun.com will announce the appointment of the CEO at a live event on January 31, 2018.

“I think that this form of finding a candidate to fill this role should be a lot of fun,” Meyerson said. “We really want to open this up to everybody, we want people to have interesting takes and personalities to come and see if they can add value here.”

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/25/momentum-grows-for-another-grand-coalition-in-germany.htmlMomentum grows for another grand coalition in GermanyMembers of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) will likely approve a renewed coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives if party leaders present a convincing proposal, a member of the party's executive leadership said on Saturday.

Niels Annen of the SPD, in an interview with the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper, called for quick action to form a new German government given a range of crises around the world, and said a "grand coalition" was an option that could not be excluded.

SPD leader Martin Schulz on Friday agreed to hold talks with Merkel about reviving their outgoing coalition government, but said no decisions had been made and party members would have the final say on any deal.

But he suggested that governing could help the SPD achieve its political aims and told the party's youth wing - which rejected another grand coalition at a party conference - that he expected their loyalty and "constructive cooperation."

Annen said the SPD needed to hear from "the failed chancellor" about how she envisioned the future government before agreeing to another four-year tie-up with conservatives.

The center-left SPD had vowed to go into opposition after suffering its worst result in 70 years in September's election, but came under intense pressure, including by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to rethink its position and help avert a disruptive repeat poll in Europe's largest economy.

Schulz said party leaders agreed to talks out of a sense of responsibility to Germany and Europe after Merkel's attempt to form a government with two smaller parties collapsed on Sunday.

"Germany urgently needs a predictable and reliable government. A grand coalition could be an option and we should not exclude it," Annen told the newspaper, adding that the SPD was focused on "what is good for the country."

He welcomed plans to take any coalition agreement to members for a vote, and said the party should continue its restructuring efforts after the September election setback.

"I'm certain, if the SPD leadership makes a convincing proposal, it will be able to convince the membership," he said.

Annen cited citizens' insurance and better protection for renters as issues to hash out with conservatives.

SPD deputy leader Ralf Stegner told the Funke newspaper group that Schulz would retain his leadership role, saying he continued to enjoy strong support within the party.

"There is absolutely no doubt that Martin Schulz will be re-elected as party chairman with a good result," he said.0

Adobe Insights, which measures 80 percent of online transactions at 100 major U.S. retailers, said mobile transactions are "hitting record highs" this holiday season.

"The big story this holiday season is in mobile shopping," Mickey Mericle, the vice president of Adobe's Marketing and Customer Insights division, said.

"Shoppers looking for discounts are getting better at using smartphones to quickly close the deal, and we are seeing better mobile conversion this season at over 10 percent growth."

As of 10 a.m. ET on Black Friday, Adobe said 61.1 percent of shoppers' visits to retailers' websites stemmed from mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. Those devices were driving 46.2 percent of total online revenue, as consumers had already spent more than $640 million by Friday morning. That's an increase of 18.4 percent compared with a year ago.0

“Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photoshoot,” Trump said in the tweet. “I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!”

But in a tweet from TIME Friday night, the company said, "The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year," and that the recipient will not be announced until Dec. 6.

Trump was awarded the title last year after he won the 2016 presidential election.

The magazine’s managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, said last year that the choice of Trump was “straightforward.”

In 2015, Trump made the short-list for the award but it was instead offered to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At the time, Trump said in a tweet that he had predicted he wouldn’t win and referred to Merkel as the “person who is ruining Germany.”

TIME recently defined its “Person of the Year” as “a person (or people) who has had the most influence over the news in the last 12 months.”

While the magazine’s editors make the final choice, they reportedly take into consideration the opinions of their readers and let them vote, TIME said.

According to their posted results as of Friday night, Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, was leading the pack, followed by Trump, “The Dreamers” and “#MeToo.”0

France has called for an “uncompromising” dialog with Iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Iran has repeatedly said its missile program is defensive and not negotiable.

“If we have kept the range of our missiles to 2,000 kilometers, it’s not due to lack of technology. ... We are following a strategic doctrine,” Brigadier General Hossein Salami said, according to Fars.

“So far we have felt that Europe is not a threat, so we did not increase the range of our missiles. But if Europe wants to turn into a threat, we will increase the range of our missiles,” he added.

The head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards military force, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said last month that Iran’s 2,000-kilometer missile range could cover “most of American interest and forces” within the region, so Iran did not need to extend it.

Jafari said the ballistic missile range was based on the limits set by the country’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the head of armed forces.

Iran has one of the Middle East’s largest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike Israel.

“POLITICAL AND SPIRITUAL” SUPPORT

The United States accused Iran this month of supplying Yemen’s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the United Nations to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with missiles and weapons.

“Yemen is in total blockade. How could we have given them any missile?” Salami said, according to the Fars report on Saturday. “If Iran can send a missile to Yemen, it shows the incapability of (the Saudi coalition). But we have not given them missiles.”

Salami said the Houthis managed to increase the range and precision of their missiles in a “scientific breakthrough.”

Jafari, the head of the Revolutionary Guards, said on Thursday that Iran only provides “advisory and spiritual” assistances to the Houthis.

Iran long denied sending fighters to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad in the fight against the rebels, and said the Revolutionary Guards’ presence on the ground was advisory

In what seemed to be a correction of Jafari’s comments, Salami said on Saturday that Iran’s support for the Houthis was “political and spiritual.”

The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

The United States says Iran’s missile program is a breach of international law because the missiles could carry nuclear warheads in the future.

Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is for civilian uses only.-2

Due to the “egregious” nature of the accusations against Rose, The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University issued a statement Friday revoking its Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism, which was bestowed on the host in 2015.

“This unprecedented action is taken with the utmost seriousness and deliberation. We are not in the business of trying to rewrite history,” the school’s dean, Christopher Callahan, said in a statement.

Although Callahan acknowledged that the gesture is “largely symbolic,” he hopes it sends a message that Rose’s reported behavior was “unacceptable.”

“The actions victimized young women much like those who make up the overwhelming majority of Cronkite students ― young women who deserve to enter workplaces that reward them for their hard work, intelligence and creativity and where they do not have to fear for their safety or dignity,” he said.

The second institution, the University of Kansas’ William Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Communications, also issued a statement on Friday to take back the National Citation it presented Rose earlier this year.

“William Allen White was an important journalist who also felt that it was important to make a positive difference in the community,” Dean Ann Brill said in a statement.

Rose hosted a longtime talk show on PBS and co-anchored “CBS This Morning” until reports of misbehavior began surfacing earlier this month as part of the #MeToo movement, which encourages men and women to share stories of sexual abuse.

The host stands accused of sexual misconduct by around a dozen women ― some of whom worked with him professionally. They say Rose made unwanted advances that included groping and walking in front of them naked.

In response, both CBS and PBS cut ties with the host last week.

Rose’s former “CBS This Morning” co-hosts Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell have spoken out about their former colleague’s behavior.

“This is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and more generally the safety of women,” O’Donnell said last week. “Let me be very clear: There is no excuse for this alleged behavior. It is systematic and pervasive.”

King added that she was shocked by the allegations.

“What do you say, when someone that you deeply care about has done something that’s so horrible? How do you wrap your brain around that? I’m deeply rocked by this.”

In his response to the accusations, Rose “deeply apologized” in a statement.-1

The streets were peaceful; most residents of the city were asleep or at home listening to the news. Maldonado took out his smartphone and starting recording a video of himself.

“Here we are on [Avenue] 23,” he laughed, leaning against a street sign. “El año que se murió la yegua.”

This last sentence is a little awkward to translate; literally it means “the year the mare died.” Yegua, or “mare”, is a fairly strong insult in Spanish, which is to say it’s not the type of thing the average politically-conscious Cuban would be calling the recently-deceased Comandante during a time of official national mourning.

“El año que se murió la yegua!” Maldonado repeated, to uncomfortable looks from passersby. He was jubilant, yet disappointed at the tepid reaction to the president’s death. “Unfortunately,” he told me later, “The number of people I would have liked to see shouting ‘freedom!’ in the streets didn’t turn out.” As he passed by the Hotel Tryp Habana Libre, Maldonado had a sudden inspiration.

The building, one of the tallest and most prominent in the Havana skyline, has an unusual history. It was originally the Havana Hilton; after Fidel Castro’s triumphant entry into Havana in 1959, he made it his headquarters. It was later nationalized, and in the early years of the revolution it housed a temporary Soviet embassy. Seized by the moment, Machado pulled out a can of spray paint and on the wall of the Habana Libre he wrote the words “se fue” ― roughly, “he’s gone”. Then he uploaded the video to Facebook.

“My friends sometimes think that I knew I was going to end up in prison,” he told me. “But the truth is I imagined there’d be a party in the streets, celebrating freedom.” Just a few hours later, state security was outside his door.

Maldonado, better known by his artistic alias El Sexto, has become one of Cuba’s most prominent political dissidents in recent years, notorious for his anti-government artwork. His arrest late last year was just the latest of many; he was detained in the run-up to president Obama’s 2016 diplomatic visit, and in 2014 for a scheme that involved painting the names “Raúl” and “Fidel” on a pair of pigs and releasing them in the streets, an homage to George Orwell’s anti-totalitarian novel Animal Farm. “10 months in prison, that cost me.” he recalls. “I got out thanks to a ton of people who helped make sure people found out about it on social media: Amnesty International, The Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba.”

In the year since his most recent arrest made international headlines, Maldonado has been traveling outside of Cuba, promoting his art, speaking to audiences in various countries. In the aftermath of Castro’s death, many predicted a thaw in the Cuban government’s attitude toward political dissent. Instead, recent weeks have seen the detention of several prominent artists and activists on the island. “Robert Jiménez and César Mendoza are friends of mine,” says Maldonado, referring to two activists recently arrested in Cuba. “They’re human rights activists, but that’s dangerous… because the dictatorship prefers silence on the part of the people.”

Cuba’s 1976 constitution guarantees freedom of speech, with the caveat that such speech must be “in keeping with the objectives of socialist society”. In practice, that means that dissidents like Maldonado live in perpetual fear of a visit from state security. In another recent case, the artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara was arrested for illegal possession of construction materials. At the time, Otero was planning an independent artistic exhibition ― that is, one without government approval. The Cuban blogger Yoani Sánchez described the police action as a pretext to force him into an “endless legal process.” She says the government’s goal in such cases is twofold: to discourage and isolate dissidents, and to make them consider whether leaving the country might be their best long-term option. Call it self-deportation, Cuban-style.

Now, on the anniversary of Castro’s death, Maldonado and the dissident community see little cause for celebration. “The political environment on the island remains the same,” he told me by email. “I would even say it’s worse: total uncertainty.” In just a few months time, Fidel’s brother Raúl, who assumed the presidency in 2008, is slated to step aside, making way for an as-yet unknown successor. Details on the political process are not forthcoming. “There haven’t been candidates, or campaigns to show political proposals,” says Maldonado. “Everything seems to indicate that the next person in charge will come to power the same way as the current dictator, by inheritance, like in a monarchy. Maybe [Raúl’s] daughter Mariela Espín will be the next president.” Cuba observers generally agree that the most likely president-in-waiting is the current Vice President, Miguel Díaz-Canel. His record gives little indication that he might be a reformer; in a leaked video published to youtube in August by the Cuban dissident Antonio Rodiles, Díaz-Canel discussed plans for further crackdowns on “counter-revolutionaries”: specifically, independent media and political opposition.

Shortly after Maldonado’s release from prison in January, I reached him by Skype. I asked him why, in the case of his graffiti celebrating Castro’s death, he felt the need to combine art with vandalism. Why not express your political views without defacing public property? Maldonado scoffed at the very premise. “I don’t think it’s vandalism to paint on the walls in Cuba, where every wall belongs to the state,” he told me. “If they have the right to those walls, don’t I as well? Aren’t we all the ‘state’? Or is there some owner in particular? Once you put it that way, you can recognize clearly that it’s the dictator who owns every wall in Cuba.”

Maldonado traces his artistic and political thinking back to an interaction with his mother when he was only 9 years old. “I did a drawing of Fidel Castro, and I put a monkey head on him,” he remembers. His mother saw it and was horrified. “And she told me that you can’t do that and made me erase it.” His mother’s panic at a simple drawing puzzled young Danilo. “And from that moment I started to think.” Years later, he would become a street artist under the alias El Sexto. The name itself was a finger in the eye to the authorities; at the time, a team of Cuban espionage agents known as “The Cuban Five” were imprisoned in the U.S., and the government was busy lionizing them in official propaganda. So Danilo styled himself El Sexto, “The Sixth”. If the “Five” were the ideal of revolutionary zeal, then the sixth was just a regular guy. “El Sexto was a representation of the people… a kid, an old person, anyone,” explains Maldonado. “So that’s what the story of El Sexto was based on.” He started painting all over Havana.

After just over a year, the police finally caught up with El Sexto. “I was 26 or 27,” he recalls, “and they arrested me as I was leaving my house.” Danilo was “disappeared” for 4 days, exactly where to he wasn’t sure. Yet losing his anonymity had an upside; once the dissident community realized that he was behind the mysterious anti-government graffitis that had been popping up around the city, they were eager to meet him. “When I got out, they were all waiting at my house,” he says. It was then that he met Yoani Sánchez (the blogger mentioned earlier), and Gorki Águila, leader of the anti-Castro punk band Porno Para Ricardo. “I knew Gorki’s songs, and I had heard about Yoani on TV and even met her once; but to emerge from prison and see them waiting for you is something else!”

In the years that followed, Maldonado began to cultivate his image online and internationally, through interviews and an active social media presence. He realized that this could be a strategy for protecting himself from the state; in modern Cuba, the government sometimes treads lightly with its most famous or visible dissidents, fearful of international condemnation. “You can see that in the case of my friend and mentor Yoani Sánchez,” says Maldonado. “If not for this protection, I wouldn’t even be free to respond to your questions... but this doesn’t mean that I’m not vulnerable in a dictatorship like this one.” Nor is state retaliation against Maldonado himself the only risk he runs; his 18 year-old younger brother, who recently graduated from studying mechanics, was expelled from a job this month. Maldonado claims the decision was purely political. “Just for being my brother,” he says.

“I have to return [to Cuba] in the next two months and no one knows what will happen when I do. I miss my daughter, all my family, and my friends. I have to believe that everything will turn out ok.” When I spoke to Maldonado in February after his release from prison, he cited his daughter as one of the reasons he felt compelled to continue his activism. “I don’t want my daughter, because of an ideological difference, to not exist as a person. I want my daughter to think what she wants, to do what she wants, to present herself in life on the basis of her character… I don’t want anyone to be there to crush her dreams.”0

CAIRO (Reuters) - Gunmen who attacked a mosque on Friday in Egypt’s North Sinai brandished an Islamic State flag as they opened fire through doorways and windows, killing more than 300 worshippers, including two dozen children, officials said on Saturday.

No group has claimed responsibility, but Egyptian forces are battling a stubborn Islamic State affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.

The assault on a mosque has stunned Egyptians, prompting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in Egypt’s modern history.

State news agency MENA said the death toll had risen to 305, including 27 children, and 128 people were injured.

Egypt’s public prosecutor’s office, citing interviews with wounded survivors as part of its investigation, linked Islamic State militants, also known as Daesh, to the attack on the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of El-Arish city.

“The worshippers were taken by surprise by these elements,” the prosecutor said in a statement. “They numbered between 25 and 30, carrying the Daesh flag and took up positions in front of the mosque door and its 12 windows with automatic rifles.”

The gunmen, some wearing masks and military-style uniforms, had arrived in jeeps, surrounded the mosque and opened fire inside, sending panicked worshippers scrambling over each other to escape the carnage.

Witnesses had said gunmen set off a bomb at the end of Friday prayers and then opened fire as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. Images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.

“When the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,” Magdy Rezk, a wounded survivor, said from his hospital bed. “But I was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.”

UTMOST FORCE

Striking a mosque would be a shift in tactics for the Sinai militants, who have previously attacked troops and police and more recently tried to spread their insurgency to the mainland by hitting Christian churches and pilgrims.

Local sources said some of the worshippers were Sufis, whom groups such as Islamic State consider targets because they revere saints and shrines, which for Islamists is tantamount to idolatry. Islamic State has targeted Sufi and Shi’ite Muslims in other countries like Iraq.

The jihadists in Egypt’s Sinai have also attacked local tribes and their militias for working with the army and police.

Sisi, a former armed forces commander who supporters see as a bulwark against Islamist militants, promised the “utmost force” against those responsible for Friday’s attack. Security has been a key reason for his supporters to back him, and he is expected to run for re-election next year.

Egypt’s military carried out air strikes and raids overnight to target hideouts and vehicles involved in the attack, the army said, without giving details on the number of militants.

“What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,” Sisi said on Friday.

The Sinai attack came as Sisi’s government looks to draw more foreign investment and finish an IMF reform program to help revive an economy that struggled through instability after the 2011 uprising ousted long-standing leader Hosni Mubarak.

North Sinai, a mostly desert area stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, has long been a security headache for Egypt and is a strategic region for Cairo because of its sensitive borders.

Local militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, once allied to al Qaeda, split from it and declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. But attacks in the Sinai worsened after 2013 when Sisi led the overthrow of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule.-2

And in many countries (and even in Britain the past) that picture rings true. But when BBC News headed down to the Curry’s PC World on Oxford Street to film the expected onslaught at 7am, they were met with a different scene. The film crew found themselves capturing dramatic footage of one man walking in alone, smiling politely and thanking the staff for letting him.

The man in Curry’s was only going in to buy his pre-ordered laptop, according a reporter at the scene. Another man stood at the entrance and started to talk to a member of staff but didn’t seem to enter. The scene reflects a fall in the number of people clamouring for deals early, with analysis showing this Black Friday was a lot quieter in the early hours than last year. Overall, sales are down by 2% compared to last year, according to one e-commerce company. Photographers captured the “carnage” at 8am on London’s busiest shopping street.

Elsewhere, people were queueing in an orderly fashion to take advantages of deals.

By 1pm, the company said sales were down by 2% overall, attributing this to a longer discount period, as retailers offered deals earlier and will continue them later.

Ash from the eruption covered roads, cars and buildings near the volcano in the northeast of the island, while overnight a red glow of what appeared to be magma could be seen in photographs by Antara, the state news agency.

"Since last night the eruption has been a magmatic type eruption, not phreatic," Sutopo, a spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said in a Twitter message, referring to the switch from a steam-driven eruption to one with magma.

"That's what has caused the eruption to continue to produce smoke and dark volcanic ash."

Indonesia's Mount Agung volcano erupts as fishermen pull a boat onto the beach in Amed.

Vulcanologist Simon Carn said on his Twitter account:

"Summit glow at #Agung indicates magma likely at or near surface. Satellites also detected thermal anomalies overnight."

Bali, famous for its surf, beaches and temples, attracted nearly 5 million visitors last year, but business has slumped in areas around the volcano since September when Agung's volcanic tremors began to increase.

Agung rises majestically over eastern Bali at a height of just over 3,000 meters. When it last erupted in 1963 it killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages.

Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said in an advisory from it's Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VACC) in Darwin that the eruption was "expected to be ongoing".

Mount Agung volcano erupts as seen from Culik Village, Karangasem, on November 26, 2017.

Maps provided by VACC show an area of ash cloud heading southeast over the neighboring island of Lombok, away from Bali's capital, Denpasar, where the main international airport is located.

Indonesia also upgraded its Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation (VONA) to red, its highest warning, and said the ash-cloud top could reach 19,654 feet (6,142 meters) or higher.

However, officials said the airport would remain open for now as the ash could be avoided.

"The volcanic ash has only been detected in a certain area," the airport and other officials said in a joint statement.

All domestic flights and the airport itself were operating as "normal" and tests for ash had been negative, it said.

Mount Agung volcano is seen erupting from Glumpang village, Karangasem.

Yunus Suprayogi, general manager of Bali airport operator Angkasa Pura I, said food and entertainment would be provided as well as extra bus services if conditions changed and passenger numbers increased.

The airport would also "make it easier" for passengers to seek refunds and make other arrangements, he said, while noting that airlines had their own rules."

Carriers said they were assessing the situation on Sunday morning with several airlines including Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin resuming flights.

If ash tests came up positive, Lombok airport would be closed, airport officials said. Several flights to and from Lombok were canceled on Sunday, according to the airport's website.

Indonesia's disaster agency has said Bali is "still safe" for tourists except for a 7.5-kilometre (4.7-mile) zone around Mount Agung.

"Despite the string of eruptions, there has not been an increase in volcanic activity," it said in a statement, noting that the emergency status for Agung remains at level 3, one below the highest.

An initial eruption on Tuesday prompted Singapore to update its travel advisory for the island, warning ash clouds could "severely disrupt air travel".

China's Consulate in Denpasar warned citizens on Sunday to "be prepared for the possibility of being stranded" in Bali.

Aid Workers Reach Yemen After Blockade EasedGENEVA/SANAA, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Humanitarian aid workers and medical supplies began arriving in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Saturday, U.N. officials said, after the easing of a nearly three-week military blockade that sparked an international outcry.

Aid groups have welcomed the decision to let aid in but said flights are not enough to avert humanitarian crisis. About 7 million people face famine in Yemen and their survival depends on international assistance.

"First plane landed in Sanaa this morning with humanitarian aid workers," the World Food Programme's regional spokeswoman Abeer Etefa told Reuters in an email, while officials at Sanaa airport said two other U.N. flights had arrived on Saturday.

The U.N. children's fund UNICEF said one flight carried "over 15 tonnes" of vaccines that will cover some 600,000 children against diphtheria, tetanus and other diseases.

"The needs are huge and there is much more to do for #YemenChildren," the world body said on Twitter.

The U.N. had warned Yemen faced a mass famine unless aid deliveries were allowed to enter the impoverished country.

Airport director Khaled al-Shayef said that apart from the vaccinations shipment, a flight carrying eight employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross had also landed.

"Sanaa airport was closed from Nov. 6 until today, more than 18 days and this closure caused an obstruction to the presence of aid workers," he told Reuters in Sanaa.

"There are more than 500 employees trapped either inside or outside being denied travel as well as 40 flights that were denied arrival at Sanaa airport."

Colonel Turki al-Maliki, spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition that closed the ports, said three more aid flights had been approved for Sunday.

The coalition, which is fighting the armed Houthi movement in Yemen with backing from the United States, said on Wednesday it would allow aid in through the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif, as well as U.N. flights to Sanaa.

The Houthi militants control much of northern Yemen.

The coalition closed air, land and sea access in a move it said was to stop the flow of Iranian arms to the Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen.

The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward Riyadh. Iran denied again on Saturday supplying weapons to the Houthis.

Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said that Tehran would welcome the lifting of blockade and "any initiative that alleviates the pain of Yemeni people."

SHIP CLEARANCE

Maliki said on Friday that 82 permits had been issued for international aid missions since Nov. 4, both for Sanaa airport and Hodeidah, the country's main port where some 80 percent of food supplies enter.

"That includes issuing clearance for a ship today (Rena), carrying 5,500 metric tonnes of food supplies, to the port of Hodeidah," he said.

He told Reuters on Saturday that the commercial vessel had been checked and cleared by coalition navy forces and was approaching Hodeidah, but port officials said no ships had arrived yet and they were not expecting any to dock soon.

Aid arrived in Sanaa on Saturday 25th November 2017 after a three-week blockaid.

Maliki said new procedures aimed at blocking weapons transfers stipulate that aid and commercial shipments cannot be mixed on the same vessel, that requests require 72 hours notice instead of 48, and that only humanitarian workers can travel on aid flights.

The blockade has drawn wide international concern, including from the United States and the U.N. secretary-general.

Sources in Washington said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had asked Saudi Arabia to ease its blockade of Yemen before the kingdom decided to do so.

The heads of three U.N. agencies had earlier urged the coalition to lift the blockade, warning that "untold thousands" would die if it stayed in place.

The coalition has asked the United Nations to send a team to discuss ways of bolstering its verification and inspection mechanism program which was agreed in 2015 to allow commercial ships to enter Hodeidah.

The coalition joined the Yemen war in 2015 after the Houthis forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government to flee their temporary headquarters in the southern port city of Aden into exile in Saudi Arabia.

The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced over 2 million, triggered a cholera epidemic, and driven Yemen to the verge of famine. (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay and Stephen Kalin; Writing by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Alison Williams and Marguerita Choy)1

Official figures, released at the same time from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are devastating for this government’s claim to economic competence. Growth is down, and is now the lowest of major developed economies in the G7. Productivity growth, the fuel for wider economic growth, is the worst since it has been since the Industrial Revolution. The Institute for Fiscal Studies now talks about two “lost decades” for wages growth, with most people’s living standards not expected to recover until 2022.

The headlines figures are appallingly bad. And, as often with the OBR, much of the devil was in the details in their Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The effects of Brexit are “uncertain” but negative, under this government, who couldn’t provide enough detail on their approach to Brexit for their own forecasters to do their work “on the basis of fully-specified government policy”. A grim little note, on page 99, to the effect that the government’s fiscal position has been improved by “higher mortality rates at older ages than previously assumed”.

What the careful text doesn’t tell you is the human cost behind the figures. Cuts to Universal Credit, still going ahead, that will drive a million more children into poverty over the next five years. Cuts to local authority spending that will leave children’s services on the brink of what charities have called a “catastrophe”.

Austerity has not just failed, but failed so badly that a complete overhaul of government economic policy is now needed. What we got on Thursday instead was a series of sleights of hand from a Chancellor who seemingly cannot match up to the challenges ahead, and is in denial about the emergency in our public services. We needed real change from this government last Thursday: the funding that is being demanded, not by Labour, but by experts and professionals in our health service, our children’s services, and our schools.

What we got instead was an accountancy trick, shuffling Housing Association debt off the government’s balance sheet to flatter the its deficit, merely two years after bringing it on the books. But the housing crisis won’t be solved by financial trickery. It needs real funding and bricks-and-mortar. The £44billion announced for housing with such a fanfare on Thursday lunchtime turned, by Thursday evening, to be just £7billion in actual new funding. Without increasing the supply of housing, as Labour’s own manifesto promised, the cut to stamp duty for first time buyers is little more than a quick way to drive up prices – as the OBR noted. It forecast just 3,500 new buyers to benefit, with the main gainers from the policy being “people who already own property.”-1

It isn’t ‘So You Think You Can Dance?’ or ‘Come Dancing’ - it’s an entertainment show. “It’s been shown year after year that the public vote for their favourite dancers, so it’s not about dancing.” She continued: “If I came into the competition, it is difficult enough when you are faced with incredible dancers, it would make you feel terrible. “The point of ‘Strictly’ is that it’s a beautiful mish-mash of people who can dance and people who can’t, and about what you do for 90 seconds on the floor on a Saturday night. It shouldn’t change - it doesn’t need to. “The viewing figures are higher than they’ve ever been and people are loving what’s been happening.”

BBC Susan and Kevin have become surprise favourites with the public

Kevin was in agreement, adding: “It does come down to the people voting, and that’s what people forget. People are voting for who they like watching the most. They not necessarily have to vote for who is the best technically, they choose who they want to keep watching. “You don’t really need [the handicap] because that’s what the audience vote is for. If it was just a dance competition based on who’s the best, there would be no audience vote. It would just go on the judges scores and whoever is bottom would be eliminated.” During the interview, Susan also opened up about her friendship with J.K. Rowling, after the Harry Potter author was spotted in the audience supporting her last week. “We have a social media group - my little geek girl gang. We’ve been buddies for a few years and she’s an incredible support and a wonderful woman to know,” she said. “When you’re in a show like this and there’s suddenly a lot of attention on you, there’s no better person to ask in the world about attention than J.K. Rowling. She’s tremendously supportive. “She loves the show. I cannot tell you how many questions I get from them on a Monday morning about the show and the critiques of who’s done what.”

BBC J.K. Rowling was spotted in the 'Strictly audience

Despite being a “superfan” of the show, Susan doesn’t believe her pal will follow her onto the ‘Strictly’ dance floor. After Kevin requested Susan to get J.K. to do it in 2018, she replied: “I don’t think she wants to do it next year. She would only do it if she could dance with you and do a Harry Potter number.” Kevin laughed: “She sent me a collection of signed Harry Potter books, which was possibly the best day of my life.” “I don’t have that!” Susan joked. “He got a signed collection, and I’m like, ‘I’m right here!’” ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ airs on Saturday and Sunday on BBC One.-1

The position set out by Michel Barnier would make the application of new EU rules a condition of a transitional deal, meaning Britain could be subject to further Brussels’ regulations for about two years after leaving the bloc.

Theresa May hopes to secure an implementation period between the UK’s formal exit date and the commencement of any post-Brexit trade deal in order to give businesses time to adjust to the new arrangements, but accepting the imposition of new rules could trigger a revolt by Eurosceptics.

It would also go against the approach to an implementation period set out by the Prime Minister in her Florence speech, where she said the “framework for this strictly time-limited period … would be the existing structure of EU rules and regulations”.

But the Independent obtained a presentation drawn up by Mr Barnier for representatives of the 27 remaining EU members which said a transitional deal would involve the “automatic application in the UK of new EU rules post-30 March 2019”.

It also makes clear that after leaving the bloc the UK would have “no institutional rights, no presence in the institutions” and “no voting rights” – indicating that the UK would have no say over rules it would have to implement in the period.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has already indicated that accepting further regulations from Brussels would cross a red line, the Press Association reported.

He told the Sun in September: “You heard the Prime Minister say very clearly in Florence that she envisages the transition period being run under existing arrangements – that was the phrase she used, ‘The existing rules’.”

The Prime Minister wants talks on a trade deal and an implementation period to be given the green light by EU counterparts at the European Council on December 14-15.

But she has been warned by European Council president Donald Tusk that while that was possible it would be a “huge challenge”.

He has given her until December 4 to make progress on issues including the Brexit divorce bill and the thorny problem of the Irish border.

Alexandra Burke has slammed “sad” media claims she has been hit with during her time on ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ .

Speaking to HuffPost UK, Alexandra said: “We got really upset about that as it came from the Pride of Britain and we shared something from the training room when we were having a joke and a laugh and they took it out of context. Then it’s like, ‘I’m never letting you in again’.

“It was really sad, because it made me look like a horrible person.

“I’m telling you, every single [report] isn’t true. It’s laughable.”

Gorka agreed, adding: “The only time she screams is when she’s dancing and she goes ‘Wooooo!’.”

Speaking about the so-called feud she had with Debbie, which they had already denied on Twitter, Alexandra continued: “Debbie and I were doing an interview not too long ago, just before it came out that we had a feud. When it came out, I was like ‘Are you serious? What?!’. I don’t even know where it comes from.

“It’s just a shame really because, like at Blackpool, people see us having fun and having a great time, but people don’t want to write that stuff.”-1

http://cnn.com/2017/11/25/asia/myanmar-buddhist-nationalism-mabatha/index.htmlRohingya crisis: 'It's not genocide,' say Myanmar's hardline monksYangon, Myanmar (CNN) The monks, clad in vermillion robes and flip flops, line up from old to young to receive a meal in their alms bowls -- rice, vegetables, cookies -- all donated by local villagers.

It's a potent act of religious devotion that takes place every day across countless communities in Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist country.

But powerful clerical voices here believe their faith -- and by extension, these traditions -- is in danger.

The main threat? Islam, says Thaw Parka, a monk who speaks for a hardline, monk-led Buddhist nationalist group known as Ma Ba Tha -- the Association for the Protection of Race and Religion.

Its role in sowing anti-Muslim sentiment is coming under scrutiny as a brutal crackdown unfolds in Rahkine State in western Myanmar, sending more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh.

"It is not like what the international community is saying. It is not genocide at all," the 46-year-old abbot told CNN in September from ZayTaWon DammarYone Monastery on the outskirts of Yangon, where he leads more than 100 monks.

'Wild accusations'

Myanmar's military also denies genocide, saying it is targeting Rohingya militants that launched deadly attacks on police posts on August 25. Rohingya refugees speak of indiscriminate killings, rape and torched villages -- charges the military also reject . The UN has described it as a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing."

Thaw Parka describes these claims as "wild accusations" and believes Buddhists in the state are the main victims of the violence.

"Our ethnic people are starving. They abandoned their villages. It is impossible to make a living, (If) they remain in their village."

It's a view shared among many of the country's Buddhist majority, who have little sympathy for the Rohingya and have reacted defensively to the international outcry. Few use the term Rohingya, instead calling them "Bengali" -- a popular slur that compounds their reputation as illegal immigrants.

These attitudes confound the romantic image many in the West have of Buddhism as a tolerant faith whose adherents wouldn't hurt a fly. Monks, however, do have a long history of political activism in Asia that more recently has taken on an ultra-nationalist and extremist hue in places like Myanmar and Sri Lanka.

Buddhism under siege?

It's difficult to see how Muslims, or any other religious group, could pose a threat to Myanmar's dominant religion.

Almost nine in every 10 people in this country of 51.5 million are Buddhist, compared to a Muslim population of just 1.2 million. This doesn't figure include the estimated 1.1 million Rohingya Muslims, who are stateless as Myanmar refuses to recognize them as citizens, and they are not officially included in Myanmar's 2014 census data.

Thaw Parka says that he and his group work in harmony with "educated Muslims who live among the indigenous people of Myanmar" and he only opposes Muslim extremists and terrorists that threaten Myanmar's sovereignty.

"We have many Muslims among our friends. We hang out. We work together. We do charity work together. There was no problem. But with some Muslims who are in contact with a form of extremist terrorist, it is very difficult for peaceful existence."

The monks say their fears for their faith are also fed by wider concerns about a resurgent radical Islam and the belief that Buddhism is under siege.

Ma Ba Tha, Buddhist extremists, protest the use of the word "Rohingya" as a Rakhine donation ship from Malaysia arrives on February 9, 2017 in Yangon, Myanmar.

One English-language pamphlet produced in 2015 by the group as a "must-know, must-read, must-keep booklet for every Myanmar citizen," says different religions are "devouring" the faith of Myanmar. It warns that if Buddhist leaders don't take care "Buddha's teaching will soon disappear" -- something the booklet says already happened centuries ago in nearby Mulism-majority Malaysia and Indonesia.

Richard Horsey, a political analyst and one of the authors of a new report on Buddhist Nationalism by the International Crisis Group, says these fears are also a reflection of what modernity could mean for the monkhood as Myanmar opens up to the world under the new government of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.

"These monks look at Thailand, which has embraced a Western outlook and consumerism, and that has affected the standing of monks there," he says.

"They feel the (Myanmar) government is weak on the protection of Buddhism and keeping the morals of the country intact."

Thaw Parka acts as spokesman for Ma Ba Tha, a Buddhist nationalist group. He's also abbot of ZayTaWon DammarYone Monastery.

Suspicion of media

Ma Ba Tha has been at the forefront of anti-Rohingya protests since it first rose to prominence in 2014, It has also emerged as a political force, successfully lobbying for a series of laws aimed at restricting interfaith marriage.

Its most prominent face has been Ashin Wirathu, a controversial monk based in Mandalay . He spent time in jail for inciting anti-Muslim violence before founding the now banned "969" movement that called for a boycott of Muslim businesses.

In 2015, he told CNN that Muslims "take many wives and they have many children. And when their population grows they threaten us." "And," he concluded, "they are violent."

Thaw Parka said Wirathu had worked "hand in hand" with Ma Ba Tha since its inception. However, he stressed the firebrand monk didn't officially represent Ma Ba Tha -- a fairly loose coalition of monasteries and supporters.

"People want to attack U Wirathu, they cherry pick his extreme words," he said.

The monks view international media and their coverage of the Rohingya crisis with deep suspicion and carefully took notes during our hour-long interview.

"When we look at them, the news sources, (we find) that they did not investigate themselves. They fell for what (the Rohingya) said. They believed them and made accusations."

"We don't want to have these kind of grievances. You have to go to the affected areas and investigate yourselves."

Myanmar has largely blocked international media from traveling to the affected northern areas of Rakhine State and journalists that have been allowed to go have do so under government escort.

Crackdown

Ma Ba Tha remains popular in Myanmar despite efforts by the civilian government led by Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace prize winner who spent years under house arrest, to limit its influence.

In response, the group decided to change its official name to "Buddha Dhamma Parahita Foundation" but on the ground there's been little impact on the way the group operates, says Thaw Parka.

"There is no change. It is just taking down sign boards. Some do, some don't."

"We are in compliance with the constitution and we have a righteous stand," he adds.

Thaw Parka says his group supports Suu Kyi and the country's transition to democracy.

As international pressure mounts, the Myanmar leader has shown scant solidarity for the plight of the Rohingya Muslims and t here was little in her national address in September and subsequent comments on the crisis that would upset Buddhist nationalists like Ma Ba Tha.

Suu Kyi hasn't denounced the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya community and claimed the government needed more time investigate the exodus from Myanmar of more than 600,000 members of the minority Muslim group.

Next week, she'll host Pope Francis, who visits Myanmar for the first time. In the past, he has described the Rohingya as his persecuted "brothers and sisters" -- language that could inflame tensions in Myanmar where few use the word Rohingya, a politically and emotionally charged term.

'Much more than an extremist group'

The government's moves to rein in the group fail to take account of the fact that Ma Ba Tha is a social movement that appeals to many ordinary Buddhists, says Horsey, the political analyst.

Ma Ba Tha runs religious education classes, provides disaster relief, legal aid and "engages in a wide range of good causes at the community level," says the report he authored for the International Crisis Group.

Thaw Parka's monastery, like others, takes in orphans and educates the sons of poor families. Posters at the nearby Insein Ywama Monastery, which serves as the headquarters for Ma Ba Tha, offer classes in English, computing and coding for members of the local community.

"It's much more than an extremist group and efforts to ban it miss this point. It doesn't take account of the fact these monks are extremely revered," Horsey says.

"Wirathu has notoriety but many others involved in the group are seen as the leading monks in the country and they have enormous religious legitimacy."-2
http://cnn.com/2017/11/24/asia/china-kindergarten-abuse/index.htmlParents allege children were drugged and molested at Chinese kindergartenBeijing, China (CNN) A scandal of alleged child abuse at a Chinese kindergarten has rocked the country, prompting public outrage, parental soul-searching, government pledges and online censorship.

State-run Xinhua news agency reported that police have opened an investigation into RYB Xintiandi, a private kindergarten in Beijing, after numerous parents accused the school of drugging and molesting their children. Beijing's education authority confirmed the police investigation in a statement.

According to one parent - in a video posted on Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- at least eight parents told police that their young children had been drugged and molested, while attending the school.

The video has been viewed millions of times.

The unidentified mother told reporters Thursday her 3-year-old daughter said she was injected with a brown liquid by a teacher, made to strip along with other kids before being "examined" by a naked adult male stranger.

She said she and other parents allegedly found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies, adding that the kindergarten and the police had not allowed them to review videos from the school's surveillance cameras.

"My child said the teacher told them it was a secret and they were not supposed to tell anyone else including parents," the mother said. "She now bursts into screaming at night, saying: I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?"

The Xinhua state news agency reports that Beijing police have performed forensic tests and obtained surveillance camera footage from the kindergarten.

People leave the RYB Education New World kindergarten in Beijing on November 24.

Kindergarten apologizes, promises 'zero-tolerance' policy

The kindergarten is run by RYB Education, a Chinese company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

It operates in about 300 Chinese cities and has about 1,300 day care centers.

It announced the suspension of several teachers, and apologized to the parents and public for "causing serious worries" in a statement released Friday.

"We have provided the relevant surveillance videos and equipment to the police," it said. "Before a clear conclusion can be drawn, our priority is to help the students and their parents emotionally, and try to minimize the impact of the incident on the children."

CNN's repeated attempts to seek direct responses from the kindergarten and local educational officials on site were thwarted by security guards, who said no one would make additional comments beyond previously issued statements.

As more horrific details emerged, the government scrambled to respond to the incident. Both the national education ministry and the municipal education authority in Beijing have pledged cooperation with the police and swift investigations on their own, with local officials sending a team to the kindergarten.

People take photos of a notice posted by the RYB kindergarten announcing measures taken in response to allegations of children abuse in Beijing, Friday.

The company said it plans to keep the kindergarten open, promising to uphold a "zero-tolerance" policy toward child abuse and shoulder responsibilities pending the result of the police investigation.

The statement also said the head of the kindergarten involved had filed a police report that alleged "false accusations and being framed by certain individuals" - without specifying who.

It was relatively quiet around the RYB Xintiandi campus Friday, with some parents and onlookers gathering outside the gate where a copy of the corporate statement was posted.

One grandfather, who had just picked up his granddaughter but declined to be named, told CNN that the 4-year-old mentioned her classmates being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret.

Another resident of the neighborhood who identified himself as Mr. Liu said the kindergarten is the best in the area and costs as much as 5,000 yuan ($750) a month for bilingual class students. He said he was furious upon hearing the news, but still believes those were isolated cases based on what he had learned about the school from a relative whose child went there.

Public outcry grows

Many internet users, however, have angrily rejected RYB's response as "inadequate" and calling for severe punishment for those found responsible.

Past incidents involving RYB kindergartens included two cases in northeastern China where four RYB teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing more than 20 children.

Amid growing public outcry over the scandal, Chinese government censors seem to have moved to contain the fallout. Many users have complained about the disappearance of their posts on the subject on social media. Comment sections are turned off for many online news reports on this story.

Across Chinese cyberspace, however, parents of young children have started sharing tips on detection and prevention of such cases -- some directly copied from school literature in the United States.

Earlier this month, videos of teachers at a Shanghai kindergarten physically attacking kids and force-feeding them what appeared to be mustard went viral.

Shanghai police quickly detained several employees at the facility, while the municipal government's women's affairs agency, with which the kindergarten is affiliated, had to apologize to the parents and public.

Critics have long said current Chinese laws are too vague and lax on child abuse and sexual molestation cases.

Media in China have documented a rising number of incidents of abuse at childcare facilities, often in small cities and towns. In a lengthy investigative piece published last year, the Xinhua news agency said only 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported.-2
http://cnn.com/2017/11/09/health/metoo-training-men-boys-honor-women/index.htmlTraining men and boys to honor women in the age of #MeToo(CNN) As millions of women continue to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, men from all walks of life have responded.

Using hashtags such as #IHearYou #IWillSpeakUp and #HowIWillChange , they are pledging to treat women with respect and challenge other men when they don't.

If men need help keeping their pledge, the good news is that there are many established organizations with proven track records of helping erase men's ingrained attitudes toward women. The bad news: many of them have been providing resources to men for decades. So why haven't more men used them for self-reflection and change?

"Many men haven't felt this is their problem because they don't see themselves as the bad guy," said Ted Bunch, who co-founded A Call to Men , a men's violence prevention and socialization organization. "But what they don't understand is that even though most of us are not abusive, we are silent. And that makes us a bad guy."

"It's always been men's responsibility to prevent gender-based violence," agreed Neil Irvin, executive director of Men Can Stop Rape . "But you have to first see something as a problem before you can gain the skills to impact that problem in a positive way."

'We want to go upstream'

To create a lasting shift in how men treat women, experts say, prevention is key.

"The way we've always responded is through intervention after the fact," Bunch said. "Someone has to be harmed; someone has to go to the hospital; someone has to go to the shelter; someone has to go to human resources. We want to go upstream and prevent it so that it doesn't happen in the first place."

In A Call to Men's approach, trainers lead group conversations with men, usually ranging in age from 18 to 25; they also offer a nine-week middle- and high-school program called LiveRespect . Much of the conversation in these groups is focused on what A Call to Men CEO and co-founder Tony Porter calls the "man box": definitions of manhood that box men in and limit how they think and feel.

Harvard Medical School psychologist William Pollack calls it the "boy code" and has written extensively about his research on the constricting behavioral rules and regulations society places on boys as they mature.

"The Boy Code puts boys and men into a gender straitjacket that constrains not only them but everyone else, reducing us all as human beings," Pollack writes in his book, "Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons from the Myths of Boyhood."

Wearing a mask that is 'glued to your face'

RahK Lash was 19 when he attended A Call to Men seminar and felt an immediate connection to the concept of the man box. As the only son in a family of daughters, he says he grew up expected to conform to a narrow definition of manhood.

Rahk Lash holds a physical replica of the "man box."

"My father was an all-state running back; all my coaches went to school with him and expected me to be like him in baseball, basketball, wrestling," Lash said. "Personally, I was more interested in art, drawing and dance. But I pushed a lot of my own passions aside."

Once he got to college, he continued to feel restricted as he tried to match his behavior with what was expected by his fraternity brothers.

"I was raised with strong morals, but I didn't feel like I had the freedom to live my way," Lash explained. "I lied a lot, to fit into this masculinity game. It was tiring and exhausting trying to keep up the façade.

"I always felt like this wasn't me," he said. "It's like wearing this mask. And if you wear it too long, it becomes glued to your face. And you begin to think 'this is who I am.' "

It would take years, and a sort of reinvention, for Lash to shed his mask.

'Man box' training starts early

The strict, defining rules of the man box start at an early age for boys, Porter says -- much younger than you might imagine.

"The moment you tell a boy to stop crying -- and for some of us, that's about 3 years old -- you're teaching him to stop feeling," said Porter, the CEO of A Call to Men. "Boys are taught to have no fear, to be daring. Asking for help is also viewed as a sign of weakness, and that is also taught to our boys early on. We tell them to 'go figure it out on your own.' The only emotion young boys have permission to express is anger."

Justin Coulson, an Australian family psychologist who runs workshops with adolescent boys on sexuality and the impact of pornography, agreed: "It starts in those first few years. Studies show that even though Mum is working today, she still does most of the housework and parenting. Many young boys grow up watching and internalizing this."

Gender stereotypes are all too often reinforced at school, on the playground and in the classroom.

"By middle school, the message of what it means to be a man really takes hold," Porter said. "In elementary school, you can still tell boys to grab each others' hands, and they will do it, but middle school is when society's messages begin to really set in."

By the time a boy hits puberty, when studies show he will experience a decrease in empathy , he's probably been exposed to pornography that "illustrates women as objects to be abused and treated appallingly," Coulson said.

"Even though they know it's not 'real,' boys' beliefs about intimacy shift, along with sexuality," he added, "and their behaviors follow. The fact that they are swimming in a sexualized society that consistently highlights the dominance of men over women makes it almost impossible to avoid."

Men set the tone

The fight against gender stereotypes starts at birth, Coulson said, with men setting a good example.

"It's not just dads," he said. "Grandfathers and uncles, all the men who are in these boys' lives, have to be respectful and give women a voice. In my family, my wife and I work as a team. I'm not the final decision-maker; we are the decision-makers. Little kids pick up on that."

Of course, moms play a role in the socialization of men, too.

"We hear women say, 'I tell my son to man up, to stop crying, to toughen up,' because those moms are concerned that their boys will be seen as weak and less than a man," A Call to Men's Bunch said. "These rules that are in place are set up by men, and women are socialized by those rules. When men start saying things differently, women will, too. Men set the tone."

By preschool, experts say, it's time to monitor children's media intake, which is packed with prescribed messages on how a boy and a girl should look, feel and behave.

"We live in a culture that is saturated with disrespectful words and behaviors between men and women, and we need to put our effort into replacing those," said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.

"If you are watching TV, playing video games or listening to the radio with your children, you have constant opportunities to pull out a lyric or discuss a theme and ask them, 'Does this happen in your school? What do the kids say about it? What would you do if this happened to your friend?' "

Start talking about sex early, Coulson says. Most children know how babies are made by age 8.

"So get in there and pre-arm them," he urged, "so by the time they are in middle school, they understand kindness and consent and respect. Teach them 'yes' has to be an enthusiastic yes, and just because they said yes once doesn't mean they will say yes again. You need yes for each intimate interaction."

'Start where you are'

Most men today did not grow up in that optimal gender-neutral environment. Does that mean that it's too late for lasting change?

"If it's too late, then start where you are," Coulson said. "So if you've got a 15-year-old and you've never started, start today."

Porter's advice: "How do we engage boys and men? With what we call developing a voice. Men are on remote control, steeped in tradition, just doing what we've always done and blind to what is around us. So A Call to Men has various exercises, handouts, videos, social media, any tools that can create an 'aha' moment for men."

For Lash, the A Call to Men program was like "a breath of fresh air." After the seminar, he invited Porter to speak on his college campus and then started a men's organization that met monthly to discuss topics such as hypermasculinity, dominance and aggression.

He feels that multiple sessions are needed to establish rapport and break down the boys' initial defenses.

"When we initially start, there's always a lot of discomfort," Lash said. "The kids will say, 'We're not physically hurting girls. We're OK. We're the good ones' to show they are 'woke' and prove they don't need to be here in the seminar."

By the end of the program, he said, the boys will be coming up to tell him how they challenged an inappropriate comment by someone on their basketball team or on social media. He sees himself in their experience, as they learn to self-regulate.

"It's been a transformative experience," he said. "My internal voice, my moral compass, the voice inside my head now sounds like my father and Tony Porter. And that has helped me in so many relationships, as well as with my students, as I try to model healthy masculinity and shift the culture on campus. I know I'm very happy with the person I am now."0

Roy McClellan of Las Vegas was killed Nov. 17 while hitchhiking on State Route 160 in Pahrump, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Las Vegas.

His widow, Denise McClellan, told KSNV-TV she can’t understand why her 52-year-old husband survived the shooting, only to die in a hit-and-run. She says the mass shooting “was messing with his head” and that he was undergoing therapy.

The Nevada Highway Patrol says it is seeking the driver of a Chevrolet Camaro with front-end damage.

The digital currency climbed above $8,700 to a record high Saturday following increased investor interest around the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and Black Friday shopping.

Bitcoin rose more than 6 percent to a record high of $8,725.13, according to CoinDesk, trading around $8,674 midday on Saturday. Another digital currency, ethereum, also hit an all-time high of $485.18, according to CoinMarketCap.

"The move appears to be retail driven," said Brian Kelly, a CNBC contributor and CEO of BKCM, which runs a digital assets strategy.

The largest bitcoin exchange in the U.S., Coinbase, added about 100,000 accounts between Wednesday and Friday — just around Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday — to a total of 13.1 million. That's according to public data available on Coinbase's website and historical records compiled by Alistair Milne, co-founder and chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund. Coinbase had about 4.9 million users last November, Milne's data showed.

"Anecdotally, everyone I have talked to in the cryptocurrency community has said that Thanksgiving table discussion was all about bitcoin, and that inspired many family members to buy bitcoin," Kelly said. "I suspect that pattern was repeated across tables everywhere."

Bitcoin has multiplied more than eight times in value this year amid increased interest from institutional investors.

The world's largest futures exchange, CME, is planning to list bitcoin futures in the second week of December. The launch of a derivatives product for the digital currency will mark another step in establishing bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.

U.S. dollar-bitcoin trading volume accounts for 24 percent of total trading in the cryptocurrency, according to CryptoCompare. The Japanese yen has the largest share at 59 percent, while the South Korean won comes third at 10 percent, according to the website.

The bitcoin offshoot, bitcoin cash, traded slightly lower around $1,592, according to CoinMarketCap.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/millennials-could-ruin-holidays-for-department-stores-warns-swonk.htmlMillennials could ruin holidays for department stores, warns economist Diane SwonkStrong economy points to holiday retail cheer, but not for all, Economist Diane Swonk says 3:06 PM ET Wed, 22 Nov 2017 | 01:47

A permanent shift in spending could be more visible this holiday season, and economist Diane Swonk sees it coming at the expense of department stores.

"They can't seem to lure into the department stores those millennials," she said recently on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "The move from bricks to clicks, and the hybrid of the two is going to be a real problem."

Swonk, who runs DS Economics, is concerned this retail area is seeing a permanent secular shift — even as a strong economy and record-breaking stock market are expected to motivate consumers to open their wallets wider this season.

According to a recent National Retail Federation survey, 39 percent of consumers between 25- and 34-years-old plan to spend more than last season, with nearly a quarter of those 18 to 24 also adding to their shopping lists.

The NRF finds young adults will be spending the majority of their money on apparel, electronics, books, music and video games. Their top destination: online shopping.

"The department stores are really being left behind," said Swonk. "Overall, spending will do great this holiday season, but will it be enough to sort of stave off some bankruptcies going forward? I don't think so."

Even though department stores are expected to face more challenges, there are other areas expected to see a big boost.

"Not only are we spending on homes again because they're worth investing in again ... people are finally catching up on all that pent-up demand and repairs and remodeling," she said.

Swonk is also seeing strength in vehicle sales and some clothing categories.

But she notes most consumers are shifting to experiences from things this season, particularly going out to dinners, bars and traveling.

She observes weekend rates at hotels in crowded cities are now exceeding weekday rates, which are typically high due to demand generated by business travelers.

"We're now seeing that much travel. That's even with Airbnb," Swonk added.0

Their fellow celebrities and pro dancers awkwardly chanted for them to kiss live on air during Saturday’s (25 November) show.

BBC The 'Strictly' contestants tried to force Mollie and AJ into a kiss

The pair had just impressed the judges with their Quickstep routine to a reworked version of Rihanna’s ‘Umbrella’, which picked up 31 points, when their co-stars called for them to celebrate in a romantic way. Mollie and AJ didn’t bow to pressure though, with The Saturdays singer joking they would “all like it” if they did. The group later did the same chant to Susan Calman and Kevin Clifton, but the comedian wasted no time in locking lips with her partner.

Mollie recently insisted she is single, saying there was “always going to be rumours on ‘Strictly’”, but later declined to answer whether she would accept an offer from AJ if he asked her out. “I can’t tell you that! I have to see if he does! Who knows?” she told Metro. Elsewhere on Saturday’s show, Alexandra Burke fell from the top of the leaderboard after last week’s Blackpool special, when her Rumba to Beyoncé‘s ‘Halo’ divided opinion among the judges. However, she still scored 32 points and also picked up a further seven points during the show’s first ever Paso Doblethon, which saw all the couples take to the floor at the same time in a bid to pick up extra marks.

Gemma Atkinson also had a tough week when her Samba scored just 25 points but that was still four points above Susan, whose American Smooth to ‘Beyond The Sea’ landed her at the bottom of the leaderboard. Find out who is next to leave ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ on Sunday at 7.15pm on BBC One.0

I was 22, pretty much fresh out of university and I had landed a job at a small fashion PR consultancy, a stone’s throw from Vogue House.

I was so ill-equipped for the job, that in hindsight, I think I was like the Andy-experiment from The Devil Wears Prada film. I didn’t have the clothes, the connections, or the curve-less figure. But I did have a degree from a top university, drive and determination, and I LOVED magazines. I got the job by calling the consultancy directly and asking if they had any jobs – and my boss told me that it showed I could do PR. Fashion demanded perfection though. And I’ll never forget the time a colleague and I accidentally sent out an email with King Regards, instead of Kind Regards. We walked on eggshells for the entire day waiting to be given a dressing down. But, I digress.

For a girl like me, from an ordinary family of Caribbean immigrants, Vogue was not coffee table reading. I remember once we had a list of journalist names in the office, and I asked my colleague: “Who’s Alexandra Shulman?” Well, my boss heard that and exploded. How could I not know that was the editor of Vogue? She was completely stunned. That was one of the most important pieces of information I had to learn.

Note to self: learn the journalists’ names. So, I did. And when Vogue fashion director, Lucinda Chambers, came into the office to view the collections we represented, I was in awe. She arrived with a colleague, almost as if floating on the ether, dripping in fur and diamonds.

I remember feeling so inadequate the whole time I worked there, as I wore clothes that often cost £5 from the cheap shops in Harrow. My colleague had to show me how to hold a handbag, and I always looked a bit stiff and corporate. It took a couple of years before I learned how to dress like a media professional.

The gossip often turned back to the girl who had made it, someone called Marie Cre’ache. She was once just like us, I was told – a junior at the consultancy. Yet, she became a fashion features writer at Vogue. That was seen as mecca, and that was the jewel-encrusted carrot that was meant to get us through long days for little pay.

Yes, there is a reason why the fashion set are often whippet thin. The pay doesn’t leave much money for food, if you have to pay for rent and the latest labels.

I kept feeling that I didn’t fit in. Well, it wasn’t so much of a feeling, as a sledgehammer of unhappiness and displacement. I was relieved when I switched sides and went to work as a journalist for a less exclusive demographic.

Vogue was always something unattainable. Not something for me, despite my love of fashion, and style, and culture, and art. It was for girls who holidayed in Barbados, ate at The Ivy, and lived in Hampstead or Mayfair (at least that was what the fashion set, that I knew, were doing back in 1999).0
http://uk.businessinsider.com/finnish-bakery-make-high-protein-bread-made-with-crushed-crickets-2017-11A bakery in Finland wants humans to eat high-protein bread made with crushed cricketsA Finnish bakery is using ground flour from dried crickets.

Each loaf contains about 70 crickets.

It contains more protein than normal bread.

More than 2 billion people eat insects worldwide.

Finnish bakery and food service company Fazer has launched what it said was the world's first insect-based bread to be offered to consumers in stores.

The bread, made from flour ground from dried crickets as well as wheat flour and seeds, contains more protein than normal wheat bread. Each loaf contains about 70 crickets.

"The crickets are in the form of flour and they have been ground as a whole cricket and then made into dough and then baked to a very delicious product," said Markus Hellström, CEO of Fazer Bakeries.

The demand to find more food sources and a desire to treat animals more humanely have raised interest in using insects as a protein source in several Western countries.

In November, Finland joined five other European countries - Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Denmark - in allowing insects to be raised and marketed for food use.

A spokesman said Fazer had been developing the bread since last summer. It had to wait for legislation to be passed in Finland for the launch.

"It tastes like bread. It's really good....I don't know!" said Sara Koivisto, a student from Helsinki after trying the new product.

Due to a limited supply of crickets, the insect-bread will initially only be sold in 11 Fazer bakery stores located in Helsinki region hypermarkets, but the company plans to offer it in all 47 of its stores by next year.

The company buys its cricket flour from the Netherlands, but said it was also looking for local suppliers.

Fazer, a family business with sales of about 1.6 billion euros last year, did not give a sales target for the product.

Insect-eating, or entomophagy, is common in much of the world. The United Nations estimated last year that at least 2 billion people eat insects and more than 1,900 species have been used for food.

In Western countries, edible bugs are gaining traction in niche markets, particularly among those seeking a gluten-free diet or wanting to protect the environment because farming insects uses less land, water and feed than animal husbandry.

3. At least 305 people were killed and at least 128 others wounded when Islamic State militants detonated explosives and sprayed gunfire at a crowded Sufi mosque near Egypt’s Sinai coast.

One of the most striking aspects of the attack, the deadliest in Egypt’s modern history, was how easy it was for militants to carry it out.

The ruthless assault sent shock waves across the nation, not only for the death toll but also for the choice of target — mosques are rarely attacked. But Sufism, a mystical school of Islam that emphasizes the inward search for divinity, is hated by some extremists.

Italy, worried about meddling and fake news in its coming election, is asking Facebook to police its platforms. And Ireland could be headed toward a snap election, just weeks before it is set to play a central role in Britain’s planned exit from the European Union.

Brexit’s toll is already being seen as crucial European agencies relocate, an ominous sign of what may be to come.

The president continued his personal attacks against sports figures, many of them African-American. And he said he had declined Time magazine’s offer to be “named Man (Person) of the Year,” prompting the editors to tweet, “The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year.”

Among other topics he addressed: the allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers facing Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama. “He totally denies it,” Mr. Trump observed. By defending Mr. Moore, the president has further fueled hostilities within his party.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/magazine/what-children-and-parents-can-learn-from-baking-together.htmlWhat Children — and Parents — Can Learn From Baking TogetherPhoto

There’s a picture that I keep in the left-hand corner of my computer screen, of me and my son, Joshua, who is now grown, baking together years ago. It shows me bent over the kitchen counter gingerly disengaging a bell-shaped cookie from a large piece of dough. It looks as if it might have been gingerbread. Joshua — age uncertain, less than 3, I’d say — is standing on the stool we bought for just this job. He’s holding a cookie cutter, and there are more scattered about. We both have flour on our fingers; Joshua has some in his hair and on his sleeve, too. We’re both concentrating intently.

We baked together regularly but rarely took pictures. I wish we’d taken more. If we had, I think I would have seen us growing older, but not different. In the gingerbread picture, I recognize the curve I still make over the counter and the way Joshua holds his head when he’s focused, the way he keeps his arms close to his body when the task is intricate.

Our silhouettes would be the same today, and we would probably be doing the same things. Playing with the dough a little longer than any recipe would recommend. Molding miniature figures from the scraps. Licking bowls, spoons and fingers. Piling dishes in the sink and leaving them for later. Sitting on the floor in front of the oven window, watching our work rise, turn golden and set. Snatching hot cookies from the rack. Smiling, happy to be together in the warm room with the fragrance of butter and sugar and spice around us.

As Joshua grew older, what we baked didn’t change much. We made the cookies and plain cakes we had always loved and the ones we probably could have made without reading the recipes. What changed was how we worked together. I no longer needed to teach Joshua about baking. He no longer felt he had to show me what he could do. Our time in the kitchen was simply time to be together doing something we liked. Sometimes we would work silently, and sometimes the work became the backdrop for conversations on subjects we might never have broached outside the kitchen, without the comfort of dough in our hands and a familiar job ahead of us. These moments are written indelibly into our shared memory.

Something else was being written as we worked, too, something I didn’t really think about until last year. I had just finished a talk at a bookstore outside Los Angeles when a boy named Austin, age 2 1/2, walked over to have his copy of my cookbook “Baking From My Home to Yours” signed. The book weighed five pounds, and his mother helped him heft it onto the desk. It was smudged and dog-eared and lumpy in odd places. Austin started leafing through the book, and I saw why it was so misshapen: Every few pages there was a photograph of him with his mother and what they had baked. Under the image was the date. “‘I think of this book as his baby journal,” his mother told me. When Austin would come to a photo, he would point to it and say, “I made this!” Each time he said it, he lifted his head from the book, looked directly at me and smiled.1
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/style/mermaid-tiki-bar-sip-n-dip.htmlWelcome to the Campiest Place on EarthClaudia, one of the mermaids, said the hardest part of the job is staying in character. “Toward the end of a four-hour shift, your mind can start to wander,” she said. “Stuff like, ‘Did I remember to turn the coffeepot off when I left the house?’” (Claudia would not tell me her last name, explaining that she has a conservative day job. “I don’t know how corporate would react if they knew I was moonlighting as a mermaid,” she said.)

Ms. Johnson-Thares, whose family owns the O’Haire, recently drew statewide media attention by pushing against the accepted view of masculinity in Montana: She advertised online for a merman — Tuesday night at the Sip ‘n Dip is ladies’ night — and the posting went viral, prompting responses from senior Montana politicians.

“Dang, I’m overbooked,” Gov. Steve Bullock wrote on Twitter. Senator Jon Tester tweeted, “Shucks, I’m busy.”

Tim Fox, the state’s attorney general, weighed in with, “Speedo is @ the dry cleaners.” Ryan Zinke, a former congressman who is now the interior secretary, replied, “I got you covered brother. You can borrow mine.”

As it happens, the mermaids alone do not make the Sip ‘n Dip the campiest cocktail lounge in the history of campy cocktail lounges. (Honorable mentions to the Red Fox Room in San Diego and the velvet-wallpapered Bryant’s in Milwaukee.) Adding to the atmosphere is an 85-year-old singer: “Piano Pat.”

Pat Spoonheim has been an institution at the Sip ‘n Dip since 1963. (The bar opened in 1962 and has the original Naugahyde to prove it.) She still arrives three nights a week with a towering hairdo. She applies a little lipstick, adjusts the Ace bandage on her wrist and sits down at an electric keyboard encircled by Christmas lights. Ms. Spoonheim can be a little cranky — she’s sick and tired of “Sweet Caroline,” she’ll have you know. But she will accommodate the occasional request. She describes her style as “jazzy.”

“We’re rockin’ and rollin’,” she was shout-singing when I dropped in over the summer. “It’s Great Falls! On good-Ole Friday night!”

Two macho-looking dudes in cowboy hats lifted their drinks (blue concoctions topped with umbrellas) and roared in unison: “We love you Piano Pat.” A guy wearing a T-shirt reading “Beer, Bacon, Guns & Freedom” turned away from the mermaids long enough to clap. A husky lady with the remnants of a home perm fervently tapped her fork on a platter of meatloaf.

Oh, didn’t I mention the menu?

Despite its landlocked location, the Sip ‘n Dip has tiki décor. Blowfish and glass buoys hang from a thatched ceiling. There are velvet paintings, fake ferns and seashell lights. Behind the Formica bar, pink light glows upward through stacks of cocktail glasses. But the food is pure home on the range. There is a full menu. For $15.95, you can enjoy the Hog Heaven (pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, bacon bits). That meatloaf will also set you back $15.95. It comes with potatoes and gravy.0
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/style/kith-ronnie-fieg-nike-lebron-james.htmlKith’s Ronnie Fieg Knows Exactly What You WantKith is cited regularly in cool-kid publications like Hypebeast, Highsnobiety and Complex and has Reddit forums devoted to tracking its latest products. At its new three-story flagship store in Manhattan, which opened in October, customers regularly line up outside for the latest hoodie, jogger or sneaker, which typically cost $100 to $300.

Photo

“It’s really indicative of what is driving fashion today,” said Bruce Pask, the men’s fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, where Kith has in-store shops and customers have lined up outside for nearly every one of its releases.

Mr. Fieg “takes things that are part of a broad cultural conversation, things we can easily relate to, and really elevates them to a kind of iconic status,” Mr. Pask said. “Pretty much every drop he does we have a line outside. Their fan base is growing, their customers are motivated and excited. They’re the new faces of young American design.”

Mr. Stambaugh said, “Traditional brands have a four-season calendar. With Kith, it’s basically 52 drops a year. Every single week we’re releasing things.”

Along with other companies that built their business models around the drop, such as Yeezy and Supreme, Kith has defined this particular moment in the purchasing patterns of tweens, teens, 20- and 30-somethings.

On Dec. 30 Kith will likely set off yet another frenzy with its take on the LeBron 15, a sneaker LeBron James created with Nike. The design features a wide strap that snakes around the shoe with “Long Live the King” printed on it. There are no laces; just a zipper on the side. Mr. Fieg expects the sneaker to sell “extremely well.”

The release will cap off a flurry of activity for the company. In the last several months Kith has opened an outpost of Kith Treats in Tokyo and a children’s store; put on its second fashion week show; and created products in partnership with Coca-Cola, Vogue, Bergdorf Goodman, Off-White, Nike, Adidas and the restaurant Carbone.

It is difficult to define the boundary between Kith the label and the man behind it. Asked what he likes to do in his free time, Mr. Fieg was silent for a moment, then turned to his executive assistant, Stacey Root. “I’m going to let Stacey answer that question,” he said.

Photo

“Ronnie has no time for anything but Kith,” Ms. Root said. “Kith is his hobby.”

“The truth is I don’t ever turn off,” Mr. Fieg said. “I’m not sure if it’s the most sustainable way to work. But right now I just think it’s a crucial time.” After a pause, he said, “It’s always a crucial time.”

Mr. Fieg has been developing his tastemaker status since he turned 13 and asked his second cousin David Zaken, the owner of the David Z chain, for a job at one of his shoe stores instead of bar mitzvah money. He began taking the F train from the final stop on the line, near his parents’ house, to the West Village, after school and on weekends. At the time, the block where he worked, Eighth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, was a gathering spot for some of the decade’s biggest stars.

“On the weekend the cars were parked diagonally on the block,” Mr. Fieg said. “The cops would let it ride.” He ticked off the names of customers who came in while he worked on the floor and in the stockroom: Biggie Smalls, Busta Rhymes, Nas, Missy Elliott, Tyson Beckford, Wu-Tang Clan, the Fugees. “Jay-Z used to come in every Saturday and buy two pairs of construction Timberland boots from me,” Mr. Fieg said. “He would leave his old pairs there and buy two fresh pairs.”

From customers like these, Mr. Fieg would learn about the cool new thing and bring that knowledge back to Cardozo high school. “I’d come in dressed a certain way and get laughed at, and then all of a sudden everybody is wearing the same stuff,” Mr. Fieg said. “New Balance was the thing back then, and they’d be like, ‘Why are you wearing orthopedic sneakers?’ And I’d explain, ‘These are premium, made-in-U.S.A. runners.’”

Mr. Fieg has an intuitive understanding of what his customer wants because in many ways he is his customer. “I want a Bergdorf Goodman varsity jacket, and I want it to be multicolor in these regal colors, and then I make it and I wear it,” Mr. Fieg said. And then his followers wear it, too.

Before he was even a teenager, Mr. Fieg desperately wanted a pair of Reebok pumps, but his parents couldn’t afford them, so his mother bought him a pair of Asics Gel Lyte III sneakers instead. Mr. Fieg was disappointed at first (“I was crying,” he said), but he eventually came to love the shoes and wore them into the ground. When he asked for another pair, it turned out they were discontinued.

In 2007, when Asics offered him the chance to bring back one of its archival models, Mr. Fieg immediately knew which one he would resurrect. The collaboration and the story behind it brought Mr. Fieg a lot of attention and established him in the sneaker scene.

His foray into apparel similarly started from his desire to make a thing that he wanted to own. In late 2012, he received a pair of Scotch & Soda pants that he thought didn’t fit well so he tailored them to make them look like twill joggers. “People were asking me about my pants more than they were asking me about my shoes, and I’m always wearing the best shoes, so it was weird, right?” Mr. Fieg said.

After some small-batch experimentation, he hired Mr. Stambaugh and started producing and selling clothing in earnest, using the same limited-run model that has worked so well for him with sneakers.

“This is the way of the future: passionate, small brands, where scarcity is an element,” said Lawrence Lenihan, the co-founder and co-chief executive of Resonance, a company that invests in early-stage fashion brands. (Kith does not have any investors). “This is art. You don’t buy a painting and there are 150,000 versions of it. There’s one. I think it’s a viable alternative to these fast-fashion giants that are crushing everybody.”

But Mr. Lenihan noted that “cool is a depreciating asset. The more you use it, the faster it depreciates.” Surprise collaborations are only exciting while they remain surprising. “As more of these collaborations happen, the energy disappears,” Mr. Lenihan said. “It becomes, ‘Oh my God, another one of these.’”

Mr. Fieg acknowledged that there is pressure on him to stay ahead of the curve, to know what his customer will want long before he wants it and to choose whom he works with wisely. “The hardest part about what I do for the brand is really controlling where we go and where we don’t go,” he said. “I’m working on projects for a year from now. The market and the whole concept of retail is continuously changing by the day.”

Outside of the high school where he first began the work of spreading the Ronnie Fieg style gospel, Mr. Fieg reminisced about the days of riding bikes, skipping class and hanging out with his friends on the basketball team. “What I would do to go back to that time,” he said. “Having the brand be as big as it has gotten, I have a lot of responsibilities now. Back then it was a free-spirit thing.”

He was distracted from his memories by the sight of about two dozen students congregated by the bus stop. His eyes went straight to their shoes, and he scanned the Timberlands and the Nikes. “Not as fly as when I was here,” he said. “But you know, that’s the Ronnie effect.”0

New York (AFP) - American consumers arrived en masse in stores - and online - for the annual Black Friday shopping extravaganza that opens the US holiday shopping season.

Held the day after Thanksgiving, a period when schools are out and many offices are closed, Black Friday has evolved over the years into a massive shopping occasion known for "doorbuster" sales and other promotions to lure consumers into stores.

Retailers have also added a plethora of discounts online starting on Thanksgiving Day, accelerating on Black Friday and culminating on "Cyber Monday" just after the weekend. That has inevitably dented some of the consumer traffic at brick-and-mortar stores, although tens of millions were still expected to brave the crowds.

Those with online Black Friday promotions Friday included the Rockettes dancing group, the New Yorker magazine and President Donald Trump's campaign, which offered 30 percent discounts on all items, including the iconic red "Make America Great Again" baseball caps.

According to a survey by accounting firm Deloitte, 54 percent plan to conduct a majority of their holiday shopping in December or January, while 26 percent plan to do it in the period between Black Friday and "Cyber Monday," and 20 percent will complete most of it in the period before Thanksgiving.

For the first time since Deloitte began conducting the survey 32 years ago, consumers expect to spend a majority of their funds (51 percent) online compared with in-store (42 percent), with seven percent going to catalogue or other types of purchases.

"Shoppers flock to phones," read the front-page headline of Friday's Wall Street Journal.

While the estimates vary as far as what share online comprises of overall sales, there is little debate about the broader trend.

"The one thing that is clear is that more and more is being bought online," said Chris Christopher, executive director of IHS Markit, which expects online sales to account for 18.3 percent of overall holiday sales, up from 16.8 percent last year.

The IHS figures are based on US Census spending patterns and includes groceries, among other categories,

Amazon on Friday announced a slew of offerings for Cyber Monday, including discounts on toys, televisions, fashion and Amazon devices such as the Echo program, which can link to the Alexa Voice Service. Customers last year ordered more than 64 million goods on Cyber Monday, 740 items per second, Amazon said in a news release.

- Booking appointment with Santa -

Faced with the rising popularity of e-commerce, brick-and-mortar retailers are redoubling efforts to try to draw consumers into stores. Macy's, for the first time, began booking advanced reservations for visits with Santa Claus, a response to time-strapped parents.

"Santa's a popular guy, so the wait times to meet him have been quite long in previous years," Macy's says on its website.

"New this year, Santaland is by reservation only ... Make your free booking right here," reads the website, adding, "Time slots are subject to availability."

Retail experts are generally upbeat about the overall prospects for this year's holiday shopping performance. Unemployment stands at just 4.1 percent, US growth stands at about three percent and US stock markets are in record range.

Consumers surveyed by the National Retail Federation said they expect an average spend of $967.13 this season, up 3.4 percent compared with the average in the year-ago survey.0

"We have fully resolved today’s system issues," Macy's said in a statement. "We highly value our customers and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience today’s system slowdown may have caused during their shopping experience. The delays we experienced this afternoon were due to a capacity-related issue that caused some transactions to take longer to process. We do not anticipate any additional delays."

Earlier in the day at the Macy's in downtown Chicago, one salesclerk had to enter credit card numbers manually. Most purchases, appeared to go smoothly, however, and lines at the registers did not appear to have more than five to six people queued.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/26/support-for-irish-pms-party-falls-as-snap-election-nears.htmlSupport for Irish PM's party falls as snap election nearsSupport for Ireland's governing Fine Gael party fell in a poll on Saturday as a political crisis that has left the country two days away from the calling of a snap election showed no sign of being resolved.

Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's minority government was on the brink on Friday after the party propping it up submitted a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister, weeks before a summit on Britain's plans to leave the European Union where Ireland will play a key role.

Varadkar has said that if the motion put down by Fianna Fail, the main opposition party, is not withdrawn by Tuesday, he would be forced to hold an election before Christmas.

Support for his party dropped two points to 27 percent in the Sunday Business Post/Red C poll, only marginally ahead of the 25.5 percent it achieved at last year's election and its worst performance in recent opinion polls.

Fellow center-right party Fianna Fail rose to 26 percent from 25 percent a month ago and leftwing opposition Sinn Fein were up two points to 16 percent, both also marginally higher than the last election.

The survey was taken between November 20 and 24, the day the crisis escalated rapidly and suggested the parties would struggle to form anything but another minority administration.

"Again (the poll) suggests no one wins at a Christmas election if these numbers hold," Richard Colwell, the chief executive of Red C, wrote on Twitter.

Varadkar has said that there is still time to avoid the snap poll but neither side were stepping down on Saturday ahead of the motion of no-confidence, to be debated on Tuesday.

"Although the leaders will do their best, it is unlikely that the positions are going to shift between now and Tuesday, and if that is the case the only way we can prevent an election is for the Tanaiste to resign," senior Fianna Fail MP Jim O'Callaghan told national broadcaster RTE.

The Tanaiste is the name given to the position of deputy head of government in Ireland, currently held by Frances Fitzgerald.

Health Minister Simon Harris said the price of any talks over the next three days "will not be the head" of the deputy prime minister and that the agreement with Fianna Fail that allows the minority government to function was "extremely badly damaged."

Varadkar is due to play a major role in the December 14-15 EU summit on Brexit, telling fellow leaders whether Dublin believes sufficient progress has been made on the future border between EU-member Ireland and Britain's province of Northern Ireland.

The government has said enough progress has not been made to date.

The border is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly resolved before it decides whether to move the talks on to a second phase about trade and EU officials have said a snap election in Ireland would complicate that task.0

The Irish Republic's EU commissioner has said Dublin will "play tough to the end" over its threat to veto Brexit talks moving on to discuss trade.

The European Union has said "sufficient progress" has to be made on the Irish border before negotiations on the UK and EU's future relationship can begin.

Phil Hogan told the Observer staying in the customs union would avoid the need for a hard border on the island.

The DUP said Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK must not be different.

Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, which is in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative government, said she would not support "any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations".

Downing Street has said the whole of the UK will leave both the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU in 2019.

Labour said nothing should be done that endangers the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, while the Liberal Democrats said Tory divisions over Brexit were "stoking tensions".

'Blind faith'

The EU has given Prime Minister Theresa May until 4 December to come up with further proposals on issues including the border, the Brexit divorce bill and citizens' rights, if European leaders are to agree to moving on to trade talks.

But Mr Hogan, the EU's agriculture commissioner, accused some in the British government of having what he called a "blind faith" about securing a comprehensive free trade deal after Brexit.

He said it was a "very simple fact" that "if the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue".

In these circumstances regulations either side of the border would remain the same, and so a near invisible border would be possible.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has asked for assurances of no hard border

The Irish government has always insisted there must not be a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saying he must have written assurance from the UK before Brexit talks can move on.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has also said the UK's desire for no hard-border on the island of Ireland was "aspirational".

There could be no movement to phase two "on the basis of aspiration", he said.

But in her speech in Florence, this September, Mrs May restated that both the UK and EU will not accept any physical infrastructure at the border.

'Desperately worried'

Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told Sky News: "We don't want there to be a hard border but the United Kingdom is going to be leaving the single market and customs union."

He said progress towards a deal must be quicker and accused EU negotiators of making the so-called "divorce bill" a sticking point, adding: "We can't get a final answer to the Irish question until we get an idea of the end state."

Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the Irish government was "desperately worried" about the possibility of a hard border.

He said Labour had not ruled out advocating membership of the single market or, if necessary, some form of customs union.

But he declined to commit to a preferred solution, arguing that Labour was not in government and therefore not involved in the Brexit talks.

"I'd be very happy if Theresa May wanted to move over and call that election and let us do that, but until we're round that table it's not sensible to say what you can get out of the negotiations," he said.

Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: "Government divisions over what Brexit means are stoking tensions. The government and its Brextremists must swallow their pride and do the right thing for Ireland and the UK.

"Leaving the EU does not have to mean leaving the single market and customs union."

Suggestions for alternate arrangements have included a new partnership that would "align" customs approaches between the UK and the EU, resulting in "no customs border at all between the UK and Ireland".0
http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42128073Archbishop of York ends decade of protest over MugabeThe Archbishop of York has put on a dog collar for the first time in almost 10 years, ending his symbolic protest over Robert Mugabe's leadership of Zimbabwe.

In December 2007, Dr John Sentamu cut up his dog collar live on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, promising not to wear one until Mr Mugabe left office.

He said Zimbabwe's leader had "taken people's identity" and "cut it to pieces", prompting him to do the same.

On Sunday, he returned to the Marr Show and reinstated his collar as promised.

Mr Mugabe left office dramatically on Tuesday after 37 years of authoritarian rule.

Dr Sentamu said: "Normally I [would] tie the top button and put on my collar, but for nearly 10 years I haven't be able to. It has meant every morning I think of the people of Zimbabwe."

After Andrew Marr presented him with an envelope containing the cut up pieces of his collar, Dr Sentamu said: "You've been a very faithful friend, you've kept them - that's lovely.

"I could attempt to put this one back together using superglue, but it would be a pretty ropey collar. And I actually think the message for Zimbabwe is the same. They just can't try and stitch it up. Something more radical, something new needs to happen."

Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe?

Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile'

What's next for Zimbabwe?

He said Mr Mugabe may have gone, but the new President Emmerson Mnangagwa - who was sworn in on Friday - was "still implicated in a lot of things".

Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980.

Dr Sentamu added: "It's quite possible that Mnangagwa could be a very, very good president. But he can't simply bury the past - it won't go away."

He also said it could be possible for Zimbabweans to forgive Mr Mugabe.

"Mugabe needs to say at some point to Zimbabweans: 'Forgive me'. He's a very, very intelligent man and I think he is capable of doing it."1
https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-what-the-ideal-body-for-men-and-women-looks-like-2016-2Here's what the 'ideal' body for men and women looks likePhoto: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images.

*This article was originally published on February 23, 2016.

A 2011 British survey found 12% of women would give up two to ten years of their lives just to be their ideal weight, while 29% of men think about their appearance at least five times a day. So what makes an ideal body, and why do we want one so badly?

A good place to start is by looking at “hyperideal” bodies – representations of bodies that are culturally situated as ideals. We measured catwalk models, shop mannequins, supermodels, porn stars (OK, we didn’t actually measure the supermodels and porn stars, we got their data from the internet) and even Barbie and GI Joe “action figures” (not dolls!), whom we measured with adjustable rulers and dental floss.

Shapeliness and thinness

What’s common to these bodies? For female bodies, it can be summed up in two words: shapeliness and thinness. The body mass index (BMI, the square of weight in kilograms divided by height in metres) of the average Australian woman is about 27. In exercise science students it is 22, in catwalk models 20, in porn stars 18, in supermodels 17.5, in shop mannequins 17 and in Barbie 14.5 (a level achieved by about one in every 100,000 Australian women, usually as a result of some life-threatening condition).

The hyper-ideal female body is not only thin, it is also shapely. This makes it tough, because thin women tend not to be shapely, and shapely women are not usually thin.

The ratio of waist-to-hip girth is a simple shape measure which is a consistent index of how attractive men (and women) find women’s bodies. Lower is better, but within limits. Men lust after women with ratios about 0.6-0.7, a range that happens to include Kim Kardashian (0.65), Angelina Jolie (0.66) and Scarlett Johansson (0.72). The average young woman scores about 0.75, models 0.70, porn stars and supermodels 0.69 and Barbie 0.56.

Sophisticated readers of The Conversation will not, I’m sure, be taken aback to learn bust size also matters. Barbie’s bust-to-waist ratio is 13 standard deviations above the mean.

We developed a simple measure of whole-body female shapeliness, the Hourglass Index, which is the bust-waist ratio divided by waist-hip ratio. In this case, higher is better. Astronomical is better still. For athletic young women, the Hourglass Index is 1.8. It is 1.9 for models, 2.0 for shop mannequins, 2.1 for porn stars, 2.2 for supermodels and a quite dizzying 3.5 for Barbie.

The recent vogue for supersized derrières has led to some impressive Hourglass Index values: 2.2 for Ms Kardashian, 2.3 for our Australian representative, Iggy Azalea, 2.4 for Angelina Jolie, 2.9 for Nikki Minaj. Rapper Coco Austin allegedly scores 3.0.

The ideal face

Science has thrown up some interesting observations on facial beauty. A celebrated study asked people to rate the attractiveness of female faces. In both the UK and Japan, the key differences between “beautiful” and “plain” faces were the same: a more rounded jaw, more arched eyebrows, larger eyes and smaller distances from the tip of the chin to the lower lip, and from the upper lip to the bottom of the nose.

Facial symmetry is also important: men, women and babies prefer more symmetrical faces. Men with symmetrical faces report more sexual partners, and symmetrical couples report more orgasms. Facial asymmetry increases with age.

One possible reason is that symmetry may be a visible marker of the ability of the body to resist infection and injury, and hence an “honest advertisement” of good genetic material. Alas, when we measured facial symmetry in our lab, I had the least symmetrical face of all of us. At least my wife can be confident about my faithfulness.

Male attractiveness

But enough of boobs and booties, what about the boys? The boys are suffering, too: 30% of young Finnish males report severe dissatisfaction with their muscularity, with 12% using supplements or steroids.

Male attractiveness to both men and women is related to a triangular body shape: broad chest, narrow hips, high chest-to-waist ratio. Male shop mannequins are not especially muscular – in fact they are quite slight – but they are abnormally tall (about 187 cm) and very broad in the shoulders and narrow in the hips.

Men, but less so women, are attracted by high muscularity. The average size of GI Joe’s biceps more than doubled between 1965 and 1995.

Why is this the ideal?

So why do we find thinness and shapeliness attractive? The argument is at the front line of the Culture Wars. Cultural theorists argue that beauty is socially constructed (what isn’t, these days?) and is as subject to cultural relativism as preferences in fashion or food.

They cite as evidence historical ups and downs in preferences, from the voluptuous dimples of Rubens to the stick-insect figure of Twiggy.





We are conditioned, they say, by the models we have around us, and historical churn in body image is designed to keep us in a state of perpetual dissatisfaction, driving the cosmetic, fashion and fitness industries. Cultural relativists argue that we could be persuaded to fetishise a cardboard box if Rupert Murdoch set his mind to it.

Sociobiologists, on the other hand, argue that thinness, shapeliness and symmetry are markers of youth and fecundity – the readiness of women to bear children, and the virility and strength of men – and that we are programmed to find these traits attractive.

Ideal female and male body shapes exaggerate stereotypical sexual characteristics: big breasts, big bottoms, narrow waists for women; broad chests and big biceps for men. There have been societies that lean towards shapeliness, and societies that lean towards thinness, but there never has been a society that idealises fat, shapeless bodies.

The age-old question whether the "right" way to have the end going over the top of the roll or under, coming from the side closest to the wall, is as old as time. It's a controversial topic that has torn apart families, and now we have a definitive answer to the question: The right way to hang your toilet paper is with the end going over the top.

Inc. reports that a recent study conducted at the University of Colorado, the "right" way to over because with that method you'll only touch the toilet paper you're personally using.

Bathrooms, especially public ones, are chock full of bacteria.

If you hang toilet paper using the under method, then there's a good chance your hand will brush the wall when you go for a few squares, which will cause you to potentially leave bacteria on the wall, or pick up something that a previous bathroom guest left there.

With the over method, you can easily avoid the wall and get the paper you need.

Another interesting insight from the study: If you do manage to get bacteria on your hands, you need to wash them for a long time to get it off. To thoroughly clean your hands you need to scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, which is long enough to sing Happy Birthday twice. If you don't, that hand washing essentially did nothing.0

LEWIS Hamilton’s early championship celebrations have blown the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix wide open. The 2017 champion will start from second on the grid behind teammate Valtteri Bottas. Sebastian Vettell and Daniel Ricciardo will start from the second-row after they showed in qualifying their teams can match Mercedes in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The race begins at 11pm (AEDT).

Webber’s advice to Ricciardo Aussie F1 great Mark Webber has advised Daniel Ricciardo that he may have to leave Red Bull. Webber feels his countryman might have to move if his relationship with his teammate Max Verstappen deteriorates, The Sun reports. The two fell out in Budapest this season following a collision but for the best part of the campaign have remained friends. Yet with the Dutchman having been offered a new deal by Red Bull and with Ricciardo still waiting, Webber feels the harmony in the team could change. He said: “It is the big dynamic that has changed is that Max has signed. He has rocked everyone’s establishments, not just Daniel’s. “Daniel is one of the top guys but he is going to have to have a fight with him in the future at Red Bull or another team. “The big thing is if Red Bull can do a Mercedes and manage an unbelievable campaign with Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. “If they can it would be great but if they can’t he might have to move teams, because all the top teams are looking at him. “What Max has done is extraordinary but on Sunday afternoons, Daniel is immense. It’s just the way that when someone young comes in, the momentum builds.” Share

Ricciardo’s final threat before Abu Dhabi Grand Prix DANIEL Ricciardo has warned Red Bull that he could join Ferrari or Mercedes if they are off the pace again next season. The Aussie is out of contract at the end of 2018 and says he is keeping his options open as he prepares to handle negotiations himself, The Sun reports. The 28-year-old is currently fourth in the championship and has one win to his name this season and nine podiums. However, there is a widespread feeling that it could have been more had it not been for Red Bull’s slow start to the season, plus an under-strength Renault engine. Ricciardo said: “I would not guarantee anything now. I am not saying I going to be staying here 100 per cent or say that I am leaving. “Performance is the key. That will be the biggest dictator and obviously other teams will have to want to take me or Red Bull want me to keep me. “But if everyone wanted me, then performance would be the big tick for me. I am excited about it because it is new and different. “I have had the stability for the last few years, so why not rock the boat a little bit. “But I am happy with the team and for me to be driving well, I need to be happy and enjoy the environment, but we will see.” — Ben Hunt, thesun.co.uk Share0

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-legal-power-put-mulvaney-150227250.htmlTrump asserts legal power in fight over consumer bureau(Adds quotes from lawyer, additional background)

By Roberta Rampton and Idrees Ali

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - P resident Donald Trump has the power he needs to put his top budget aide in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), federal officials said on Saturday, weighing in on a battle for control over the powerful agency.

The leadership of the independent regulatory agency was thrown into question on Friday when its outgoing director Richard Cordray, a Democrat, named his deputy as his acting replacement until the U.S. Senate confirms a new director.

The CFPB was created by former Democratic President Barack Obama in the wake of the financial crisis and has imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies for alleged predatory lending practices.

Trump named White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a fierce critic of the agency, to temporarily oversee the CFPB until he nominates someone to take on the job - a pick expected in upcoming weeks, senior administration officials told reporters on a conference call.

Democrats, accusing the White House of finding a backdoor method to defang a banking watchdog, point to language in the Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB, stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves.

But administration officials said the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives presidents the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards - an exemption that they said did not apply to the CFPB.

"We believe this move by the president is a typical routine move exercised by presidents," said one of the officials, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, noting the White House had sought guidance from the Justice Department before Trump named Mulvaney to the job.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will soon publish a formal view, the officials said.

Cordray was the CFPB's first director, so this is the first time the agency's succession plan has been tested.

Republicans have complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from Congress on its operations. Industry critics said the succession battle was a case in point of how the agency had too much power.

"The CFPB's current governing structure is a dictatorship, period," Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.

Democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair to put Mulvaney - who once described the CFPB as a "joke" - in charge.

Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' financial services committee, said the appointment would give Mulvaney a seat on the boards of two other financial regulatory agencies.

"The White House would have an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement," Waters said in a statement.





'ENORMOUS CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY'

Trump's nominee must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, meaning that Mulvaney could be the acting director for months.

The fight has raised practical questions about how the agency would operate when its doors open on Monday.

The White House has not been in touch with Leandra English, the deputy who Cordray put in charge, officials said, saying they expected she would be at work on Monday and continue as Mulvaney's deputy.

"We don't have any reason to think that anything out of the ordinary course will happen: we think (Mulvaney) will show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working," a senior administration official said.

"We have gone out of our way to avoid an unnecessary legal battle with Mr. Cordray and his actions clearly indicate that he's trying to provoke one," another official said.

The issue will likely be challenged in courts, which could mean "this enormous cloud of uncertainty" hangs over the CFPB in the meantime, said Alan Kaplinsky, who heads the Consumer Financial Services Group for Ballard Spahr LLP.

Kaplinsky said he believes the Dodd-Frank law provides for the deputy director to take charge during a shorter-term leave, but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up.

"I think Trump wins, but unfortunately it is going to take a while," Kaplinsky said. (Reporting by Roberta Rampton in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Susan Thomas)-1
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-buy-walt-disney-company-180000729.htmlBetter Buy: The Walt Disney Company vs. Time WarnerThere are only a handful of major media companies today that control most of the TV and movie content we see. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) are two of the biggest, with properties across the media landscape. That's a powerful position, but it's also tenuous with companies like Netflix and Amazon building their own studios and proliferating streaming content across the world.

With all of the change coming in media, is Disney or Time Warner the better buy long-term (if the AT&T deal falls through)? Here's a look at the companies.

Image of Epcot Center at Disney World. More

Epcot Center in Disney World. Image source: Getty Images.

Where Disney and Time Warner make their money

The first thing to look at is where the money comes from. In fiscal year 2017, Disney generated 43% of its revenue from media networks, 33% from parks and resorts, 15% from studios, and 9% from consumer and interactive products.

Time Warner's business is split into Turner, HBO, and Warner Bros. They generated 40%, 21%, and 43% of total revenues, respectively, in the first nine months of the year, with some inter-segment revenue accounting for the percentages totaling over 100%.

Risks facing media companies are very similar

If you look at the television networks dominating revenue at both companies, you can see where questions may arise about their future. Disney's ESPN is losing viewers every year, as are Turner's networks.

Neither company has a distinct advantage in navigating the future of TV or broadcasting, so that part of the business is kind of a wash. Both are trying to figure out ways to push streaming, like HBO Now from Time Warner and Disney's upcoming streaming service, but there's no easy answer for the network side of the business.

It's this inherant weakness in media where Time Warner sees value in a tie-up with AT&T, which would be able to leverage its distribution network to get the company's content into people's hands. Without AT&T, Time Warner would be on its own navigating new distribution platforms.

Disney's studios have an edge

Where Disney starts to develop an edge over Time Warner is in the studio side of the business. In the past fiscal year, Disney generated $8.3 billion in revenue from studios and $2.4 billion in operating income. Time Warner's Warner Bros. had $9.3 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in operating income in the first three quarters of this year. Time Warner is bigger, but Disney makes more money.

The reason is that Disney has mastered the art of the box office hit. Marvel, Pixar, and Lucasfilm studios consistently produce some of the biggest movies of the year, which generate high margins for Disney.

Disney's biggest differentiators

What Disney has that Time Warner doesn't is the theme parks and resorts. Incredibly, these are the second biggest business segment, making more money than the studios.

Parks and resorts are another way Disney can leverage the characters and brands it builds with media networks and studios, so it's really an added profit center that plugs right into the business.

As media networks go through ups and downs, the theme park business has been more steady, showing 8% growth in fiscal 2017. The segment may be more impacted by other risks, like a recession, but it gives Disney a business that isn't as correlated as the content business.0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/25/irish-prime-minister-leo-varadkar-should-get-grip-brexit-dup-mps-sayIrish prime minister 'should get a grip' on Brexit, DUP MPs sayLeo Varadkar is accused by Democratic Unionists of trying to ‘decouple’ Northern Ireland from rest of UK in Brexit settlement

Two of the 10 Democratic Unionist MPs whose votes keep Theresa May in power have accused the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, of ramping up tensions on the island over his stance on Brexit.

Varadkar’s insistence that Northern Ireland could stay in the single market and the customs union was “unhelpful and obstructive” in terms of the Brexit negotiations, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian.

The DUP leader at Westminster, Nigel Dodds, said Varadkar was “upping the ante” and alienating the unionist community over allegedly trying to “decouple” Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in terms of a Brexit settlement.

Dodds, the MP for Belfast North, said: “You have Leo Varadkar’s minister Simon Coveney standing up in the Dáil last week talking about achieving a united Ireland in his lifetime. You have Leo himself warning that either Britain stays in the customs union and the single market, and if not then Northern Ireland should do so alone.

Q&A Why is Dublin opposed to the idea of a hard border? Show Hide Ireland’s new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has been much more sceptical than the UK about the potential for avoiding border posts via virtual checks on importers. Whilst agreeing with British ministers and EU negotiators that it is inconceivable for there to be a return to a hard border with the north, Dublin argues that the best way for the UK to achieve this would be by permanently remaining in a customs union with the EU and seeking single market membership like Norway through the European Economic Area. The UK has conceded that some of this will be necessary in its interim phase after Brexit, but hopes clever technological solutions can allow it have looser economic links in the long run. Varadkar is not alone in being sceptical about whether such a cake-and-eat-it customs and trade strategy is viable.

“This is about decoupling Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK economy and it won’t work. All it is doing is increasing tensions, which is unfortunate because up to now we have had a very good relationship with the Irish government.”

Dodds added: “He [Varadkar] should get a grip and get real. With all this talk of customs unions and single markets he is in danger of not working on the practical issues with the UK to sort out the border and trade. By going down this road ultimately he is in danger of acting against the republic’s own self-interests [which] rely so much in terms of trade and exports with the UK.”

Ahead of the DUP’s annual conference in Belfast on Saturday, both Dodds and Donaldson predicted that their party’s support for the minority Conservative government would last its full five-year term.

Donaldson said it was “wishful thinking” on the part of Labour to claim the DUP deal to prop up the Tories would fall apart next year.

On the stance of the fragile Irish government ahead of the Brexit summit in Brussels on 14 December, Donaldson claimed Varadkar’s government was being dictated to by Sinn Féin on the European question.

“The Irish government is being very unhelpful in the way they are trying to insist that Northern Ireland remains in the customs union and the single market. What Leo Varadkar has to realise is that the UK is leaving both and that includes the whole of the UK including Northern Ireland,” Donaldson said.

“He is also in danger of a self-fulfilling prophecy about a hard border because while he makes unrealistic demands over the single market and the customs union we are all missing out on hammering out the practical things that can be done to prevent a hard border. Time is running out to do that if he continues to fixate on the single market and the customs union.”

Donaldson said the DUP was opposed to the reimposition of a hard border on the island.

The goodwill Varadkar had generated among the unionist community in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday, when the Irish taoiseach wore a poppy during a Dáil debate, had been lost over his stance towards Northern Ireland and Brexit, Donaldson added.

On the future of the DUP deal that ensures May remains as prime minister, he said: “We need a government that will deliver a good Brexit, which would take up to four years. So by then this government will have served out almost its entire term of office. Conversely, we don’t believe for one moment that Jeremy Corbyn could deliver any kind of Brexit let one a good one for the British people.”

But he said it was irrelevant if the Tories ever chose to replace May as leader.

“The DUP did a deal with the Conservative party, not with any individual,” he said.

The DUP has 10 MPs in the Commons whose votes are crucial in keeping the minority Conservative government in power.

Seven of the eight remaining Northern Ireland Westminster seats are held by Sinn Féin, which boycotts the Commons.0

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is investigating a physical altercation between Jonny Bairstow and Cameron Bancroft that allegedly occurred in a Perth bar earlier this month.

An ECB statement read: “At close of play in Brisbane today, we were made aware of allegations of an incident in Perth four weeks ago. There has been no report of any incident from the venue, security or police and there was no injury reported.

“Following an initial conversation with Jonny Bairstow tonight we understand the context and will follow up with England players and management after the Brisbane Test.”

It’s understood the incident was raised on the field during the Ashes opener in Brisbane when the pair were involved in a heated verbal exchange.

Bairstow and Bancroft crossed paths shortly after England arrived in Australia, where they started their tour with a tune-up at the Waca. Bancroft didn’t play in that game but was at home in Perth before flying out for a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.

There are differing versions of what unfolded. Fox Sports Australia is reporting Bairstow headbutted Bancroft, while other versions suggest it was more low key and a case of tomfoolery gone awry. Cricket Australia (CA) refused to comment.

Bancroft has discussed the matter with team management, who are satisfied he did no wrong. Even if the incident is minor it is unwanted attention for the tourists, who are missing Ben Stokes as police investigate a physical altercation outside a Bristol nightclub involving the all-rounder.

The England coach, Trevor Bayliss, spoke about the prospect of an Ashes curfew following the Stokes incident but decided to give his players free rein, trusting them to enjoy themselves in a sensible manner.

“There are no set curfews, they are just sensible rulings,” Bayliss said earlier this month. “Not drinking between matches is just sensible. We certainly don’t want to keep players in their rooms because it is a long tour. You have to get out and experience what the country you’re touring has to offer. It’s about picking the right time to have a couple of drinks, but knowing to stay away from it if you’re preparing for a match.”

The alleged clash between Bairstow and Bancroft comes four years after a bar-room fight between David Warner and Joe Root preceded an Ashes series in England. Warner was effectively suspended for two Tests after he clipped Root’s chin in a nightclub. Australia’s vice-captain claimed he was angered by Root’s impersonation of Hashim Amla.

CA warned Warner at the time he was on his last chance.-1

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/20/technology/coffee-fuel-bus-london-bio-bean/index.htmlLondon buses are being powered by a new fuel: CoffeeThere's a new buzz powering public buses in London.

British startup bio-bean has partnered with Shell (RDSB) and Argent Energy to create a coffee-based biofuel that will be used in London's diesel buses.

The company has produced 6,000 liters of coffee oil for the pilot project with London's transportation authority -- enough to help power the equivalent of one city bus for a year.

"It's a great example of what can be done when we start to reimagine waste as an untapped resource," bio-bean founder Arthur Kay said in a statement.

The startup collects used coffee grounds from cafes, restaurants and factories, and transports them to its recycling facility. There, the grounds are dried before coffee oil is extracted.

The coffee oil is then blended with other fuels to create B20 biofuel, which can be used in diesel buses without modification.

"Spent coffee grounds are highly calorific and contain valuable compounds, making them an ideal feedstock from which to produce clean fuels," the company says on its website.

Bio-bean estimates that Britain produces 500,000 tonnes of coffee grounds a year, most of which are discarded in landfills where they can emit harmful greenhouse gases.

The company also sells "coffee logs," which are used in fireplaces and stoves as an alternative to wooden logs.

Bio-bean said there is "no formal agreement" to continue using its coffee oil in London, but it hopes to quickly find new markets and applications.

"There is huge potential for this project to expand in the U.S., which drinks the most coffee on the planet, 400 million cups of per day," the company said in a written statement.2

The 60-year-old farmer sat in a worn chair, waiting patiently for customers to buy what he could salvage in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

“There are 68 acres [on my farm] and every single one of them is sown ― well, they were. Now there is nothing,” Cruz told HuffPost, adding that his family depends on what he produces and sells to survive.

In October, when HuffPost visited Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Cruz said he was confident he would receive help from the government, financial assistance to buy seeds and clean up debris. If nothing else, he said, he had at least insured his farm. “But [the company is] not going to pay for everything,” he said. “The loss was too great.”

But when HuffPost reached out to Cruz’s estate last week to follow up on what type of aid he and his family had received, his wife, Limary Perez-Sanchez, 42, said they have not gotten any help from any entity.

Carlos Alberto Flores Ortega, the secretary of the department of agriculture in Puerto Rico, blames limited communication across the island; about a quarter of the island still has no access to telecommunications services. Communicating to farmers on how to get aid has been slow going.

“There’s going to be plenty of people that don’t have all that information because we don’t have telephones and we don’t have internet,” he said, adding that farmers need to visit a government office to make sure they are aware of all the programs and benefits available to them.

Carolina Moreno/HuffPost A plantain farm in San Sebastián, Puerto Rico, at sundown in October.

But more than two months after Hurricane Maria, Flores Ortega says he believes the agricultural sector has “just passed the emergency phase.”

Most of Puerto Rico’s farmers lost much of their livelihood to hurricanes Irma and Maria. Flores Ortega says 80 percent of the crop value on the island was wiped out by the storms. He notes it could take anywhere from 10 months to a year to get back to regular production levels.

For now, some farmers are buying imported goods to stock their businesses.

“I’m going to buy from [abroad] because there is nothing left here,” Cruz told HuffPost, saying he estimates it’ll take almost a year for his plantains, coffee, oranges and more to be ready to harvest. “We have to sell that because there’s nothing else. What am I going to support my family with?”

Assessing The Damage

Financial loss in the agricultural sector is a blow to the already fragile and debt-ridden Puerto Rican economy. Flores Ortega estimates the industry is down $245 million in agricultural products and $1.8 billion in damages to infrastructure ― storage facilities, irrigation systems, fences ― as a result of storm damage.

More specifically, he says, the hurricane destroyed 70 percent of the poultry sector’s facilities, killing about 2.2 million chickens, and the dairy sector had about 4,200 cows either severely affected or killed.

Flores Ortega says all the losses in the agricultural sector mean a delay in his objective to reduce the amount of food that’s being imported to the island from 85 percent to 70 percent. In fact, that number is set to increase as imported goods are the only way farmers like Cruz can keep their fruit and vegetable businesses running while they wait for the next harvest.

While Cruz has not received aid from the government yet, Flores Ortega says farmers are eligible to receive financial assistance from both his department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

In October, the USDA also approved $12 million to provide dairy farmers with money to feed their animals for one month. Farmers must apply to federal programs directly through the USDA, though Flores Ortega says his department is currently helping farmers with the process.

“We have been presenting to the local farmers, in different regional meetings, what those programs are, what those programs require, and what all the documentation is and how to apply for those programs,” he said.

Herds Of Cows Wiped Out By The Storm

While Flores Ortega says the dairy sector is one of the least-affected in the aftermath of the storms, those farmers still felt their losses deeply.

Rubén González Echevarría, 34, is co-owner of a dairy farm in Arecibo, about 43 miles west of San Juan. His brothers Jonathan, 36, and Yamil, 38, also own the farm, which they’ve managed for the past 15 years.

“I prepared the best I could, but the magnitude of the hurricane winds was so strong that they broke everything,” González Echevarría said in mid-October, as he showed HuffPost the sheets of metal roofing that had been destroyed on his farm.

During Hurricane Maria, González Echevarría says 20 of his cows died when zinc roofing fell on them. Five calves died during the storm as well, leaving him with 125 cows for milk production.

While coping with those losses and other effects of the aftermath of Maria, González Echevarría and his brothers still had to milk the cows and dispose of their milk. Blocked roads prevented the company they sell their milk to from picking it up for distribution, but milking had to continue.

“[The cows] are accustomed to being milked twice a day,” he said, explaining how they could develop mastitis or other conditions that could disable future milk production.

Carolina Moreno/HuffPost From left, Yamil, Rubén and Jonathan González Echevarría stand in their dairy farm.

Before the storm, González Echevarría says the farm produced 1,400 liters daily. By mid-October that number stood at 800 liters and is currently at 1,100 liters. The farmer says it’ll take “months” to get back to normal production.

“I know it’s a long process; it’s not instant,” he told HuffPost in a phone call last week. “I have to feel good because what else am I gonna do?”

In the meantime, González Echevarría has been able to take advantage of the USDA’s financial assistance for buying feed for his cows, but he says his month of aid will end on Dec. 7. He also says he received some money that covers 40 to 50 percent of the cost to fix the infrastructure damages to his farm.

“It’s not enough but at least it’s help,” he said. “I need more but until now it’s worked out. Everything is flowing little by little.”

Carolina Moreno/HuffPost The González Echevarría brothers' dairy farm was battered by Hurricane Maria.

González Echevarría, like many other Puerto Ricans across the island, relies on a generator to operate his farm. Flores Ortega says the long-term dependency on generators to run refrigeration tanks for milk and more is a big issue.

“That equipment is not designed for 24/7 hours of operation,” he said. “They are going to be presenting problems if they are not given the correct maintenance. If that happens then they are going to have serious problems.”

Flores Ortega says he plans to ask nonprofits for help with obtaining generators since the USDA does not provide assistance for generators, “because the expectation is that we are not going to have electricity for several months” he added.

Looking To The Future

At 60, Cruz says he’s prepared to deal with the hurricane’s aftermath. He also expects that it won’t be the last time his farm will endure this type of destruction.

“We have to accept all of this because remember what they say, about the [global] warming,” he said. “This won’t be the [last] time that we are going to deal with this. This will keep going. This doesn’t end.”

But Cruz says he wants to keep going because farming is “in you, in your heart, in your faith.”

“We lost the farm but there are others who lost their lives, who lost their houses but we didn’t lose our land,” he said. “We have to get it up and running. We have to keep going. We aren’t going to give up, especially not Puerto Ricans. We are warriors.”-1

“I want to be on the side of right when history writes this story,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said on ABC’s “This Week,” as he repeated his call for Moore to end his candidacy in the Dec. 12 special election.

The allegations that the 70-year-old Moore preyed upon teenage girls while in his 30s “are still very strong and credible, and the denial has been weak,” Scott said.

“It would be best if [Moore] stepped aside,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Scott and Portman are among many GOP lawmakers in Washington, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who have called on Moore to exit the race since the allegations against him first emerged earlier this month.

But Trump continues to stand by Moore and has not ruled out campaigning for him. He all but endorsed him last week, arguing that it would be better to have Moore in the Senate than “a liberal person,” referring to Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.

On Sunday, the president again tweeted that “Liberal Jones would be BAD!” and called him a Democratic “puppet who is WEAK on Crime.”

The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017

Jones is a longtime prosecutor who in 2002 prosecuted two of the KKK members responsible for the 1963 bombing of a black church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four girls.

Moore has denied the sexual misconduct allegations — now from nearly 10 women. Known nationally for his strident opposition to gay marriage, he has said he the accusation stem from a conspiracy to keep him out of the Senate.

Despite their condemnation of Moore, Republican lawmakers on Sunday were reluctant to denounce Trump’s efforts to rally support for Moore.

“The president will have to make his own decisions on where he thinks he is and why he’s there,” Scott said, when asked if Trump is “on the side of wrong.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Trump’s implicit support an attempt “to throw a lifeline to Roy Moore,” but said the decision was “up to the president.”

However, he warned that a Moore victory could have long term negative consequences for Republicans.

“If you think winning with Roy Moore is going to be easy for the Republican Party, you’re mistaken,” Graham said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“The president obviously can speak for himself, and I think he sees the specter of a Democrat holding that seat and what that might mean for his agenda,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) told Fox News’ Chris Wallace.0

No group has claimed responsibility, but Egyptian forces are battling a stubborn Islamic State affiliate in the region, one of the surviving branches of the militant group after it suffered defeats by U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria.

The assault on a mosque has stunned Egyptians, prompting President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government to tighten security at places of worship and key buildings, and call three days of mourning for the bloodiest attack in Egypt’s modern history.

State news agency MENA said the death toll had risen to 305, including 27 children, and 128 people were injured.

Egypt’s public prosecutor’s office, citing interviews with wounded survivors as part of its investigation, linked Islamic State militants, also known as Daesh, to the attack on the Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of El-Arish city.

“The worshippers were taken by surprise by these elements,” the prosecutor said in a statement. “They numbered between 25 and 30, carrying the Daesh flag and took up positions in front of the mosque door and its 12 windows with automatic rifles

The gunmen, some wearing masks and military-style uniforms, had arrived in jeeps, surrounded the mosque and opened fire inside, sending panicked worshippers scrambling over each other to escape the carnage.

Witnesses had said gunmen set off a bomb at the end of Friday prayers and then opened fire as people tried to flee, shooting at ambulances and setting fire to cars to block roads. Images on state media showed bloodied victims and bodies covered in blankets inside the mosque.

“When the shooting began everyone was running, and everyone was bumping into one another,” Magdy Rezk, a wounded survivor, said from his hospital bed. “But I was able to make out masked men wearing military clothing.

UTMOST FORCE

Striking a mosque would be a shift in tactics for the Sinai militants, who have previously attacked troops and police and more recently tried to spread their insurgency to the mainland by hitting Christian churches and pilgrims.

Local sources said some of the worshippers were Sufis, whom groups such as Islamic State consider targets because they revere saints and shrines, which for Islamists is tantamount to idolatry. Islamic State has targeted Sufi and Shi‘ite Muslims in other countries like Iraq.

The jihadists in Egypt’s Sinai have also attacked local tribes and their militias for working with the army and police.

Sisi, a former armed forces commander who supporters see as a bulwark against Islamist militants, promised the “utmost force” against those responsible for Friday’s attack. Security has been a key reason for his supporters to back him, and he is expected to run for re-election next year.-2

Official figures, released at the same time from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are devastating for this government’s claim to economic competence. Growth is down, and is now the lowest of major developed economies in the G7. Productivity growth, the fuel for wider economic growth, is the worst since it has been since the Industrial Revolution. The Institute for Fiscal Studies now talks about two “lost decades” for wages growth, with most people’s living standards not expected to recover until 2022.

The headlines figures are appallingly bad. And, as often with the OBR, much of the devil was in the details in their Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The effects of Brexit are “uncertain” but negative, under this government, who couldn’t provide enough detail on their approach to Brexit for their own forecasters to do their work “on the basis of fully-specified government policy”. A grim little note, on page 99, to the effect that the government’s fiscal position has been improved by “higher mortality rates at older ages than previously assumed”.

What the careful text doesn’t tell you is the human cost behind the figures. Cuts to Universal Credit, still going ahead, that will drive a million more children into poverty over the next five years. Cuts to local authority spending that will leave children’s services on the brink of what charities have called a “catastrophe”.

Austerity has not just failed, but failed so badly that a complete overhaul of government economic policy is now needed. What we got on Thursday instead was a series of sleights of hand from a Chancellor who seemingly cannot match up to the challenges ahead, and is in denial about the emergency in our public services. We needed real change from this government last Thursday: the funding that is being demanded, not by Labour, but by experts and professionals in our health service, our children’s services, and our schools.

What we got instead was an accountancy trick, shuffling Housing Association debt off the government’s balance sheet to flatter the its deficit, merely two years after bringing it on the books. But the housing crisis won’t be solved by financial trickery. It needs real funding and bricks-and-mortar. The £44billion announced for housing with such a fanfare on Thursday lunchtime turned, by Thursday evening, to be just £7billion in actual new funding. Without increasing the supply of housing, as Labour’s own manifesto promised, the cut to stamp duty for first time buyers is little more than a quick way to drive up prices – as the OBR noted. It forecast just 3,500 new buyers to benefit, with the main gainers from the policy being “people who already own property.”-1
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/25/news/black-friday-holiday-shopping-foot-traffic/index.htmlOnline sales boomed on Black FridayBlack Friday 2017 was all about digital sales.

American shoppers spent a record $5 billion in 24 hours. That marks a 16.9% increase in dollars spent online compared with Black Friday 2016, according to data from Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks 80% of online spending at America's 100 largest retail websites.

Digital retail giant Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) said Friday that orders were rolling in "at record levels." More than 200,000 toys were sold in just the first five hours of the day, the company said. Amazon did not provide sales figures for Black Friday.

Meanwhile, malls and big-box retailers were left only slightly emptier.

Early estimates from ShopperTrak, a data analytics company that measures the number of shoppers at stores, said foot traffic "decreased less than one percent when compared to Black Friday 2016."

A meager dip is good news for traditional retailers. As online-savvy businesses continue to gobble up more and more of the market share, companies like Macy's (M), JCPenney (JCP), Gap (GPS) and Sears (SHLD) have suffered.

It remains to be seen exactly how much in-store shoppers were willing to spend. That will be a crucial data point in assessing retailers' woes.

Related: Is this the last Black Friday?

But Brian Field, senior director of advisory services for ShopperTrak, is optimistic.

"There has been a significant amount of debate surrounding the shifting importance of brick-and-mortar retail, and the fact that shopper visits remained intact on Black Friday illustrates that physical retail is still highly relevant and, when done right, profitable," Field said in a statement.

Looking at both Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, however, in-store foot traffic was actually down nearly 2% compared to the same two days last year.

Field says that's likely because "a greater number of brick-and-mortar retailers opted to close on Thanksgiving Day."

We'll know more about how it all shakes out in the coming months and early 2018, when big-box retailers post their next round of earnings reports.

In the meantime, there's plenty of busy holiday shopping days to come.

Adobe predicts that Cyber Monday will be even bigger than Black Friday, bringing in as much as $6 billion in digital sales.0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/26/opinions/fake-news-and-disinformation-opinion-wardle-derakhshan/index.htmlAn asymmetrical war against the pressHossein Derakhshan is a writer and researcher on the socio-political impacts of new media technologies who spent six years in prison in Iran over his blog. They recently co-authored a report, "Information Disorder," commissioned by the Council of Europe. Claire Wardle is a research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, and leads the non-profit First Draft. The opinions in this article belong to the authors.

(CNN) When we use the term "fake news" it is not only self-defeating, it oversimplifies a very complex problem.

A year ago, this wasn't the case. The term actually meant something. It described a particular type of website that used the same design templates as professional news websites but its contents were entirely fabricated.

But earlier this year, the term started to become meaningless. It became used to describe any piece of information that someone else didn't like. Increasingly the term has become weaponized by politicians who use it to undermine independent journalism in an effort to reach the public directly through their own channels.

This is not just a US phenomenon. Research by the Columbia Journalism Review shows that people in three other countries increasingly believe that the "mainstream" media peddle fabricated stories.

In countries where a free press is a luxury and free speech is not guaranteed, this phrase is being as an excuse to clamp down on both. Terminology matters, and using it simply "because everyone else uses it" is no longer good enough.

The term is also woefully inadequate for describing the complexity of the situation. When we think about the Facebook posts created by Russian accounts during the US election, would we consider them news? What about the image of a shark swimming up a Texas highway during Hurricane Harvey? That shark was real , but it was not in Houston during that hurricane.

We live in a time when our information streams are polluted and there are many different types of information. They move and shift. Some types are visible; others are harder to spot. Some we would all agree are problematic -- manipulated images created during a breaking news event, for example, designed to confuse and to hoax. But what about satirical news websites? What about misleading headlines designed solely to drive traffic?

We need to rethink our vocabulary.

In our recent report, " Information Disorder ," commissioned by the Council of Europe and published by Harvard's Shorenstein Center, we proposed three different terms as a way to think and talk about this issue.

Misinformation is when there is an unintentional mistake, such as the poor use of statistics or quotes, or when an old image resurfaces (for example when people shared the shark photo mentioned above).

Disinformation is when false or manipulated information or imagery is deliberately used to do harm to someone. (The Facebook ads created by Russia and targeted at US voters during the presidential election would be an example of this).

Malinformation is when genuine information is used to cause harm to someone (for example revenge porn).

Rumors, conspiracy theories and fabricated information are nothing new. As Sun Tzu explained 25 centuries ago, "all warfare is based on deception." False information is a part of our lives, whether it is individuals lying to save face or prevent hurt feelings, politicians making unrealistic promises during election campaigns, corporations using false claims to damage their competitors or the media disseminating misleading stories to gain a wider audience.

However, social media has added an entirely new dimension to the phenomenon, most significantly because the power dynamics have changed. Now anyone in the world can easily create and disseminate false information, and with the help of bots, organized groups, or targeted ads, it is easy to amplify it.

Given how social media have made our information consumption a public performance for our audience, it is now even less likely for most people to swim against the tide and challenge each other. In our increasingly lonely lives, who would want to feel lonelier?

Recent revelations about foreign meddling in the US elections have exposed the fact that we're targets in an active information war. Previously these types of campaigns were fought via sophisticated and expensive communication technologies, such as short-wave radio or transnational satellite television.

Now significantly less powerful agents can harm large institutions or established individuals with few resources. It is asymmetrical warfare.

There are two new and unique aspects of social media which have changed the game: Firstly, disinformation can be cheaply amplified through committed volunteers, paid agents or bots. Secondly, our information sources are becoming increasingly social, and therefore much more visual, emotional, and performative. And as trust in institutions decreases, people are turning to their closest networks of family and friends for information.

This has created a perfect environment for the spread of disinformation around the world.

There are significant and long-term concerns. Social media has become the most powerful vehicle for politicians around the world to undermine traditional media, thereby damaging the very foundation of the idea of representative democracy: informed voters.

The combination of social media and television is a hotbed for sensational politicians who benefit from populations polarized by political, economic, religious, racial or ethnic divisions.

Sophisticated methods -- especially the use of micro-targeted advertising via social media -- must be considered as a recipe for electoral success around the world.

So what can be done? The truth is that there are no easy solutions. These trends are the symptoms of significant social and economic shifts globally. But ultimately, it is only logic and critical thinking which could save us from the trap of manipulation.-1

China's premier has arrived in Hungary to participate in a summit with 16 countries from central and eastern Europe.

Li Keqiang was met by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban upon his arrival at Budapest's main airport on Sunday afternoon.

China's "new Silk Road" initiative of ports, railways and roads to expand trade across Asia, Africa and Europe is expected to be one of the themes of the "16+1" summit.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Sunday that China and the 16 countries at the summit would sign 23 cooperation agreements, while Hungary on Monday will publish the public procurement tenders for the reconstruction of the railway line between Budapest and Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.

http://www.businessinsider.com/fed-official-turnover-is-high-raising-uncertainty-policy-risks-2017-11Nearly all of the Fed board is up for grabs and that's creating a risk Wall Street isn't thinking aboutFederal Reserve turnover is unusually high, with four seats on the central bank's board still awaiting presidential nominations.

Many market participants welcome Jerome Powell, the new chair, as having market experience and signaling a degree of policy continuity with outgoing chair Janet Yellen.

There are also fears, however, that the dwindling number of economics PhDs at the highest levels could hamper interest rate policy in coming years.



Wall Street is becoming a little too certain about the future path of US interest rates.

Markets welcomed President Donald Trump’s nomination of Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen at the central bank’s helm as a sign of likely policy continuity. In the short-run, it probably is.

But beneath the surface, an unusual level of turnover at the highest levels of Fed staff could have a considerable effect on the policy outlook, and even the way policymakers communicate with markets and the public.

The whopping stock market rally that began in March 2009 and continues to set records was built on large part in confidence in the Federal Reserve — its swift response to the financial crisis under the stewardship of Great Depression scholar Ben Bernanke, and the ongoing support of a low interest rate policy under Yellen.

But the future of Fed personnel is now uncertain. Trump still has four open board governor seats he could nominate, although he has been especially slow about filling the ranks of presidential appointees. At the same time, the influential New York Fed president post is up for grabs after William Dudley announced his early resignation, and the presidency of the Richmond Fed is also open after the prior president resigned in April due to a leak scandal.

All these changes could have big, if incremental, implications for financial markets, which have been counting on policy continuity from the Fed under Powell.

Powell, who unlike many of his predecessors is trained in law rather than economics, brings lots of financial market and policy experience to the job, having spent much of his career at the private equity firm Carlyle Group. He has now been on the Fed’s board as a governor since 2012, and was previously a Treasury official under George W. Bush.

"Different people have different areas of strength — what matters is the composition and quality of the FOMC as a group," David Andolfatto, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Business Insider.

The Fed is facing key decisions in the coming months and years, including whether to continue raising interest rates in an economy that has performed robustly but unspectacularly. Officials are torn between a historically low 4.1% jobless rate, which suggests underlying strength, and an inflation rate that continues to undershoot the official 2% target, which suggests on the other hand that the economy is actually operating below its full potential.

The recent spate of high turnover leaves open questions about how the Fed will handle those big decisions. Michael Pearce, US economist at Capital Economics, worries that a lack of economic expertise in the broader ranks of the FOMC "raises the risk of miscommunication or even a major policy mistake."

In particular, Pearce wrote in a research note to clients that the number of FOMC participants with economics PhDs "peaked at 16 in 2003 and may fall to just half that by early next year."

Yellen’s announcement that she will step down as board governor after Trump failed to reappoint her as Fed chair leaves "Lael Brainard as the sole member of the Board with advanced training in economics," Pearce said.

"As far as we can tell, that would be unprecedented and at odds with other major central banks."

The average tenure of the regional Fed presidents fell steadily over the 2000s, Pearce added, and resignations at the board have accelerated that trend.

"The average FOMC participant has spent less than four years in the position, half of what the average tenure was fifteen years ago," he writes, offering the following chart to illustrate the point.

Indeed, Goldman Sachs economists recently estimated this may be the biggest year of turnover for the Fed going as far back as 1936.

"A less qualified and experienced FOMC doesn’t affect the immediate outlook for policy," Pearce concluded. "But it does mean that the big questions will fall increasingly to the Fed staff rather than FOMC members themselves."-1

On evenings before I travel, it is my custom to set out the following day’s clothes on my bedroom chair. I do this in tandem with packing my suitcase, attending as much to the details of my travel costume as to the items being curated for use later in the trip. This is a useful habit for more than one reason: When I wake and must dash to some inconveniently located transit hub, I won’t need to make any snap decisions. And I can also thoughtfully incorporate the various elements of my travel-day outfit into the larger set of options I’ve brought along for the ride—these chinos will pair nicely with a different shirt, and those dressier shoes will come in handy when that friend takes me out for dinner later in the week.

J. Bryan Lowder J. Bryan Lowder is a Slate associate editor and the editor of Outward. He covers life, culture, and LGBTQ issues.

However, the primary reason I make the extra effort to plan my travel outfit is because, well, no one else does. Among the cavalcade of pajama pants, tracksuits, nightgowns, painting rags, and ill-fitting sweatshirts that one encounters in the world’s terminals and stations these days, the competently dressed individual stands apart as a beacon of civilized life, an island of class amid a swamp of schlumps. By dressing myself as a decent human being who is aware that he is in public, I like to think I am performing a small act of resistance against the increasingly slobbish status quo.

Having just faced this onslaught of sartorial neglect yet again on an overseas trip, I’m pleading with you: Join me. Dress decently when you travel. Seven hours to Madrid in la clase turista is trying enough without your mangy old T-shirt adding to the sensory assault.

Now, before I’m accused of elitism, understand that I am not calling for a three-piece suit on every JetBlue hop or Megabus jaunt (though that would not have been abnormal mere decades ago), nor do I mean to dictate what you should wear within the tinted confines of your own car. I am simply suggesting that, when traveling by public means, each of us dress “nicely” or “respectably” according to our means. I certainly don’t have the funds for a dedicated travel ensemble, but I can manage to pull together an attractive trouser, a pressed shirt, close-toed shoes, and perhaps even a light sport coat or cardigan—the kind of thing I generally wear to work—with little effort or expense.

The competently dressed individual stands apart as a beacon of civilized life, an island of class amid a swamp of schlumps.

Sure, you say, but why bother dressing up (I’d say not dressing down) for a trip? Allow me to begin with a few practical considerations. As I say, it is wise to wear some of the clothes you’d like to have access to again while in transit. It saves room in your luggage, and you don’t plan on wearing that jogging suit when you’re out in the “real world” of your destination anyway, right? Why drag it along in the first place? Plus, unless you are flying in an un-air-conditioned cabin nonstop from L.A. to Sydney, you can probably wear your clothes again (perhaps with a brief dewrinkling in the shower steam) before needing to wash them.

Also, a number of coworkers and friends have observed to me that dressing decently seems to garner superior treatment from transit staff. Combine that preferential treatment with any goodwill garnered via “The Kindly Brontosaurus” maneuver, and you are liable to end up sipping cocktails just behind the cockpit with a well-heeled new friend simply by taking basic care for your appearance. And guess what? When you and your new friend arrive at your destination, you needn’t extinguish the sparkle of the conversation in order to go change into something becoming at the hotel. Simply freshen up in the airport bathroom and head right out to take a coffee or a drink, as your arrival time dictates.

If those sorts of practical and social perks don’t appeal, consider the emotional benefits of dressing well while betwixt and between—and no, I’m not (just) talking about feeling superior to the hoi polloi. As everyone knows, travel these days can be practically barbaric: Space is cramped, in-flight meals are lackluster, and premiums are charged for everything from checking bags to watching TV to munching snacks. The weary traveler has little control over these things, but he can control his own outfit—and feeling handsome amid all the inhumanities can be powerfully heartening. What’s more, traveling, despite its continuing degradation, should be exciting—it’s a special occasion! Just as you might buy yourself an in-flight cocktail or a frivolous magazine at the concourse newsstand to brighten the experience, you should wear flattering clothes as a small way of marking travel as a singular experience.

Alas, the general lack of respect for travel, itself, as a worthwhile human experience, seems to be the root of this lazy dressing phenomenon. Many of us act as if we’re trying to create a private, instantaneous bridge through folded space-time between our bedrooms and our hotel rooms by flying in our pajamas or busing behind oversized sunglasses; the bad news is, barring a sudden forward leap in technology, wormhole creation is impossible.

What is possible, though, is embracing travel as a process, one that offers its own pleasures as well as trials. And foremost among the former is an opportunity to share public space. In fact, traveling—especially air travel—may be the occasion when many of us are most in public, most engaged in negotiating the commons. Americans are, of course, fond of their personal space, but public travel requires that we recognize that airplanes, trains, and buses are not extensions of our living rooms. Just because we may be anonymous does not mean we are invisible.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/best-viral-photos-and-optical-illusions-2017-1011 cleverly Photoshopped photos that went viral and stumped the internetSomething weird is going on with the cover for Ariana Grande's album "My Everything." Grande's second record had a cover of her sitting on a stool. But something's off.

There's no way she could sit on a stool like that. As many other people have pointed out, there's no way Grande could be sitting on a stool in the way she appears to be on the album cover. Comedian-writer Jesse McLaren even attempted to recreate the pose, inspiring other failed attempts. A promotional image for Grande's single "Focus" also seemed off. One of her hands looked disproportionately large.

Kendall Jenner seems to be happily hanging out with Hailey Baldwin and Kylie, right? InStyle magazine's Instagram photo of the three models hanging out together after the Golden Globes went viral for a reason, though.

Kendall's leg went missing. What might make you do a double-take is that Kendall's leg seems to be gone. Some eagle-eyed viewers noticed that the leg just seems to be missing because of the strange way Kendall twister her body. Because of the way her torso is facing the viewer, you expect her legs to be facing directly forward. In fact, they're twisted to her right. You can see the top of her "missing" leg under her dress if you look closely.

Just six Green Bay Packers fans enjoying the big game, right? This photo went viral on Reddit in late 2016. It looks relatively innocuous, right? Just six women on a couch?

Once again, a leg seems to be missing. As many people noticed, while the photo has six women, there seem to be only 10 legs. A closer look reveals what's really going on. The woman sitting in the middle is leaning her torso to her left and her head to the right. The legs to her right are actually hers. On the end of the couch, the woman's legs are also clear. She's wearing black jeans. The woman between them is also wearing black jeans. One of her legs is totally hidden behind the legs of the person at the end of the couch. You can see some of her other leg more easily if you adjust the photo's lighting. See? They all have legs.

Beyoncé, as the meme goes, is flawless.

But someone did Photoshop work on her thigh gap for this photo from her website. It's not the first time that the singer has been accused of manipulating her thigh gap in pictures.

Hundreds of thousands of people struggled to figure out what's off about this photo. There's something amiss in the photo, which went viral on Imgur after it was uploaded by a user going by the name of what047. But not everyone can spot it.

Everyone in the background has the same face. If you look at the people in the background instead of the women's faces, you'll notice that everyone has been photoshopped to have the same head of a man looking down.

Does this photo look like anything special to you? The photo went viral when U.K. resident Arron Bevin posted it to Facebook. He said it took him "a good 5 minutes" to figure it out. Most people just see a brick wall at first.

Check out the cigar. A closer look reveals a cigar wedged between the bricks, lining up with the wall's shadows.

Babies shouldn't be holding knives, right? This seems like a bad idea.

Don't worry, it's Photoshopped. It's part of a series of photoshopped pictures from Stephen Crowley, who edited photos to make it look like his daughter is in dangerous situations. He did it to troll his relatives. Since the images went viral, he's used them to draw attention to the bone marrow registry. His daughter, Hannah, suffers from a condition that required a bone marrow transplant when she was less than a year old.

There's a reason Lindsay Lohan deleted this Instagram post. "My feet look red lol — had to take that out. Only real red is my hair," she wrote in her now-deleted Instagram post.

Looks like someone did some Photoshop work. As the curving wall indicates, it looks like the photos were altered to exaggerate certain features.

Here's a hint: something similar is going on with this Kylie Jenner photo. She takes a lot of selfies. What makes this one distinct?

Some weird curtain curving indicates more digital editing. Jenner defending the photo, saying her curtain (and, I guess, the wall it hangs next to) naturally bends toward her body.

This is one of Taylor Swift's most famous Instagram photos. In it, she's hanging out with the band Haim on a boat.

But fans noticed something was amiss. The guardrail behind them curves a little bit, indicating Photoshop work.

This girl looks like she might be underwater. When this photo was posted to Reddit in 2015, a debate raged over whether she was underwater. But there's are clues that reveals the truth.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/college-football-playoff-teams-are-in-2017-11Chaos hits college football and at least 6 teams still control their own destiny to make the playoffChaos is here as both No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Miami lost with one week to go.

There are at least six teams that still control their own destiny depending on who wins the conference championship games.

Alabama does not appear to be one of the teams and now needs help.



There is just one week to go before the announcement of this season's College Football Playoff teams and thanks to some upsets, the chaos that so many fans desire is here.

Both No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Miami lost this week, sending the playoff rankings into a spinning mess. We still don't know how far those teams will fall, but a quick scan of the teams still standing suggests that at least six teams still control their own destiny to get in.

Here are the teams that should be in the playoff if they win their respective conference championship games next weekend:

Clemson.

Clemson rebounded well from their loss to Syracuse and will likely ascend back to the No. 1 spot in the rankings this week. It became clear in recent weeks that the committee was giving Clemson a pass for the loss, possibly because starting quarterback Kelly Bryant was injured and possibly because the game was on the road and Clemson has won other tough games on the road this season.

Whatever the reason, one-loss Clemson will likely be No. 1 and will be in the playoff if they beat Miami in the ACC title game. If Clemson loses, all bets are off.

Oklahoma.

Like Clemson, OU rebounded well from their mid-season loss to an Iowa State team that turned out to be better than most thought at the time. OU struggled the following week against Texas, but has rattled off six straight wins since then by an average score of 49-28.

The Sooners and their Heisman-favorite quarterback, Baker Mayfield, could be as high as No. 2 this week and will be in the playoff if they win their rematch against TCU in the Big 12 title game. Oklahoma won the previous meeting 38-20, in Norman. If OU loses, they are out.

Auburn.

A lot of people thought it was crazy when people pointed out that two-loss Auburn was still alive for the playoff a month ago. But since then, they have taken down the No. 1 team in the country twice, in beating Georgia and then Alabama, on Saturday.

The Tigers now get a rematch against Georgia in the SEC championship game. Auburn will be ranked among the top four this week and a win will make them the first two-loss playoff team. A loss and they are out.

Wisconsin.

There were questions about Wisconsin's schedule earlier in the year, and it is still not great. But they have added wins over Iowa and Michigan and blown out everybody else, including Minnesota, 31-0, on Saturday. While other teams in contention have lost to teams like Syracuse, Iowa State, and LSU, whenever the Badgers play teams like that, all they do is win.

Wisconsin should finally get into the top four this week, possibly at No. 4. But even if they don't, they will be at No. 5 with either two ACC teams in front of them or two SEC teams. In either of those scenarios, a top-four team will lose next weekend or won't be playing (if Alabama is still in the top four). Either way, Wisconsin will jump into the top four with a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten title game.

Miami.

Miami played with fire all season long and they finally got burned. Luckily for them, their blemish, an ugly loss to Pitt on the road, came after big wins over Virginia Tech and Notre Dame. Those wins should still be fresh in the minds of the committee.

Look for Miami to be sixth this week, behind Alabama, but still in contention. If they can take down likely No. 1 Clemson next week, that should be enough to vault them back into the top four, ahead of idle Alabama and the team they would have beaten, Clemson.

Georgia.

The Bulldogs are the big mystery team here. The fell from No. 1 all the way to No. 7 after a loss to Auburn. But now Auburn looks like one of the best teams in college football and that is still Georgia's only loss.

It is hard to imagine Georgia leap-frogging undefeated Wisconsin, but they could be anywhere from fifth to seventh, depending on how the committee views the losses by Alabama and Miami. Those three teams are probably fairly interchangeable at this point. But even if Georgia is still No. 7, they should still get into the playoff if they are SEC champs. They would jump ahead of Auburn, idle Alabama (who would have the same loss to Auburn and no conference championship), and the loser of the ACC title game, who would have two losses.

The teams that need help.

There are some big names in this group, and none are bigger than Alabama. The idea of a 1-loss Alabama team missing the playoff would have seemed absurd earlier in the season. But it is hard to imagine a scenario now where they get in without some help.

Bama's best shot at this point would be for the committee to keep them in the top four this week. More likely, they will be fifth or sixth and would need at least one upset in a conference championship game — certainly possible — and for the committee to take two teams from the SEC — less possible.

Ohio State would also seem to still be on life support, despite having two ugly losses and likely not being ranked higher than No. 8 this week. They need help, but a convincing win over Wisconsin in the Big Ten title game would at least get them into the conversation.

USC and TCU still have shots to win their conferences and be two-loss teams in consideration. TCU would seem to have the better chance of the two as they would add a win over a top-four Oklahoma team to their resume while USC is facing Stanford. The biggest problem for USC and TCU is that there are too many teams ahead of them playing either other.-1
http://uk.businessinsider.com/coco-justice-league-thanksgiving-box-office-winner-2017-11Pixar's 'Coco' tops 'Justice League' to win the Thanksgiving weekend box officeDisney/Pixar dominated the Thanksgiving holiday weekend at the multiplex once again.

"Pixar" won the long holiday weekend with an estimated $72 million.

The animated movie knocked off "Justice League," which took in $60 million to come in second place.



Pixar and Disney Animated Studios have dominated the Thanksgiving holiday weekend over the past handful of years, giving us titles like "Frozen," "Moana," "The Good Dinosaur," and "Tangled." Now you can add Pixar's latest "Coco" to that list.

The emotional look at a boy's journey to the Land of the Dead to better understand his family and celebrate his relatives who have passed away took in a solid $49 million over the weekend and $72 million total over the five-day holiday weekend domestically, according to Exhibitor Relations.

To put that in perspective with the Disney/Pixar Thanksgiving domestic releases of the past, that opening is better than "The Good Dinosaur" ($39.1 million three-day / $55.4 million five-day) and "Tangled" ($48.7 million / $68.7 million) but didn't perform as well as "Moana" ($56.6 million / $82 million), "Frozen" ($67.4 million / $93.9 million), or "Toy Story 2" ($57.4 million / $80.5 million).

"Coco" took in $8.9 million on Thanksgiving day with an audience that was 39% Hispanic over the weekend — a strong number that Disney/Pixar was striving for.

Warner Bros.'s "Justice League" dropped down to second place with $60 million over the five days. The $300 million-budgeted superhero blockbuster now has a weak domestic total of $171 million.

"Wonder" continued its surprising run for Lionsgate by taking in $32 million over five days to win third place.

But audiences didn't show up for Denzel Washington's latest, "Roman J. Israel, Esq.," as the Sony drama only earned $6 million over the five days on over 1,600 screens.0
http://www.businessinsider.com/9-things-you-should-know-but-real-estate-agents-wont-tell-you-2017-119 things you should know but real estate agents won't tell youIf you're planning to sell or buy a home, there are some key things you should know before hiring a real estate agent.

You don't always need a real estate agent to sell your home, but if you do hire one, commission is usually negotiable.

Big agencies aren't always better — sometimes the smaller ones are more likely to negotiate and provide better customer service.

You should also know that inspectors might not tell you everything about the home you're interested in buying.



In 2016, close to 5.5 million homes — including single-family dwellings, townhouses, and condos — were sold across the country. In nearly 90% of those transactions, the buyer, the seller, or both used a real estate agent. In fact, just 8% of the houses sold in 2016 were for sale by owner (FSBO).

So if you're planning a move, you're probably also planning to hire a real estate agent. Before you do, there are a few key things you need to know that agents may not want to tell you.

1. You don't need to hire a real estate agent to sell your house

If you're willing to research pricing and can take great pictures, you can have great success selling your home yourself. If the housing market is hot, you may not even have to do anything other than invest in a "for sale" sign and sort through the offers that come flooding in.

For most FSBO listings, you'll need to get your house onto the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), which is the big database buyers and agents use to find homes for sale. Flat-fee services such as FSBO or US Realty allow you to get your house listed on the MLS without a real estate agent, but you'll need to offer a commission for the buyer's agents.

If you're selling a house yourself, know what it's worth. Underpricing it means leaving money on the table, but a home priced too high may never sell. Even if you lower the price later, you won't reach as many potential buyers, since you'll miss that new-home buzz.

2. You can avoid a commission if you bring your own buyer

So you're signing your contract with a seller's agent tomorrow, and your neighbor's friend or cousin's boss has already taken a look at the place. Once you sign the contract, if the boss makes an offer, you'll have to go through your agent, right?

Not so fast. Before you sign with the agent, disclose in writing any legitimate potential buyers who've already expressed interest. If a disclosed buyer decides to complete the purchase, you don't have to go through the broker — or pay the broker's commission.

3. Commission is almost always negotiable

Sellers pay commissions to both their own agent and the buyer's agent. The accepted industry standard is a 6% commission, split between the two agents. But just because each agent wants 3% doesn't mean each should get it. In fact, more than 80% of sales are closed without the seller's paying 6% in today's marketplace.

When hiring an agent to sell your home, you may be able to negotiate a lower fee just by asking, especially if you're willing to use the same agent both to sell your current home and to buy your next one. Negotiating is often easier on higher-priced homes. And if Redfin is in your market, it offers an effective 4.5% commission and rebates part of the commission to buyers.

Sellers should have a discussion about commission before signing a contract and should let a preferred agent know if a better deal is on offer to see if the agent will match it. If a buyer is interested in a home but the buyer and seller are a few thousand dollars apart on price, agents involved in the transaction may also be willing to discount their commission to make a deal.

4. That open house — it's not for you

You know the open house you spent all day cleaning for so your house would be pristine? It probably didn't make any difference in attracting buyers or selling your home.

Just 9% of buyers in 2014 found the homes they purchased through a yard sign or open house, and this number is declining as more buyers turn to the internet to find homes.

So why do agents host open houses? Most of the time, visitors consist of neighbors or people casually looking. Real estate agents can hand out their cards and drum up new business for themselves, using your house as the backdrop for their own marketing efforts.

5. Small agencies can be just as good as big ones

Big real estate agencies have brand recognition and substantial marketing budgets, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're the best or only option.

Big agencies are typically less willing to negotiate on commission than small ones, and agents may get a smaller share of commission, giving them less incentive to work hard to sell for the highest price. Agents at big agencies may also be under a lot of pressure to meet sales goals, which means they may be stretched too thin to give your home the attention it deserves.

A smaller boutique agency sometimes provides better customer service — and the internet has leveled the playing field so that many small agents can market your home just as effectively as big ones. The key is to not be blinded by brand names and to interview several agents to find one you feel good about — but also to make sure any agent from a small brokerage is a qualified full-time real estate agent if you go that route.

Seven in 10 buyers and and 74% of sellers only contacted one agent about their transaction in 2016, which means the majority may have missed out on finding an agent who was the perfect fit. Interview agents from brokers big and small, and compare marketing plans to find the best agent for you.

6. Your home inspector might not tell you everything

Most homebuyers rightly insist on a pre-sale examination by a licensed home inspector of any house they're looking to buy. However, the Internet is full of inspectors claiming they've been pressured by agents not to be too thorough in the inspection process.

Many inspectors learn quickly that if they want to be hired, they can't afford to alarm buyers by listing every problem. Worse, some unscrupulous agents may partner with inspectors they know will overlook big problems and raise only little issues.

If you're buying a home, research independently to find a highly rated inspector whom you can count on to bring up termite problems, that speck of mold in the attic, or other serious issues that could affect your desire to buy.

7. The contract you're signing has some fine print

Real estate brokers generally provide the contracts for buyers and sellers involved in a transaction. If your contract is coming from your broker, look carefully for a disclaimer of promises. This disclaimer may state that you're going through with the sale as a buyer without any reliance on verbal statements from real estate agents or sellers. Of course, in reality, you have little else to rely on.

To make sure your contract doesn't involve a waiver of rights — and that it contains clauses to protect you — consider hiring a lawyer to look over the agreement. Your home is probably your biggest investment, so paying a small fee to ensure a fair contract is worth it.

8. Getting the best price may not always be the top goal

Real estate agents get paid more if your house sells for more, so they'll work hard to get the best price — right?

Maybe. But if an agent can sell your home in a month at a lower price point and move on to the next transaction, it may not be worth his or her effort to spend a few extra months on marketing and showings just to boost your bottom line. Agents may also prefer higher volume, even at the expense of price, because of the risk that transactions could fall apart.

Agents may even behave unscrupulously by bringing you an offer from an unrepresented buyer and "forgetting" a competitive bid that came in from a buyer's agent. While an agent could lose his or her license for such a misdeed, discovering the unreported offer can be difficult and there are agents willing to take the risk if they can double their commission.

9. Buyers and sellers can check for misconduct

Real estate agents must be licensed and should provide their license number. You should check with the state to determine if an agent has been disciplined for any misconduct.

In New York, for example, there's a searchable online database where you can input an agent's license number, or search by name, city, or county. Most states have similar search features, and you should absolutely check the record of any agent you're thinking about hiring. Choosing an agent without a record means reducing the chances of bad advice — or of a problem like an agent who doesn't bring all your offers.

Find the right agent — if you plan to hire one at all

While real estate agents undoubtedly have industry secrets, that doesn't mean all agents are bad. FSBO homes tend to sell more quickly, but they often sell at lower prices than homes sold with an agent's help.

To decide if you need an agent, consider whether you're willing to put in the extra time and effort to research prices, list or find homes yourself, and figure out how to close the transaction without professional help.

If you're not eager to navigate the world of FSBO real estate transactions on your own, research your agent carefully to find someone who will look out for your interests in one of the biggest transactions of your lifetime.0

Posting screenshots from Wikipedia and pictures of the little girl, she said that, like Maddie, she had a brown spot on her iris, The Sun reported.

She told her friends: “Right guys. I don’t usually believe in conspiracy theories but honestly I think I’m Madeleine McCann.”

One responded: “I f***ing give up.”

She then posted a picture of her eye and leg calling them “Exhibit A” and “Exhibit B”.

Another friend responded with several crying emojis before Harriet, from Manchester, added: “I’m Madeleine McCann and I don’t know what to do with myself.”

Screenshots of the group chat were posted on Twitter by her friend Elizabeth with the caption, “Close the door am out”.

More than 100,000 people have liked the post but there is a strong reason to suspect the student might not be the person she claims.

Brookes told The Tab that she “just sent it for a joke”.

“I’m loving reading people’s reactions. I feel like so many people are taking it seriously,” she said.

Maddie disappeared while on a family holiday in Portugal in 2007 when she was just three-years-old.

http://nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.htmlMilitants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt’s Deadliest Terrorist AttackThe attack started midday during Friday Prayers when a bomb — probably set off by a suicide bomber, security officials said — ripped through Al Rawda mosque in Bir al-Abed, 125 miles northeast of Cairo. As worshipers fled, they were confronted by masked gunmen who, witnesses said, had pulled up outside in five four-wheel-drive vehicles.

The gunmen set fire to cars parked outside the mosque to hinder escape, and opened fire on ambulances as they arrived on the scene, a government official said on state television.

Mayna Nasser, 40, who was shot twice in the shoulder, drifted in and out of consciousness as he was rushed to a hospital. “My children were there; my children were there,” he said, according to Samy, a volunteer emergency worker who drove him there and who declined to give his last name.

Local emergency services were so overwhelmed that some of the wounded had to be transported to the hospital in the back of a cattle truck, he said.

Many were taken to the general hospital in the main northern Sinai town of El Arish, where medics described chaotic scenes as staff struggled to deal with a flood of dead and wounded, many with extensive burns or severed limbs.

“We are swamped,” said one medical official, speaking by phone on condition of anonymity. “We don’t know what to say. This is insane.”

Other victims, like Mohammed Abdel Salam, a 22-year-old construction worker, ended up in a hospital in the nearby city of Ismailia. “I wish I never stopped to pray,” he said. “I’m not even a Sufi. I was just there by accident.”

Until a spate of attacks on Christian churches this year, Egyptian militants had avoided large-scale assaults on Egyptian civilians, perhaps because such attacks tend to backfire. After a massacre in Luxor that killed 62 people, mostly tourists, in 1997, President Hosni Mubarak began a sweeping crackdown that crushed an Islamist insurgency centered in southern Egypt.

When a new insurgency flared in north Sinai after the military takeover in 2013, its leaders were careful to focus their attacks on uniformed security forces. But as those militants embraced the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, they have gradually set aside that lesson.

An Islamist militia in Sinai, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 and has since proved to be one of its most effective local affiliates. The group’s deadliest attack targeted a Russian jetliner that crashed shortly after takeoff from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015, killing all 224 people on board.

In an interview published in an Islamic State magazine last January, a commander in Sinai outlined the group’s hatred for Sufis and their practices, including the veneration of tombs, the sacrificial slaughter of animals and what he termed “sorcery and soothsaying.”

The interview, in English, identifies Rawda, the district where Friday’s attack occurred, as one of three areas where Sufis live in Sinai that the group intended to “eradicate.”

It featured a photograph of a black hooded figure brandishing a sword over the kneeling figure of an elderly Sufi cleric, Sulayman Abu Hiraz, who was executed in Sinai in late 2016. The Islamic State said the cleric, said to be 100 years old, had been killed for practicing witchcraft.

Many residents of Bir al-Abed, on the main road through northern Sinai, are Bedouins from the Abu Greir tribe, which is predominantly Sufi. Residents said that despite recent Islamic State threats, the town had been largely peaceful.

The Islamic State, a Sunni movement, has long considered Sufis, along with Shiite Muslims, apostates, and has a history of attacking their mosques in other countries. Sufis may be Sunni or Shiite but most are Sunni.

Since 2016, when the militant group released a video describing Sufism as a “disease,” it has claimed attacks that have killed at least 130 worshipers at Sufi shrines, most of them in Pakistan. Elsewhere, the Islamic State has made a spectacle of bulldozing Sufi shrines, describing their removal as a form of purifying the faith.

Egyptian security forces have closely monitored Islamic State fighters returning from Syria and Iraq, amid worries that an influx of battle-hardened jihadis could insert a volatile new element into Egypt’s militant mix.

In October, Mr. Sisi ordered a major reshuffle of his security team after an ambush in the desert left at least 16 Egyptian security officials dead. That attack was later claimed by a previously unknown group called Ansar al-Islam, which is believed to have links to Al Qaeda.

Friday’s attack was a blow to Egypt’s hopes that it could stem the tide of Islamist violence in Sinai through the government’s sponsorship of a Palestinian peace initiative involving Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.

Islamic State militants have previously used tunnels into Gaza to obtain weapons and get medical treatment for wounded fighters. One benefit for Egypt of the peace initiative, which Egypt’s General Intelligence Directorate has mediated, is greater control over those tunnels.

In a statement, Hamas denounced the attack as a “criminal explosion” that “violates all heavenly commandments and human values” because it attacked a mosque. “It is a grave challenge to Muslims worldwide,” the group said.-2
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/26/world/americas/peru-climate-change.htmlIn Peru’s Deserts, Melting Glaciers Are a Godsend (Until They’re Gone)Throughout the 20th century, enormous government development projects, from Australia to Africa, have diverted water to arid land. Much of Southern California was dry scrubland until canals brought water, inciting a storm of land speculation and growth — a time known as the “Water Wars” depicted in the 1974 film “Chinatown.”

Yet climate change now threatens some of these ambitious undertakings, reducing lakes, diminishing aquifers and shrinking glaciers that feed crops. Here in Peru, the government irrigated the desert and turned it into farmland through an $825 million project that, in a few decades, could be under serious threat.

“We’re talking about the disappearance of frozen water towers that have supported vast populations,” said Jeffrey Bury, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz who has spent years studying the effects of glacier melt on Peruvian agriculture. “That is the big picture question related to climate change right now.”

A changing climate has long haunted Peru. One past civilization, the Moche people, built cities in the same deserts, only to collapse more than a millennium ago after the Pacific Ocean warmed, killing fish and causing flash floods, many archaeologists contend.

Now dwindling water is the threat. While more than half of Peru sits in the wet Amazon basin, few of its people ever settled there. Most inhabit the dry northern coast, cut off from most rain by the Andes range. While the region includes the capital, Lima, and 60 percent of Peruvians, it holds only 2 percent of the country’s water supply.

The glaciers are the source of water for much of the coast during Peru’s dry season, which extends from May to September. But the icecap of the Cordillera Blanca, long a supply of water for the Chavimochic irrigation project, has shrunk by 40 percent since 1970 and is retreating at an ever-faster rate. It is currently receding by about 30 feet a year, scientists say.

Farmers along the 100-mile watershed that winds its way from the snowcapped peaks to the desert dunes say they are already feeling the effects of the change.

The retreat of the icecap has exposed tracts of heavy metals, like lead and cadmium, that were locked under the glaciers for thousands of years, scientists say. They are now leaking into the ground water supply, turning entire streams red, killing livestock and crops, and making the water undrinkable.0

In a somewhat different vein, the Baylor professor Alan Jacobs responded to a question (from me) about where younger evangelical intellectual life is going by saying that “as far as I can tell, where young evangelicals are headed is simply out of evangelicalism.” Meaning that they will either go along with the drift of their elders and become church-of-American-greatness heretics, or else they will return to “older liturgical traditions,” Catholic and Orthodox and Anglican, and cease to identify with evangelicalism entirely.

I don’t know exactly what to make of these predictions. American evangelicalism has always contained a number of different tendencies: It’s home to rigorous heirs of the Reformation, seeker-sensitive megachurches, would-be ecumenical “mere Christians,” prosperity preachers and hard-edged Christian nationalists.

During the 2016 Republican primary, it was easy enough to argue that Trump was exploiting these divisions, winning Fox News-watching cultural evangelicals and prosperity-gospel types while losing churchgoers who cared about character and orthodoxy.

Then in the general election it was possible to argue that the latter groups only came around to Trump reluctantly, out of fear of contemporary liberalism’s anticlerical streak, and that their relationship to his identitarian nationalism was transactional and didn’t reflect any deep congruence.

If this is right, then the alienation of younger evangelical writers from Trumpism’s court pastors could indeed be a signifier of a coming evangelical crackup. In this scenario the label itself would become contested, with the kind of winsome and multiethnic evangelicalism envisioned by the anti-Trump Southern Baptist Russell Moore pitted against the nationalist evangelicalism of a Jerry Falwell Jr. or Robert Jeffress, and churches along the fault line internally embattled and dividing.

But it’s also possible that evangelical intellectuals and writers, and their friends in other Christian traditions, have overestimated how much a serious theology has ever mattered to evangelicalism’s sociological success. It could be that the Trump-era crisis of the evangelical mind is a parochial phenomenon, confined to theologians and academics and pundits and a few outlier congregations — and that it is this group, not the cultural Christians who voted enthusiastically for Trump, who represent the real evangelical penumbra, which could float away and leave evangelicalism less intellectual, more partisan, more racially segregated ... but as a cultural phenomenon, not all that greatly changed.

If so, then this would imply that white Christian tribalism and a very American sort of heresy, not a commitment to scripture and tradition, has kept evangelical churches thriving all these years. And if the God-and-country, pray-and-grow-rich tendencies sweep aside orthodox resistance, the evangelicalism that emerges might be more coherent and sociologically resilient, in the short run, for being rid of hand-wringers who don’t think Baptist choirs should set “Make America Great Again” to music.

This is a sobering idea, and one I hope is wrong.

But it is a paradox of this strange time that serious evangelicals should probably be rooting for a real post-Trump crisis in their churches — because its absence will tell them something depressing about where their movement’s strength lay all along.-1

Betting on price swings in oil costs the least in three years before next week’s OPEC meeting. Implied volatility of options on second-month West Texas Intermediate futures sank to 20.94 percent Friday, the lowest level since October 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volatility has been sinking as futures move steadily higher, with prices reaching $59 a barrel for the first time in more than two years.

This week’s cheap options may prove a good deal, if the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting next week brings any surprises that send prices gyrating. The organization and Russia are said to have agreed on the framework of an extension of the oil supply cuts beyond March. But there still are details to be hammered out.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/zimbabwe-activists-fear-post-mugabe-human-rights-crackdown-mnangagwaZimbabwe activists fear post-Mugabe human rights crackdownConcerns grow over track record of new president Mnangagwa, who has been accused of involvement in 1980s killings

Activists and human rights campaigners in Zimbabwe fear a new crackdown that could roll back gains made during the eight-day crisis that culminated in the resignation of President Robert Mugabe last week.

Relatives of victims of state-sponsored violence said they were concerned about the track record of the new leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was Mugabe’s righthand man and is blamed for the brutal suppression of political opposition parties during elections in 2008.

Profile Who is Emmerson Mnangagwa? Show Hide Emmerson Mnangagwa was Zimbabwe's powerful vice-president until 6 November, when he was fired by Robert Mugabe. The 75-year-old former intelligence chief had been locked in a battle with the first lady, Grace Mugabe, to succeed her husband as president. In October she publicly denied poisoning him after he fell ill at a rally in August. After his sacking, which was seen as an attempt to clear Grace Mugabe's path to power, Mnangagwa fled to South Africa. He reportedly returned on 14 November as the military prepared to take over the country, and is firm favourite to become Zimbabwe's next leader. He has strong support within the security establishment and among veterans of Zimbabwe’s 1970s guerrilla war, when he earned the nickname “the crocodile”. Despite allegations about his role in atrocities in the 1980s, much of the international community has long seen him as being the most likely figure in Zimbabwe to guarantee a stable transition and implement economic reforms.

“Just because [Mnangagwa] has wrestled power from the devil does not mean I see him as the messiah,” said Patson Dzamara, whose activist brother Itai was abducted in 2015 and has not been heard of since.

“So many have been killed, maimed, tortured or imprisoned, and the ones who are presiding over this transition are the ones responsible.” he added.

Mugabe, whose 37-year rule over the impoverished southern African country was marked by brutal repression, stepped down after a military takeover led to mass protests and impeachment proceedings in parliament.

In his inauguration speech in a packed national stadium in Harare on Friday, Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old stalwart of the ruling Zanu-PF party, said he would govern for all “patriotic Zimbabweans” and promised elections would be held as scheduled next year.

He did not mention lifting restrictions on freedom of expression, or any measures to weaken the grip of the feared internal security services he helped set up following Zimbabwe’s independence from white-minority rule in 1980.

The new president was minister of justice when Itai Dzamara was pushed into a vehicle by unknown men, and has been accused of involvement in the killings of more than 20,000 civilians in the south of Zimbabwe in the 1980s.

Q&A What might happen next for Robert Mugabe? Show Hide Robert Mugabe planned for everything, except his own retirement. He outsmarted his rivals and blindsided his allies for decades, and so most of the country had come to accept that he would stay in office until the day he died. Emmerson Mnangagwa, now expected to take over from him, had boasted in May that Mugabe would die in the job. As such, there was no planning for the future.

One of the biggest questions now will be whether Mugabe can stay in Zimbabwe. Few ousted autocrats are allowed to stay on in the countries they once ruled, due to fears they may resuscitate their careers or become figureheads for opposition.

Mugabe may be an exception, because of his age and his role at the heart of Zimbabwe’s long liberation struggle. Throughout the most unusual of coups, Mugabe appears to have been treated with extreme deference by the generals holding him prisoner. Party members who ended his career have paid tribute to his historical achievements. His much-hated wife, dubbed Gucci Grace for her spendthrift habits, may be targeted. But Mugabe is unlikely to want to face retirement alone, and any deal is expected to include protections for Grace and their children. Wherever they end up, the Mugabes will certainly not lack for pension funds. By some estimates he holds about £1bn of assets, including vast property holdings and businesses around the country. Much of his wealth has also been invested outside Zimbabwe.



Mnangagwa denies any responsibility, saying he was head of internal security at the time and not in the military, which carried out the massacres.

In his inauguration speech, he called on Zimbabweans to “let bygones be bygones”.

There are concerns that Mnangagwa, despite describing Zimbabwe as an “unfolding democracy”, may prove as intolerant of protest as his predecessor.

On Monday, a high court judgment is expected on subversion charges brought against Magamba, an award-winning satirical online network, social media activist centre and creative hub raided by police hours before the military takeover 13 days ago. Laptop and desktop computers confiscated by police have yet to be returned.

“How they deal with this [case] is a litmus test for the new government. It will be a signal to any activist who uses social media … about what you can and can’t say in this supposedly new Zimbabwe,” said Samm Farai Monro, Zimbabwe’s best-known political satirist, comedian and creative director of Magamba.

The network had repeatedly incurred the wrath of authorities with an irreverent and immensely popular weekly show.

The raid came after attempts by authorities to close its offices in Harare for alleged planning permission infringements failed. Martha O’Donovan, a US citizen who was an activist working with the network, was arrested last month on charges of subversion and undermining the authority of the president and will appear again in court in two weeks.

The fall of Mugabe, 93, was triggered by a factional battle within the ruling party over his succession. Within days of the military takeover, thousands of ordinary people were on the streets, waving placards and chanting slogans against the ageing autocrat in scenes unthinkable under his rule. In one massive protest more than 100,000 people marched through Harare.

“The military turned on the tap to allow a one-off big demonstration but the citizens’ momentum has to stay on. We are fighting not just to keep that space open but to radically expand that space that we need as citizens to make the new Zimbabwe a free country,” Monro, 37, said.

Human rights activists in Harare say that more than 400 people have been detained since the military took power. These include hundreds of security officials loyal to Mugabe, as well as former finance minister Ignatius Chombo. Only a handful have been charged with any offence.

Chombo appeared in court on Saturday in leg irons to face corruption charges after more than week in military custody.

The whereabouts of several other prominent supporters of Grace Mugabe, the former president’s 52-year-old wife, are unknown. It was the first lady’s bid to cement her hold on power through the sacking of Mnangagwa on 6 November that led to her husband’s fall.

The sudden events pose creative challenges to activists and satirists, too. “Now that Bob [Mugabe] is gone we have to work tirelessly on new Emmerson [Mnangagwa] jokes but they’ll definitely be coming very soon in the next show,” said Monro.-1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/spaniards-face-ham-shortage-as-chinese-market-gets-taste-for-jamon-ibericoSpaniards face ham shortage as Chinese market gets taste for jamón ibéricoIberian ham has become the latest sought-after luxury from the west in China, but demand is outstripping supply

Having discovered the joys of French wine, caviar and truffles, China’s new rich are turning to a new gourmet delicacy to satisfy their demand for luxury goods from the west: Spain’s jamón ibérico, or Iberian ham. But demand is now threatening to outstrip supply, leaving Spaniards facing steep price rises in their most prized Christmas delicacy.

The recent lifting of import restrictions has allowed top-of-the-range ham to find its “rightful place in the market, alongside caviar and truffles”, René Lemée, the head of exports for the famous Cinco Jotas brand, told El País newspaper.

The Chinese, pork lovers par excellence, have now been seduced by jamón ibérico. The problem is that the best ham takes years to produce and, as demand outstrips supply, it is pushing up the price by as much as 10%. A 7.5kg leg sells at between €150 and €600 (£135-£540).

Spanish ham comes in many forms, but to be defined as jamón ibérico de bellota (acorn-fed Iberian ham), which is what the Chinese want, it must first come from Iberian blackfoot pigs, or from 50% crossbreeds. These pigs must then spend several months of the year roaming the dehesa, a pasture planted with oaks, feeding on grass and acorns. During the last few months before being slaughtered they must live exclusively on this diet.

Not only are there relatively small areas of dehesa – mostly in north-west and western Spain – but each pig needs about two hectares (five acres) to fulfil its needs. Once slaughtered, the animals’ legs are plunged into vats of salt and hung and dry-cured over a range of temperatures for a minimum of 36 months, with the best hams cured for about 48 months.

“It’s inevitable that the price in Spain is going to rise,” said Roberto Batres, the director of Shanghai de Delaiberia Gold, which exports ham, wine and olive oil to China. “The companies licenced to trade in China don’t have enough jamón de bellota to meet Chinese demand.”

World's most expensive ham? Read more

In an effort to meet demand the Chinese have started importing raw frozen pork from Iberian pigs and curing the meat themselves, although Batres says the product is excessively salty.

The production and consumption of top-quality ham is the subject of the same awe and mystery as the making of fine wine. Cutting de-boned jamón de bellota on a ham-slicing machine is regarded as sacrilege. The leg must be bolted on to a frame called a jamonero and then cut by hand using a long, narrow blade.

http://time.com/5037259/nancy-pelosi-john-conyers-congress-sexual-harassment/?xid=homepageNancy Pelosi Declines to Say If Rep. Conyers Should ResignHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declined to say whether her longtime colleague Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) should resign from the chamber as he faces sexual harassment allegations.

“We are strengthened by due process. Just because someone is accused — was it one accusation or is it two? … John Conyers is an icon in our country. He has done a great deal to protect women,” Pelosi told Chuck Todd Sunday on NBC News’ Meet the Press. “As John reviews his case, I believe he will do the right thing.”

The House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into Conyers’ conduct following a report that he had sexually harassed a former staffer. Pelosi was among the Democrats to call for that investigation and Conyers said he would fully cooperate.

Conyers announced shortly after Pelosi’s interview Sunday that he was stepping down from his position as ranking chairman of the House Judiciary Committee while the ethics committee investigates his conduct. In a statement following that announcement, Pelosi said that the power of a legacy should not undermine the legitimacy of sexual harassment claims. “Zero tolerance means consequences,” she said.

Buzzfeed reported on Nov. 20 that Conyers had reached a settlement that exceeded $27,000 with a former staffer who alleged that the congressman had sexually harassed her and she was fired because she rejected his advances.The following day, Buzzfeed reported that another of Conyers’ former staffers had tried to sue him for making sexual overtures toward her and creating a hostile work environment, but the former staffer withdrew the claim when the court would not let the complaint remain sealed.

Conyers, 88, denied the first reported allegation, although he acknowledged that a settlement had existed. Regarding the second allegation, a spokesperson for Conyers’ office told TIME that the former staffer had decided to drop the case.

While on Meet the Press. Pelosi did not respond directly when asked if she believed Conyers’ accusers. “I don’t know who they are. They have not really come forward,” she said.

When pressed again, she replied that the review was under the jurisdiction of the House Ethics Committee.

Pelosi did however say that the nondisclosure agreements that are part of the settlement cases need to be reformed.

“We want to give people hope this is going to be addressed. Women have spoken out,” she said.0

John Conyers wore boxers or briefs, according to a former key staffer, who said the embattled Michigan lawmaker once called her into a meeting while sporting only his skivvies.

Melanie Sloan, a lawyer who worked with Conyers on the House Judiciary Committee, said she was called up to the long-serving congressman's office to discuss an issue only to find him “walking around in his underwear.”

Sloan is the third woman to accuse Conyers of inappropriate behavior.

“It made me increasingly anxious and depressed about going to work every day,” she said, adding that “there was no way to fix it.”

“It made me increasingly anxious and depressed about going to work every day." - Melanie Sloan

“There was no mechanism I could use, no person I could go to,” she said.

Sloan was a well-known Washington lawyer when she worked as Democratic counsel on the House Judiciary Committee in the 1990s. It was not clear exactly when the strange encounter with the lawmaker, now 88, occurred.

During her time working for the committee, she claims Conyers often screamed at her, fired her then re-hired her, criticized her for not wearing stockings and once even ordered her to babysit one of his children.

While those revelations came out earlier this week, word of Conyers, who was first elected to Congress in 1964, taking a meeting in his underwear came this week in a Detroit Free Press article.

Though Sloan maintains Conyers did not sexually assault her, she told the Detroit Free Press that “his constant stream of abuse was difficult to handle and it was certainly damaging to my self-respect and self-esteem.”

Conyers’ hometown newspaper earlier this week called for his resignation in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him as well as a questionable payout to one alleged victim.

Conyers is accused of using taxpayer dollars to settle a claim in secret, after a former staff reportedly claimed she was fired for rejecting his advances.

In a scathing editorial published late Tuesday, the Detroit Free Press demanded the Democrat step down immediately.

The paper called Conyers' actions “the kind of behavior that can never be tolerated in a public official, much less an elected representative of the people.”

“He should resign his position and allow the investigation into his behavior to unfold without the threat that it would render him, and the people he now represents, effectively voiceless,” the board wrote.

BuzzFeed reported Monday that Conyers settled a wrongful termination complaint in 2015 with a staffer who claimed she was dismissed because she did not “succumb to [his] sexual advances.”

Conyers acknowledged in a statement that his office paid his accuser the money -- reportedly a $27,000 sum -- but “vehemently” denied the underlying claims.

“I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me, and continue to do so,” Conyers, who has spent 53 years in Congress, said. “My office resolved the allegations – with an express denial of liability – to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative.”

But the Detroit Free Press, which described Conyers as an “undisputed hero of the civil rights movement,” took issue with how Conyers’ office chose to handle the issue.

After the alleged victim made a formal complaint through Congress' Office of Compliance, Conyers’ office reportedly pushed to handle the situation on its own. If the woman dropped her complaint, signed a legal document saying Conyers had done nothing wrong and promised not to make any additional claims against him, she would be re-hired as a temporary “no-show” employee and paid $27,111.75 for three months, according to reports. The accuser agreed to the terms.

Conyers’ office defended the agreement as a way to avoid litigation – though House ethics rules bar lawmakers from keeping an employee on the payroll who isn’t doing anything.

"A House member can’t retain an employee who isn’t performing work commensurate with the pay, and regardless, can’t give back pay for work that stretches further than a month," the editorial board wrote.

While acknowledging that payoffs happen in the private sector, the board said “it should never, ever happen where public dollars (and public accountability) are concerned.”

Calling it a “public betrayal,” the board wrote it’s impossible to know how often the practice takes places in Congress but added Conyers should have known better.

Even though resigning would end his otherwise “stellar career,” the paper wrote that it’s “the appropriate consequence for the stunning subterfuge his office has indulged here, and a needed warning to other members of Congress that this can never be tolerated.”

The House Ethics Committee announced Tuesday it has opened an investigation into the matter.-1

The victim was several hundred yards offshore Friday at Pebble Beach when the shark bit him in the right thigh, state fire Capt. Josh Silveira said. The man was with his father at the time.

Two off-duty deputies who had been out fishing helped rescue the bleeding man.

One of the deputies was trained in emergency field medicine and applied a tourniquet to the man’s leg “stopping his massive blood loss,” the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. The man was taken to a trauma center for surgery.

Silveira said the man’s leg was still intact but the bite was serious. There was no word on his condition Sunday.

There hadn’t been any recent shark sightings in the area, but the beach was tagged with warning signs after the attack.

Police officers flying over the water in a helicopter also spotted a “large aquatic animal off Pescadero Point, which may have been a shark,” according to the Mercury News.

In March, a great white shark knocked a kayaker off his boat as he was paddling through Monterey Bay. The kayaker wasn’t bitten.

A Jack in the Box worker, Twitter user @franco_713, shared a video of himself pouring soda between three different-sized soda cups at the fast food chain last Sunday.

The point franco_713 was trying to make was that each size cup all held the same amount of liquid.

Twitter skeptics immediately pointed out that the inside of the cups were not shown before the liquid was poured in. While others defended the magic trick, believing they had been duped all this time by ordering large drinks that carried the same amount of soda in a small.

The tweet went viral with over 77,000 retweets and 126,000 likes.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/21/melania-trump-son-barron-receive-white-house-christmas-tree.htmlMelania Trump, son Barron receive White House Christmas treeWASHINGTON -- Melania Trump and son Barron joined in a time-honored tradition of receiving the official White House Christmas tree, which will become the showstopper for a president who has vowed to put Christmas back at the center of the winter holidays.

A military quartet played holiday tunes Monday as a horse-drawn wagon carried the 19 1/2-foot (5.9-meter) Balsam fir from Wisconsin up the White House driveway.

The first lady, wearing a red turtleneck and a coat draped over her shoulders, and 11-year-old Barron, in a dark suit coat, white shirt and dark slacks, circled the tree and then visited with growers Jim and Diane Chapman. The Chapmans own a Wisconsin Christmas tree farm and won an annual contest sponsored by the National Christmas Tree Association.

"This is a beautiful tree. Thank you so much. We will decorate it very nicely," the first lady told the Chapmans and other family members. "I hope you can come and visit with us."

The White House grounds superintendent and the chief usher, who oversees the residence, picked out the tree during a September scouting trip.

After Mrs. Trump and Barron gave their symbolic approval, the tree was carefully carted off to the Blue Room where, after a slight trim and the removal of a monstrous chandelier, it will take center stage.

President Donald Trump has been eagerly waiting to celebrate a Trump Christmas at the White House. During last year's presidential campaign, he railed against the habit of saying "Happy holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas," characterizing it as a "chipping away at Christianity."

"And we're not going to let that happen anymore, folks. I'll tell you," the then-candidate said at a March 2016 news conference in Florida. "A lot of times I'll say at the rallies around Christmastime we're going to start saying Merry Christmas again. You know, they don't say it anymore. The department stores don't put it up. We're going to start saying it again."

Invitations to dozens of holiday parties hosted by the Trumps are going out. The subject line of one emailed invite references a White House "Christmas reception" while the language of the invitation itself refers to a "holiday reception."

The tree for the Blue Room usually arrives the day after Thanksgiving, but it was delivered early this year to accommodate the Trumps, who are spending the holiday at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.

While the Trumps are away, a small army of volunteer decorators and florists from around the country will descend on the White House on Friday and spend the holiday weekend transforming the 132-room mansion for Christmas, complete with a tree in every public room.

The White House kitchens will go into overdrive preparing all the food and cakes, cookies and pies that are typically served at the parties, along with the gingerbread White House -- which, for health reasons, is never eaten. In recent years, cookies in the image of former President Barack Obama's dogs Bo and Sunny were always among the first items to be slipped into purses for the trip home.

Trump does not have a pet.

The White House plans to unveil the holiday decor on Monday, and the first lady will also welcome children and students from Joint Base Andrews for a holiday arts and crafts event. The president plans to light the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse on Thursday.1

14 years later, it’s difficult to imagine anyone from “Lord of the Rings” being recast for Amazon’s upcoming TV series. Even among the likes of Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, one character feels especially linked to his performer: Gollum, née Sméagol. Andy Serkis brought motion-capture acting to new heights with his take on J.R.R. Tolkien’s most tragic figure, but the actor-turned-director says he shan’t be returning to Middle Earth anytime soon.

“I don’t think I actually would at this point in time,” Serkis tells the Toronto Sun when asked about reprising his role. “I feel like I’ve been part of Middle-Earth for a long period of time in my life and it was a great experience, but I can’t foresee that.” Sad news, Precious.

It’s understandable, though — Serkis has been busy with the likes of “War for the Planet of the Apes” and next month’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” not to mention directing Andrew Garfield and Claire Foy in “Breathe.” He’s also taken on an unofficial role as mo-cap acting’s best-known advocate and ambassador.

“In some ways, it’s not considered acting and it absolutely is,” he says. “There’s no question about it. I never draw a distinction between playing a live-action character and a motion-capture role.” Read his full interview here.0
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/26/franken-will-not-resign-but-embarrassed-and-ashamed-over-misconduct-allegations.htmlFranken will not resign, but 'embarrassed and ashamed' over misconduct allegationsSen. Al Franken broke his silence Sunday on sexual misconduct allegations, reportedly saying he’s “embarrassed and ashamed” but will not resign from the Senate.

“I've let a lot of people down and I'm hoping I can make it up to them and gradually regain their trust," Franken, a two-term Democratic Minnesota senator, told the Star Tribune of Minnesota.

Franken spoke to Minnesota news media eight days after the first allegations surfaced. He reportedly plans to also do interviews with Minnesota radio stations Sunday.

Four women have publicly said Franken groped them, including one who said he forcibly kissed her.

"I'm looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow," Franken, on Congress’ week-long Thanksgiving break, also said in the phone interview with the newspaper.

The first claim against Franken emerged nearly two weeks ago, when Leeann Tweeden, a Los Angeles radio host, said the senator forcibly kissed and groped her during a 2006 USO tour, before he was elected to the Senate.

She said Franken kissed her while rehearsing a sketch. And later on the tour, Franken was photographed with his hands over Tweeden’s breasts, grinning at the camera, as she slept.

A second allegation was reported Monday. Lindsay Menz told CNN that Franken grabbed her buttocks in 2010 when they posed together for a picture at a Minnesota state fair, while he was a senator.

Two other women have since anonymously reported such incidents to the Huffington Post. One woman said Franken groped her in 2007, during a photo at the Minnesota Women's Political Caucus. The other said he cupped her backside with his hand in 2008 and suggested that they go to the bathroom together at a Democratic fundraiser in Minneapolis.

Franken’s office said last weekend that the senator will not resign, amid calls for him to step down.

The senator has repeatedly apologized to Tweeden. He also said he feels badly that Menz felt “disrespected” but that he does not remember the photograph being taken.

Franken has said he has posed for "tens of thousands of photos" over the years but does not remember any in which he cupped a women's backside, as several women have alleged.

The senator also told the newspaper on Sunday that he has spent the past week "thinking about how that could happen and I just recognize that I need to be more careful and a lot more sensitive in these situations."

He said he didn’t expect such allegations would follow the first one. “I certainly hope not,” he said about the possibility of similar allegations surfacing.-1
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/26/america-have-it-good-blessings-and-gratitude-this-thanksgiving-season.htmlAmerica, we have it good - blessings and gratitude this Thanksgiving seasonIt was my first trip to Amsterdam, having landed at the Schiphol airport after an all-night flight from New York. Boarding an early-morning train to the Rai convention center, I was already tired, though it would be many hours before I would have the opportunity to sleep. It was Amsterdam 2000, a conference for evangelists hosted by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

Some 10,000 evangelists and Christian workers were there from more than 100 nations. We would spend more than a week learning about ministry and recommitting ourselves to Christ’s Great Commission. I was one of the few American attendees who had opted to lodge at Jaarbeurs, rather than in one of the expensive hotels in downtown Amsterdam. Signing up months prior, it wasn’t hard to choose to stay at this much-more-economical place.

At the end of my first day, hundreds packed into trains for a 40-minute ride out of the city of Amsterdam to our place of lodging. I anticipated getting a shower and lying down for my first real sleep in more than 24 hours. The trains were jammed with men who didn’t look, sound or smell like anything I was used to. Though they were fellow ministers—brothers in Christ, for sure—culture shock was creeping up on me.

Shock fully set in when I arrived at Jaarbeurs, part heavy-equipment warehouse and a sort of steel behemoth that doubled as an exhibition hall. It was so large inside you could barely see from one end to the other, with a floor partly paved and partly dirt. It had been fitted with nearly 8,000 steel cots to accommodate the most basic sleep needs of evangelists from every corner of the globe. There were 400 temporary showers, very spartan, and with long lines of men waiting. I did not get to bathe until my third day! By that time, a shower was indeed a resurrection of sorts.

I reflected on the surreal experience of seeing one humble servant shed tears of gratitude for bread, cheese, water and a cot—living arrangements that were “unacceptable” to me.

The Jaarbeurs warehouse had become the largest men’s dorm in Amsterdam, complete with all the noises, odors and lack of decorum you might imagine. The only thing scarcer than privacy was hot water—and I was going to spend 10 days there. Following a map on the long walk to my sleeping area, I discovered my “room” to be a steel cot, adjacent to countless others. Lying atop its wafer-thin mattress was a small loaf of bread, a block of cheese, and several bottles of water. Exhausted, unshaven and wondering where to store my luggage, I thought, “Why didn’t I spring for a hotel?”

Not far away was a sloped, trough-type device approximately 80 feet long with water dribbling into one end from a suspended tube. This was a “lavatory.” As the wait for a shower would be hours-long, I joined others at the makeshift sink who were brushing teeth, scraping tongues, gargling and spitting. Wanting to score a mouthful of water to rinse with, I leaned over toward a dangling spigot. Inches below my face, the trough conveyed a river of saliva, toothpaste foam and grey-brown backwash that gently oozed by. My mouth accidently gulped its aroma and I fought back nausea. What really made my stomach churn was that one confused conference attendee—clothed in rags and coming from who-knows-where—bent down and washed his face in the trough’s gooey “water.”

Then and there I resolved to return to Amsterdam and rent myself an actual hotel room, no matter the cost. But arriving back at my cot, I was stopped in my tracks. At the bed next to mine stood a short, bearded man, wrapped shoulders-to-ankles in a type of toga that stopped about 6 inches above his sandaled feet. He was holding his loaf of bread with outstretched arms, staring at it. The man slowly picked up the block of cheese from his bed and gazed down at it. He rotated it around, staring at the cheese the way a careful jeweler might examine a diamond. Bottles of water were knocked to the floor as the man suddenly fell against the cot, weeping. Though his language contained only bits of English, through this man’s sobbing I could hear the words, “Thank you, Jesus! Thank you!” He almost panted, “Jesus, I praise You for this … bounty.”

Conviction fell over me. I backed away quietly. Turning around, I came upon a conference assistant who kindly offered to help me find where I was supposed to go. We quietly talked about the scene I had just witnessed. He explained, “Most of these men are Christian workers who’ve come from developing nations, third-world countries or regions of terrorism and civil war.” I reflected on the surreal experience of seeing one humble servant shed tears of gratitude for bread, cheese, water and a cot—living arrangements that were “unacceptable” to me. The man said, “Alex, for many of these brothers, the accommodations here will be some of the best they will experience for their entire life.”

I never left for a hotel. Instead, I felt unworthy to bunk among these holy men of God. While I groused about having to brush my teeth over a trough, these men were bursting with joy to have a week of Bible training—for many, the only formal theological training they would ever receive.

So, what might this have to do with Thanksgiving 2017?

The rigors of Amsterdam 2000 were one of the first times my sense of American entitlement was stunted by exposure to other cultures. It certainly wouldn’t be the last. Since then I have been to other parts of the world that would make that Netherland warehouse look like a fine hotel. But here is my point: In America, we have it good.

Our infrastructure is reliable, our gasoline is cheap, our food is affordable, and the choices endless. We should be thankful that America is a nation whose backbone was¾and largely still is¾the family.

Americans enjoy amenities that people from other eras would have fainted over—hot water on demand, the ability to maintain personal hygiene, smartphones, paved roads, hospitals and backyards not roaming with dangerous animals. We are blessed to be a nation of over 300,000 churches, and we still enjoy the ability to freely broadcast Christian content via the airwaves and online. America was founded on Christian principles. In our country, problems may be addressed with peaceful elections without violent revolutions.

Regarding the proliferation of churches throughout the colonies, Thomas Paine in 1776 said, “Where, say some is the King of America? I’ll tell you, friend, He reigns above!” As God has uniquely blessed America, it is only prudent to consider how to keep America in this position. We do not deserve God’s hand of blessing. But this Thanksgiving season, let’s be grateful for it and humble enough to pray, realizing that the sins of this nation are causing His hand of blessing to be removed.1

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/26/media/house-of-cards-crew-hiatus/index.html'House of Cards' crew members still in limbo"House of Cards" is still in limbo.

The show's production company, Media Rights Capital, told crew members in an email Sunday that the show will remain on hiatus for the next two weeks. It is investigating allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey, the star and an executive producer of the Netflix hit.

"These last two months have tested and tried all of us in ways none of us could have foreseen," wrote Pauline Micelli, MRC's senior vice president of business and legal affairs for television. "The one thing we have learned throughout this process is that this production is bigger than just one person and we could not be more proud to be associated with one of the most loyal and talented production cast and crews in this business."

The email was provided to CNNMoney by a spokesperson for the company.

Staffers will continue to be paid during the hiatus, according to the email. The show's writers and a small group of office and accounting staff are working in the production office. Other cast and union members who aren't actively working will be paid according to union guidelines.

Related: The end of 'House of Cards' would hammer Baltimore and wipe out 2,000 jobs

Production on the sixth and final season of "House of Cards" was halted after Spacey was first accused of sexual misconduct in October. The actor, Anthony Rapp, told BuzzFeed that Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in 1986 when Rapp was 14.

CNNMoney later reported on allegations of sexual harassment and assault made by current and former "House of Cards" employees against Spacey.

After that report was published, Netflix said it would not be involved with the show if Spacey had any part in its future. MRC suspended Spacey pending its investigation.

Sources close to the production told CNNMoney earlier this month that it is unlikely the show will be canceled, and that writers are discussing how to rewrite the show without its biggest star.

There's a lot at stake. Killing the show could wipe out more than 2,000 jobs and hurt Baltimore, where the show has been filmed for the past five seasons.

MRC told crew members that it will update them again by December 8.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/al-franken-sexual-misconduct-groping-allegations/Franken embarrassed, ashamed amid groping allegationsFranken embarrassed, ashamed amid groping allegations

MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Sen. Al Franken broke his silence Sunday after being swept into a nationwide tide of sexual harassment allegations, saying he feels “embarrassed and ashamed” but looks forward to returning to work on Monday to gradually regain voters’ trust.

Franken spoke to the Minneapolis Star Tribune after largely being silent since four women publicly accused him of misconduct. Three of them said the Democrat grabbed their buttocks while taking photos with them during campaign events. Franken told the newspaper he doesn’t remember the photographs but that such behavior is “not something I would intentionally do.”

Asked whether he expected any other women to step forward with similar allegations, Franken said: “If you had asked me two weeks ago, ‘Would any woman say I had treated her with disrespect?’ I would have said no. So this has just caught me by surprise . . . I certainly hope not.”

Franken also agreed to speak with other Minnesota media outlets on Sunday. His staff didn’t respond to repeated interview requests from The Associated Press.

The first woman to come forward was Los Angeles radio news anchor Leeann Tweeden, who earlier this month released a photograph of the former comedian grinning while reaching out as if to grope her as she slept on a military aircraft during a USO tour in 2006. Tweeden said Franken also forcibly kissed her while rehearsing for a USO performance, which Franken has disputed.

A few days later, Lindsay Menz publicly alleged that Franken pulled her in closely and squeezed her buttocks while they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. Two other women, speaking anonymously to The Huffington Post, said last week that Franken grabbed their buttocks during political events in 2007 and 2008, during his first campaign for Senate.

One woman said the Democratic candidate suggested they visit the bathroom together. Franken has denied propositioning a woman to go to the bathroom and said it was “difficult to respond to anonymous accusers.”

On Sunday, he said he has posed for “tens of thousands of photos” over the years and doesn’t remember any that ended with his hand sliding down to cup women’s backsides.

“I don’t remember these photographs, I don’t,” he said. “This is not something I would intentionally do.”

Franken has walked a careful line in his response to the allegations. He earlier apologized to any woman who felt disrespected from their encounters.

Franken faces a Senate ethics investigation — which he welcomed in the wake of Tweeden’s allegation — though it’s unclear when that review may begin. A swirl of sexual harassment allegations at the Minnesota Capitol forced the resignations of two state lawmakers at party leaders’ urging, but Franken hasn’t faced similar widespread calls to leave his U.S. Senate seat.

Franken came to the Senate after a months-long recount gave him a 312-vote victory in his 2008 election. He immediately tried to distance himself from his decades of professional comedy, which included off-color jokes about rape and disparaging women, and avoided national reporters.

Dozens of women who’ve worked with Franken, including former Senate staffers and women who worked with him on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” signed statements supporting Franken following Tweeden’s allegations.-1

If you're feeling inspired by the film, here are five causes to shout about.

Well, King did just that, and the match (nicknamed 'the battle of the sexes') paved the way for women's professional sport to be taken more seriously.

In response, former tennis player Bobby Riggs, 55, - who famously won all three Wimbledon events (singles, doubles, mixed doubles) in 1939 - challenged her to a televised match, in an attempt to prove that no woman could beat him.

For those uninitiated, in 1973 King co-founded the Women's Tennis Association after becoming sick and tired of the disparity between prize money for men and women. At the age of 29, she'd recently won her fifth of her six Wimbledon singles titles.

This season Emma Stone will transform into legendary tennis player Billie Jean King for her latest film 'Battle Of The Sexes' - and it's guaranteed to give you a feminist sporting awakening.

TV Coverage

In 2017 more women's sport has been shown on TV than ever before, but the coverage still pales in comparison to the men's.

While in 2016 you could catch every single match in the men's UEFA Euro 2016 tournament on terrestrial TV, this year you could only catch the England and Scotland games of the UEFA Women's Euro on telly. If you wanted to watch any extra fixtures, searching for obscure links online was the only option.

Kate Dale, who heads up Sport England's This Girl Can campaign, says equal sports coverage "matters for many reasons".

"We want girls to grow up knowing their hard work and talents will receive the same rewards and recognition as their male counterparts," she tells HuffPost UK.

"What message are we sending out by valuing male endeavours so much more?"

She adds that women's sport coverage also shows "a more diverse range of women than we typically see portrayed on TV – strong, fearless, confident".

"The more images and footage we see of women playing sport or getting active at every level – from grassroots to elite – the more we will feel like it is relevant to us, that parks, playing fields, pitches and pools are spaces for us to enjoy too," she says.

If you want to see broadcasters airing women's sport, Dale says there's one way you can actively campaign: tune in.

"We can't complain about a lack of coverage if we don't watch it," she says.

"So watch the coverage and demand more. Use social media, praise what you see, clamour for more, and let them see the potential audience."

Equal Pay

The gender pay gap is rife within sport. The most recent Forbes roundup of the world's highest paid athletes shows that Cristiano Ronaldo (the world's highest paid male athlete) is paid an estimated $93 million (£69 million) per year. In comparison, Serena Williams (the highest paid woman) is thought to earn $27 million (£20 million) per year.

The disparity is also seen here in the UK. According to the 2016 Women on Boards 'Gender Balance in Global Sport Report', on average male footballers more than three times in a week the amount female players get paid in a year.

Sue Anstiss, CEO of promote PR and founding trustee of the Women's Sport Trust charity, says the pay gap means women can not "fulfil their potential in sport".

"Many women in elite sport still have to work either full or part time – which makes training and competing a real challenge," she tells HuffPost UK.

"It's a vicious circle – women aren't paid equally, so they can't train full time and fulfil their potential, which means the quality of women's sport is criticised, less people watch, therefore there's less media coverage, so fewer sponsors are attracted, which means less funding for women's sport."

To champion equal pay for women in sport, Anstiss says one of the best things you can do is turn up and watch a game.

"Talk about it more – call it out when you see it. On social media or in person," she adds.

"Directly ask the question of the sports and teams you follow – why do Man United (a hugely wealthy club) not support a women's team? Why did Sky invest in a men's cycling team, but not a women's team?"

The Boardroom

Women form less than 30% of the board in more than half our National Governing Bodies and only 24% of those directing elite sport programmes are women.

Ruth Holdaway, chief executive of Women in Sport, says this shows there is still "a significant way for the sector to go to demonstrate its commitment to gender equality".

"In any business environment, we know that increased gender diversity leads to improved performance – so it is in the best interest of sport to ensure there are more female leaders at every level," she tells HuffPost UK.

"But sport is more than just a business, it has a social purpose and receives public funding. The leadership of sport must, therefore, reflect society."

In order to truly have influence in the world of sport, we need more women at top positions, which is what Women in Sport proactively campaigns for through its 'Beyond 30%' initiative.

The charity is working proactively with governing bodies of sport to improve the gender balance of their boards.

But if you want to help get more women in the boardroom, tweet about it, pile on the pressure and make sure governing bodies know it's on our radar.

Prize Money And Sponsorship

Billie Jean King may have helped women in tennis receive equal prize money, but research conducted by BBC Sport earlier this year found that while the gap is narrowing across all sports, it still very much exists.

A total of 83% of sports now reward men and women equal prize money, but the disparities in some areas are still shocking, with cricket, golf and football among the worst offenders.

The study highlighted that in football, the prize money for the next men's World Cup will be £35 million, compared to the last women's total of £2 million.

In addition, male golfers competing in The Open have the chance to win £1.17 million, while the women's prize money is £487,500.

As Holdaway says: "The money athletes are paid reflects the value placed on them by the sport they represent. We want to see women's sport valued and supported to grow."

Of course, prize money is largely tied up with sponsorship, as organisers will use money from sponsorship towards the pot of funds. According to Women In Sport, women's sport sponsorship accounted for only 0.4% of total sports sponsorship between 2011 and 2013.

Things may be set to improve though with big companies - like SSE now sponsoring the Women's FA Cup - leading the way.

"It would have a huge impact if more companies invested in women's sport – more investment means better resources, training and support. It will raise standards even higher," Dale says.

"The companies will benefit too by showing that they take women's sport seriously."

Again, Dale and Holdaway say the best way to campaign for higher prize money and better sponsorship for women's sport is to attend games.

Participation

There's still a gender gap in participation when it comes to sport, with the latest statistics from Sport England showing 40.5% of men take part in sport each year compared to 31.9% of women.

The gap also exists among children, especially in certain sports such as football. Research from the Football Association suggests 2.9 million girls and women play in football teams in the UK, compared to 8.9 million boys and men.

Getting more women and girls playing sport isn't just essential for the nation's health and fitness, it's important for nurturing new talent and raising standards within women's sport.

You can champion participation in sport by helping foster an environment that's inclusive to women, whatever their size or ability.

One way to do that is by supporting Sport England's initiative #ThisGirlCan, using the hashtag on empowering posts on social media.

"This Girl Can has become a movement - I don't think we could switch it off even if wanted to...and we don't," Dale says.

"Our online community of 800,000 women regularly support, encourage and motivate each other to get active, take part and kick the fear of judgement into touch."

The campaign is even expanding overseas with a version in Victoria, Australia, launching on 4 February 2018.

"We're looking at new ways of developing the campaign and reaching more women," Dale adds.

"This is just the beginning – This Girl Can's work won't be complete until every woman and girl, whatever their age, ability or background, feels that that they can too."-1

His popular gardening program Burke's Backyard was a ratings juggernaut for the Nine Network until it was unceremoniously axed in 2004.

But now a major Fairfax Media/ABC investigation can reveal that behind the scenes those who worked with Burke claim he was a "psychotic bully", a "misogynist" and a "sexual predator" who indecently assaulted, sexually harassed and bullied a string of female employees.

"He was a vile, vile human being," said Bridget Ninness, a former producer on Burke's Backyard, who later launched legal action against Burke for psychological abuse. "He was lewd and he was crude" and his constant talk of sex was "designed to confront you and to demean you", she said.

Louise Langdon, a former researcher, was subjected to ongoing harassment by Burke which included trying to remove her top, and on another occasion Burke "put his foot into my rear end, with the view to checking the tone of my ... my backside". He then stated that the firmness of her "backside" wasn't "up to scratch".

Link A series of women have accused Don Burke of sexually harassing them.

"I loathed him, he was just a pig. He was lecherous and sinister," said another former researcher who alleges she was indecently assaulted by Burke.

Even David Leckie, the former chief executive of the Nine Network, said he wasn't surprised to receive our call about Burke. "I've been trying to think of Harvey Weinstein-type people [in Australia] and the only one I can ever come up with is Burke. He was a horrible, horrible man," he said.

Unlike Weinstein, Burke is not accused of rape, but the more than 50 people interviewed during this investigation have made serious allegations about Burke's actions.

"Don Burke was a disgrace because of his behaviour internally and externally," said Sam Chisholm, Leckie's predecessor at Nine.

Chisholm, a stalwart of the industry, also described Burke as "terrible grub". Asked if he felt the network had done enough to rein in Burke's behaviour, Chisholm said he didn't know.

Did anyone ever come to him personally about Burke? "Probably they did, but I don't know. It's a long time ago," he said.

"I think the public that have loved him should know the real Don Burke," said another former highly placed Nine executive. "If Harvey Weinstein's been outed, Don needs to be outed."

However, in a written response, Burke angrily denied comparisons to Weinstein. "I loathe the reported behaviour of Mr Weinstein and hope that the legal system deals with him in such a way as to prevent this happening again.

Suddenly he made this move and grabbed me, grabbed me hard on the breast. This was not a clumsy, oafish move. It was a calculated action. That is what was scary A former researcher

"The bitter irony is that I have had a life-long opposition to sexism and misogyny. Burke's Backyard was a lone bastion of anti-misogyny since its inception in 1987," said Burke.

"He is a high-grade, twisted abuser," said Ms Ninness, who eventually settled out of court with Burke's company over "sustained and systemic psychological abuse" in the workplace.

Burke was "two people", explained a former male crew member. There was the genial gardening guru on camera who was "very, very good at what he did". But off camera the real Burke was described by many of those interviewed as a psychopathic narcissist.

"He was an absolute sexual predator. He was a bully. He was horrible to people in the office. He would often have women in tears. He used to take great delight in it. It was like sport to him," said the former male crew member.

Link Don Burke's program Burke's Backyard was a ratings juggernaut for Channel Nine before it was cancelled in 2004.

When journalist Tracey Spicer announced that she was investigating the behaviour of powerful Australian men in the media in the wake of America's now infamous sex scandal involving film mogul Harvey Weinstein, she was inundated with reports. One name kept recurring – Don Burke.

Among those who came forward was Ms Langdon, now a psychologist who lives in the United States. In 1987 Ms Langdon, then 27, was working as broadcaster Alan Jones' personal assistant when she landed a job as a weekend producer for Burke's gardening program on radio 2UE. She later became a researcher at Burke's Backyard.

"I was told before I went to meet Don that he was sleazy and to be careful," she said. "I was quite shocked about that because the only Don Burke that I knew was the affable Friday night Burke's Backyard gardener.

"So I thought, 'Oh well, how bad can it be?"'

As it turned out, nothing could have prepared Ms Langdon for what was to come.

"Dealing with Don Burke was an endurance test in terms of his persistence in commentary about anything sexual," she said.

On one occasion, while the pair was working at the radio station, Burke insisted she watch a video. To her horror it was a video showing a woman having sex with a donkey.

Ms Langdon was upset and disgusted. "Don was getting so much pleasure from seeing my reaction to it ... I was just, just ... speechless," she said. "I was really overcome."

Burke also subjected Ms Langdon to harassing behaviour – flicking her bra straps and lifting up her shirt to see the colour of her underwear. During a work trip in the Northern Territory he allegedly tried to remove her top.

"I was sitting next to Don on the bus and he decided that it was OK for him to put his hands on my T-shirt and try and pull my bra strap, my bra off and try to somehow remove my clothing. He was trying to take my top off," Ms Langdon said.

Another researcher, who asked not to be named, also recalled being warned about working for Burke. Her job interview was at night at Burke's home, which is on acreage at Kenthurst, a semi-rural suburb in Sydney's Hills district.

The taxi driver expressed concern because he had heard things about Burke and insisted on waiting for her.

During the interview Burke said, "Our nickname for the receptionist is 'the fat c---', so make sure you call her that".

"I think he was testing me to see whether I would be shocked," the woman recalled.

At the time the woman, who was in her late 20s, thought the interview was being held at night because Burke was very busy. But she later came to realise "it was all about power and control ... It was in his own environment so he could control it. It puts you at that disadvantage."

About a month after she started work as a researcher, the woman was having a cigarette on the rooftop garden at the Crows Nest office of Burke's production company, CTC (Cut The Crap) Productions.

The researcher said Burke had been telling her about a cocktail party he was going to that evening. "'You know what I love about cocktail parties?' he mused. 'It's the name tags. I get to grab women's tits while pretending I can't read their name."'

Burke was already standing uncomfortably close to her during the conversation when "suddenly he made this move and grabbed me, grabbed me hard on the breast. This was not a clumsy, oafish move. It was a calculated action. That is what was scary. It was premeditated. I jumped back. He sneered. 'You've got small tits, no one would want to touch your tits'."

"The rooftop incident never occurred," said Burke, who also denied all of Ms Langdon's allegations.

In his written response, Burke denied "absolutely" claims he was bully. Because he was a "perfectionist" and demanded excellence in his production company, "a small number" of former employees were dismissed either for underperformance or misbehaviour. Some of these people "still bear a strong grudge against me", he said.

Wendy Dent was employed as an entertainer when she met Burke at the Melbourne Garden Show in 1995. Burke came over, kneeled before the 21-year-old who was wearing a fairy costume, and asked to be granted a wish. In front of the crew and onlookers, Burke opened his eyes and said, "It didn't work. You've still got your clothes on."

When Burke encouraged her to come to Sydney to audition for his gardening show, Ms Dent recalled a crew member taking her aside to apologise for Burke's "sleazy comment" and also warning her to be careful of him.

Months later, when she had moved to Sydney, Ms Dent took up Burke's offer to audition for the show. Over the phone Burke was flattering, telling Ms Dent she had "real charisma" and great potential. "You definitely have got what it takes for TV," he told her and, what's more, he was "the No. 1 in the business" and he could make it happen.

He said "well, you'll have to audition, but you'll have to be topless".

As a result, she decided she wanted no part of this "sleazy slummy industry".

"These men become dream killers and I lost a career," she said.

Male crew members spoken to by the joint Fairfax Media/ABC investigation confirmed Burke's obsession with breasts and sex.

One former crew member recalled Burke spotting a group of schoolgirls, aged around 14, holding a puppy.

"He stopped and chatted to them and said, 'Do you want me to show you how to hold the puppy properly?"'

Because it was the legendary Don Burke, one of the girls said, "Yeah, that'd be great."

"He showed them how to nurse it close to their chest, keep it nice and warm," the crew member recalled. "When they walked away he exclaimed: 'Give me three!'

"I said, 'three what?' He boasted that he had stroked her nipple three times while showing her how to hold the puppy," said the crew member.

Other crew members talked about Burke's voracious sexual appetite while on the road. The lure of Burke being a national prime-time celebrity meant women of all shapes, sizes and ages were happy to go off with him. "It was pretty much anything with a pulse," said one of his crew.

There were occasions when Burke's behaviour with women worried the crew. The most notorious occasion was referred to by several people as the "Newcastle incident", which involved a young woman who had joined Burke and the crew for drinks after filming that day in Newcastle. As the other crew members retired to bed, Burke was seen leading the unenthusiastic, protesting woman towards the lift.

No one knew what occurred behind Burke's closed door on this occasion or on other occasions but his constant bragging about his exploits the following morning made his crew cringe.

"Don would always come back the next morning and say, 'Oh my God, it was fantastic ... once she got up there it was on for young and old'," said one former crew member.

Another former Nine producer recalled a troubling incident involving Burke. The network had organised the season launch on a boat to celebrate the start of the 1989 season. One of those aboard was an 18-year-old woman who was about to launch her career on a new Nine program.

The young woman had too much to drink so the producer, one of the few who had not been drinking, was asked by a publicity head to escort the woman back to her hotel.

With the assistance of Mike Willesee's driver, he got the woman to the foyer of her hotel only to find that she'd lost her room key. After getting another one from reception, they arrived to find the door to her room slightly ajar. "Sitting in the shadows – in the darkened room, with no lights – was the hunched-over figure of Don Burke," said the producer. "I said, 'What the f--- are you doing here'?"

"Don tried telling me that she'd given him her room key while on the boat so he could teach her 'presentation skills' back in the room," said the producer. After arguing with the network's star for an hour, the producer finally got him to leave the hotel room.

"This was predatory behaviour ... Any normal person would have left straight away, but Don was determined to stay there and do God-knows-what to this girl," he said.

The following day the producer informed executives and the publicity department of Burke's behaviour but no action was taken. When he got back to his desk there were two messages. One was from the young woman thanking him for looking after her.

The other was from Burke. It read: "Thanks very much for saving my bacon last night, mate."

"I remember going, 'You f---er, you f---er!' I'd never come across anything like it and I had done television for years."

Burke denied that the incident occurred.

Despite numerous complaints to Nine executives, both male and female employees were told to soldier on. "There was an institutionalised acceptance of his behaviour and it was actually not just an acceptance, it was an institutionalised enabling," said researcher Louise Langdon.

Leckie confirms that there were complaints made about Burke but suggested he heard them second-hand. "I am not going to mention any specific girls or anything like that," he said.

For one young television writer, the comments Burke made about a young female relative were the last straw. It was the late 1980s and the reporter was 21 when she first went off to interview one of Nine's biggest stars.

Burke continually interrupted the interview with lewd comments such as "I bet you're a demon f--k". The next year she was reluctant to interview him again, "but he was a very, very big star back there and I think that's what people need to take into account".

The second year Burke not only invaded her personal space but made suggestions as to what sexual positions she might enjoy. He also openly stared at and commented about her breasts. It was as though his body language was "I am staring at your boobs and I don't care if you notice, that's what I'm going to do", she said.

Her innocuous question about garden gnomes led to a vulgar comment from Burke about the size of his "cock". Her third encounter with Burke, an interview at his Kenthurst home, was her last.

When Burke said he had bought a horse for a young relative "because I love watching her rub her c--t on its back," the reporter snapped the tape off.

"I was absolutely and utterly repulsed by the man, I felt compromised, I felt violated, I just felt disgusted.

"I took the tape recording to the head of publicity at the time and said I want action. And the next day I received a bunch of flowers and that was the end of it."

There was no apology from Burke and no action was taken against Burke, who told Fairfax Media and the ABC that the story was a "total fabrication".

In 2004 Burke was unceremoniously dumped by the Nine Network after more than 17 years hosting Burke's Backyard.

Over those years countless employees allegedly suffered from Burke's bullying, lewd behaviour and sexual harassment. The network's failure to do anything to rein in Burke's behaviour leaves a bitter taste for many. "Every single person in management ... has known about Don Burke. Every male manager. There is not one that does not know," said a former Nine staffer.

Even the male managers found his incredible ego and narcissistic behaviour impossible to deal with, said the staffer.

"But in terms of the sexual harassment stuff, they didn't really give a damn. He was too popular, he was just too popular a celebrity," said one former senior employee at the network.

Another long-term male producer on Burke's Backyard said that management told staff "to suck it up because it was the No. 1 rating show, the cash cow for Channel Nine".

"Lots of women I know just left. There was a huge staff turnover," he said. "He had the power, the profile and the tacit backing of Channel Nine."

However, the Nine Network refused to accept any responsibility for Burke's behaviour. Questioned about claims that the network turned a blind eye to complaints and failed to take any action to protect their staff from Burke, Nine issued a statement saying: "Burke's Backyard was a production of CTC Productions and they employed and managed all staff."

However, some of Burke's worst behaviour allegedly occurred while the program was produced at Nine. In late 1991 Burke took over the production of his popular gardening program.

Nine also said they could find no records of complaints or payouts to any women in relation to Burke's behaviour.

One woman who did complain paid a very high price.

"He got off on terrorising [female researchers]. Women were his playthings and he loved seeing them shocked by his behaviour and language," said producer Bridget Ninness, who worked at Burke's Backyard for more than seven years from 1990.

On her first overseas trip as a reporter, Burke turned to her and said that if everything did not go smoothly, "I'm going to rip your f---ing head off and shit down your throat".

Ms Ninness was so nervous and upset she vomited. When she complained to the head of news and current affairs Peter Meakin, she alleges he said she needed to have "broad shoulders".

Years later her colleagues at Burke's Backyard encouraged her to take legal action against Burke for the stress and psychological abuse she suffered at his hands. But when she did, Ms Ninness found herself totally alone.

She said David Leckie warned her against the legal action, saying: "We don't want to have to crush you." This was denied by Leckie who said "honestly that is not my speech". He was adamant that the complaints he heard about Burke's behaviour were second-hand.

Similarly Meakin did not recall Ms Ninness's complaint. "I never received any official complaints, written or verbal, that I can recall about his conduct.

"There was gossip about inappropriate language and he was incredibly demanding. If someone fell short of the mark, he would excoriate them," said Meakin, who is now at Channel Ten.

"There was absolutely no care whatsoever for the consequences – the psychological damage, the physical damage," said Ms Ninness. She still suffers post-traumatic stress disorder.

"Twenty years later we are saying actually our lives do matter, our mental health does matter," she said.

"This is unfair and unworthy journalism" from a "small clique of malcontents" who were fired, said Burke.

He enclosed an email from former reporter Jackie French, now a children's author, saying that in the decade she worked closely with Burke she never saw "any hint of sexual harassment, nor heard any gossip".

Michael Freedman, Burke's former CEO, said: "I never observed any sexual harassment. Don's not the kind of person to engage in that type of behaviour."

According to Tracey Spicer, this is a seminal moment for women both in the workplace and society.

Spicer said a generation of women had been lost to the media and entertainment industry "because they were simply sick of being groped and grabbed" while trying to do their job.

"We've put up with sexual harassment and indecent assault for so long and finally we're able to say, 'Enough is enough, let's change the structures within the workplace so women can feel safe'," she said.

BMW's vision of the future is perhaps a little more realistic than that and sees a world where instead of being transported in tiny pods we're actually all driving electric bikes along huge citywide tubes suspended in the air.

BMW

Developed by BMW's Group Technology office in China, the Vision E3 Way is a concept that imagines cities being covered in these transparent superhighways. Inside citizens can easily zip around from A to B using BMW's electric scooters, or bikes. As if to hammer the point home, the concept art rather smugly shows BMW's utopian vision next to the crowded streets of today suggesting that rather than replacing modern roads these new cycle routes would run alongside them.

BMW

While it might look like BMW is just solving a congestion issue by creating more congestion it's actually a pretty realistic view of how our cities are evolving. In China in particular more than a billion people are expected to be living in cities by 2050 and as cities grow the limited space will require some pretty intuitive thinking in order to get everyone to where they want to go. "The BMW Vision E³ Way opens up a whole new dimension of mobility in overcrowded conurbations – efficient, convenient and safe. It works by simply creating space for two-wheel zero-emissions traffic," explains Dr. Markus Seidel, Director BMW Group Technology Office China.

BMW

The highways would all have an automated speed limit of 25km/h, avoiding the presence of road rage and making sure that traffic moves smoothly. BMW also envisages a rental scheme similar to London's own cycle hire scheme for those that aren't blessed with owning an electric bike or scooter.0

Kate McClure, 27, found herself stranded on Interstate 95 after she had run out of gas. Johnny Bobbitt Jr., a homeless veteran, approached her and told her to “get back in the car and lock the doors” while he walked a few blocks and bought her gas with his last $20, McClure wrote on the Gofundme.com campaign she started for Bobbitt.

“He comes back with a red gas can. Using his last 20 dollars to make sure I could get home safe,” she wrote.

McClure said she didn't have any money to repay him at the time but returned to the road several times with her boyfriend to give Bobbitt cash, clothes and food.

FATHER CRIES WHEN FAMILY SURPRISES HIM WITH NEW PUPPY

After a few visits, she started the fundraiser with the hopes of using the money toward housing and other expenses for the 34-year-old Bobbitt.

"I wish that I could do more for this selfless man, who went out of his way just to help me that day," she wrote on the fundraising page. "Truly believe that all Johnny needs is one little break. Hopefully with your help I can be the one to give it to him."

Donations have poured in, and the fundraiser has shattered its goal of raising $10,000 for Bobbitt within 15 days. Over 13,000 people had given to the campaign by Sunday afternoon.

McClure, who told ABC she visits Bobbitt about 2-3 times a week, discovered his old Facebook page that revealed he had been in the U.S. Marine Corps and worked as a firefighter and paramedic before he moved to Philadelphia for a job that fell through. After that, his apartment fell through and he became homeless. But now, he’d like to get re-certified as a paramedic, ABC News reports.

Before the holidays, McClure was able to secure Bobbitt a hotel room. On Thanksgiving Day, McClure posted that Bobbitt had requested her to stop accepting donations on Gofundme because of the overwhelming amount of money that had already been given.

"Johnny asked me to please stop accepting donations today. He is beyond humbled by the amount of support and love he has received over the last few days! He asked, instead of donating to his campaign, to maybe take a second to search for another worthy cause that, for whatever reason, hasn’t gotten the attention his has," she wrote.

However, after receiving major backlash from people wanting to donate to Bobbitt, McClure opened the campaign again.

McClure set up appointments with a lawyer and financial planner, but Bobbitt has been adamant that he will not be keeping all of the money.

http://www.businessinsider.com/vols-to-hire-greg-schiano-to-coach-football-2017-11Tennessee will reportedly hire a coach who once got cursed out by Peyton ManningUSA Today is reporting that the University of Tennessee is finalizing a deal to make Greg Schiano their next football coach.

Schiano had some success at Rutgers, but his most recent stint as a head coach in the NFL was largely viewed as a complete failure.

The two-year stint in the NFL is best remembered for how he angered a lot of people, including Peyton Manning.





Another chip in the coaching carousel appears to be close to falling, as the University of Tennessee is finalizing a deal to make Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano their next football coach, according to Dan Wolken of USA Today.

Schiano was previously the head coach at Rutgers for 11 seasons and had some success at a program that rarely experiences any. However, Schiano's coaching record is better known for his most recent stint as the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFL for two seasons.

The Bucs went 11-21 in those two seasons. ANd those years will best be remembered for how Schiano angered then-New York Giants head coach Tom Coughlin in one incident and Tennessee legend Peyton Manning in another.

In just Schiano's second game as coach of the Bucs, he famously ordered his players to dive for the legs of the Giants players as Eli Manning was taking a knee to run out the clock. The move was universally condemned, and led to Coughlin undressing Schiano after the game.

When Schiano pulled off a similar move in a loss to the Denver Broncos later in the same season, Peyton let Schiano have it and he used language most had never heard Manning use before.

Then Buccaneers defensive lineman Michael Bennett told Mike Silver of NFL.com that Manning "cussed" out Schiano after the game.

"Peyton cussed him out," Bennett told Silver in 2013. "And I ain't never heard Peyton cuss."

So far, the hire by Tennessee is being universally criticized.

Tennessee hiring Schiano is one of the worst coaching moves of the past 10 years, in any sport, on any level. — mike freeman (@mikefreemanNFL) November 26, 2017

Some other stories from Silver about Schiano's time in the NFL won't help. From a 2013 NFL.com account:

I've spoken to enough people who've played for Schiano during his two NFL seasons to conclude that he treats his players like children, which is a major reason he has lost his locker room.

"How bad is it there? It's worse than you can imagine," says one NFL player who spent 2012 with the Bucs. "It's like being in Cuba."

...

Last year, Schiano alienated many of his players and staff members with tantrums like the one I described on "NFL GameDay Morning" last month. According to a current Bucs player -- in an account corroborated by another witness -- Schiano became enraged during a practice late in the 2012 season when special teams coach Bob Ligashesky walked onto the wrong area of the practice field during a drill.

Instead of merely telling Ligashesky to watch where he walked, Schiano launched into a loud tirade and threatened to fire him if he repeated the mistake. When Ligashesky was let go following the season, it was hard not to draw a connection between the tantrum and that decision.

"I think he just wants to flex his power," Bennett says. "He has small (man's) syndrome. I still talk to guys who are there, and trust me, there's not much respect for him in that locker room."

It probably also didn't help that many Vols fans had hoped Tennessee would hire Jon Gruden.0

Franken will enter the public eye for the first time after laying low for eight days, following several sexual misconduct allegations made against him.



MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Sen. Al Franken is telling a local newspaper that he plans to return to work on Monday and is "embarrassed and ashamed" by the groping allegations levied against him.

The Democrat spoke with the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Sunday, marking his first interview since being swept into a nationwide tide of sexual harassment allegations.

At least four women have accused Franken of misconduct. Three of them say he grabbed their buttocks while taking photos with them during campaign events. Franken says he doesn't remember the photos and that such groping is "not something I would intentionally do."

Franken says he's looking forward to returning to work in Congress. Franken missed votes after the first accusations were made public. He says he believes he can gradually regain voters' trust.-1
https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/11/welp-looks-like-imgur-has-also-been-hackedWelp, Looks Like Imgur Has Also Been Hacked2017's unending parade of major companies and web destinations suffering through major breaches of user information has not slowed down. Image-sharing site Imgur revealed it had been hacked several years ago this week, with the details of approximately 1.7 million accounts lost in 2014 to hackers who have not been identified.

Image: Screengrab via Imgur

Per ZDNet, this hack may be less of a reason for concern for many of the users involved as Imgur only collects email addresses and passwords, rather than any other personally identifiable information like physical addresses, phone numbers or credit card data.

In a blog post on Friday, the company said it was "still actively investigating the incident," but it had determined that its database "may have been cracked with brute force due to an older hashing algorithm (SHA-256) that was used at the time."

Imgur says it subsequently updated his database to use the the newer bcrypt algorithm, which is significantly harder to break, in 2016.

In particular, users who use the same password on multiple sites (which is probably most people) or those who uploaded personally identifiable content to Imgur -- like, say, anyone who may have uploaded nude photos of themselves for distribution on Reddit -- should be interested in changing their passwords.

Still, this is much less devastating than some of the very serious hacks to occur recently, like the leak of over 145 million Americans' personal information from credit rating agency Equifax, or a major Uber data breach that the company covered up by allegedly paying the hackers $US100,000 ($131,278).

The breach was originally discovered by data researcher Troy Hunt, who runs the user-notification service Have I Been Pwned; the majority of the passwords were already in his database of compromised accounts.

Hunt told ZDNet that he had been sent the stolen data by another source and notified the company on Thursday. By Friday, Imgur had already publicly disclosed the breach.

"I disclosed this incident to Imgur late in the day in the midst of the U.S. Thanksgiving holidays," Hunt told the site. "That they could pick this up immediately, protect impacted accounts, notify individuals and prepare public statements in less than 24 hours is absolutely exemplary."

https://www.yahoo.com/news/franken-says-hes-ashamed-harassment-allegations-looking-forward-getting-back-work-201344486.htmlFranken says he's 'ashamed' by harassment allegations but 'looking forward to getting back to work'Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said on Sunday that he is “embarrassed and ashamed” about the allegations by multiple women of sexual harassment against him, but that he is “looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow.”

“I’ve let a lot of people down, and I’m hoping I can make it up to them and gradually regain their trust,” Franken told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “I know I have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the people I’ve let down, the people of Minnesota, my friends and colleagues, everyone who counts on me to be a champion for women.”

The comments are the first Franken has made publicly since the initial allegations were made against him. Earlier this month, radio host Leeann Tweeden accused Franken of forcibly kissing her during a 2006 holiday USO war zone tour and having a picture taken of himself with his hands over her chest while she was asleep on a transport military plane.

Three other women came forward with accusations that Franken groped them as they posed with him for photographs on three separate occasions between 2007 and 2010.

The 66-year-old senator and former “Saturday Night Live ” star said that he has taken “tens of thousands” of photos since first running for office and doesn’t recall the alleged encounters.

“I don’t remember these photographs, I don’t,” he said. “This is not something I would intentionally do.”

Franken told the Star Tribune that he has been “thinking about how that could happen” and needs “to be more careful and a lot more sensitive in these situations.”

The newspaper also asked Franken if he expects more women to come forward.

“If you had asked me two weeks ago, ‘Would any woman say I had treated her with disrespect?’ I would have said no. So this has just caught me by surprise,” Franken said. “I certainly hope not.”

In a Nov. 16 blog post, Tweeden said that Franken “mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth” during a rehearsal for a skit the pair were performing for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2006. Tweeden told Franken she didn’t want to rehearse the kiss, but he insisted.

“I felt disgusted and violated,” Tweeden wrote.

Tweeden also posted the photo of Franken apparently pretending to grab her breasts as she slept aboard a military transport plane.

Franken apologized in a statement the same day.

“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” Franken said. “As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny, but wasn’t. I shouldn’t have done it.”

Shortly after Franken’s apology, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called for the Senate Ethics Committee to look into the allegations. Franken agreed, and said he would cooperate.

“While I don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women’s experiences,” the senator said.

Montana won’t lose any acres or protections for its current national monuments, and the state may also get a brand-new 200-square-mile national monument. That could happen even as the ink dries on Zinke’s recommendation to open millions of acres of public land in other states to oil and gas interests.

Zinke recommended the massive Badger-Two Medicine area in northwest Montana be designated as a national monument over the summer. The designation would protect the federal lands from any oil and gas development.

President Donald Trump has called public lands monuments across the nation a “massive land grab.” And Zinke has advised Trump to shrink or reduce protections for millions of acres in 10 monuments in other states.

That’s why a new monument in Montana has locals “scratching their heads,” notes NPR.

“As you’re attacking the seminal accomplishments of [President Theodore] Roosevelt [who first established national monuments] and at the same time talking about adding a monument, it didn’t make much sense,” Land Tawney, head of the Montana-based Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, told the Missoulian.

Zinke, a former Montana congressman, grew up a couple of hours west of the area he has recommended protecting from drilling rights. But many speculate that his public-lands strategy is less about familiarity and more about political strategy. Tawney and others believe Zinke will run for governor of the state when he’s done serving Trump.

“I think the people of Montana hold our special places very near and dear,” Tawney told NPR. “If you do not protect those places I think it’s a political nightmare for you in this state.”

Other states hold their special places near and dear as well. The White House hasn’t revealed Zinke’s recommendations for those sites. But in a memorandum obtained by The Washington Post in September, Zinke advised Trump to modify 10 national monuments, including shrinking at least four in Western states and dropping drilling protections for others.

Zinke advised shrinking Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, Nevada’s Gold Butte, and Oregon’s Cascade-Siskiyou. The Utah sites alone comprise some 3.2 million acres. Zinke’s memorandum doesn’t specify how many acres might be cut. Reducing protections could also open up remaining land to commercial fishing, grazing, logging and coal mining.

In Zinke’s memo, he notes that the 130,000-acre Two Badger-Medicine site is sacred to the Blackfeet Nation. Bears Ears in Utah is sacred to the Navajo Nation, yet that’s on the chopping block. The other site in Utah, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes some of the most important dinosaur fossil sites in the world.-1

Lucky for us, the folks at fashion retailer Long Tall Sally researched the top trends worn all over the globe. Not only is it interesting to see the trends people in other countries love, but the results also provide a little fashion inspiration for your wardrobe.

With the help of a trends expert, Long Tall Sally analyzed thousands of global trends via street style images, local influencers and Instagram posts. The trends were then cross-referenced with Instagram data from the last 12 months. The top trend in each country was determined by looking at the most frequently used trend-related hashtag.

For example, in Seoul, South Korea, oversized sleeves were determined to be the top trend, with 15,638 hashtags. In Bangkok, Thailand, millennial pink was all the rage, hashtagged 15,411 times, and over 2,420 Instagram posts in Nigeria showed love for off-the-shoulder looks.

The most classically simple trend, the plain white T-shirt, reigned supreme in France, while fashionistas in the United Kingdom were all about metallic shoes. In America, style differences between east and west were clear, with West Coasters loving their logo tees and East Coasters rocking colorful faux fur.0

Sure, someone can fail in politics, but can someone fail out of politics? A person can lose an election, be booted from a committee or sprout fungus from too many decades on the back bench. However, can a person screw up so badly that they aren’t let back in? Are there personae non gratae in the world of governance? Are there proverbial ice floes upon which the truly ostracized are plopped, their phone calls never to be returned again?

“I guess if you’ve murdered somebody, I assume that’s a bright line that exists,” mused Liz Mair, a GOP communications consultant. “Short of that, I’m not sure there’s anything you can say, 100 percent, that will kill off somebody’s career.”

Spurred on by Roy Moore’s continued competitiveness in the Alabama special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Senate seat ― this despite a mounting number of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, including charges as severe as sexual assaulting a minor ― HuffPost set out to answer a simple question: What on earth do you have to do to become so toxic that you can’t find gainful employment in or around politics?

In conversations with disheartened journalists, activists, lobbyists and other political operators, the closest answer that could be found was somewhat less than heartening.

Murder … maybe?

“Well, there was the politician who said you could do anything as long as you weren’t found in bed with a live boy or a dead girl,” recalled veteran political reporter and commentator Eleanor Clift, paraphrasing former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards (D).

Clift cited Bob Packwood, the veteran Oregon Republican senator who was forced to resign in 1995 after 19 women ― some who had worked for him ― accused him of sexual misconduct. Despite being forced out of his seat under threat of expulsion, Packwood soon founded a successful lobbying firm, representing major corporate clients and appearing from time to time at hearings and other notable events in Washington.

Mark Leibovich, New York Times Magazine chief national correspondent and author of This Town, this decade’s buzziest anthropological study of Washington, sees a shift in attitudes, but notes that D.C.’s culture of second chances runs deep ― at least for its public figures ― so long as the redeemed person is politically useful.

“There has always been the barrel, and there have always been people spending time in it,” said Leibovich of periods of political exile and infamy. “What do you have to do to never emerge from the barrel? It’s a pretty forgiving barrel. The cushion is time.”

“I do think it’s an interesting time for barrel sciences,” he added.

Marvin Gentry/Reuters Roy Moore speaks in Vestavia Hills, Alabama, on Nov. 11, 2017.

Indeed, Washington has a dubious history of second acts: Oliver North is now a Fox News contributor; Anthony Weiner ran a viable campaign for mayor; Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) won re-election as a “pro-life” crusader after pressuring his mistress to get an abortion; Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) hiked the Appalachian Trail all the way back to Congress; former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) had a very public episode involving diapers and prostitutes, yet won re-election.

While the dynamics of political scandals are certainly changing, whether there’s been a net improvement in how Washington metabolizes bad actors is another question altogether.

On the one hand, as nearly everyone interviewed by HuffPost noted, the allegations of sexual misconduct against a number of public officials have prompted a long-overdue reckoning with sexual harassment and assault in politics.

On the other hand, the increasing tribalism of today’s politics can distract from any number of sins, providing lifelines to perpetrators who might otherwise have not had a second chance in a pre-Fox News era.

There is always a large audience of people ready to believe that the charges against you are politically motivated, so long as you’re willing to toe the line on their politics. It is in this context that cynicism creeps in — that despite the changing times, you still can’t help but wonder if a Russia Today show is entirely out of the question for Anthony Weiner when he gets out of prison.

“I think all of politics now is becoming this weird reality TV show where Americans have given up on politics being something noble or something to look up to ― and that’s a rational decision, because it hasn’t been for a long, long time,” observed Sam Geduldig, a prominent Republican lobbyist and erstwhile senior aide to former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).

Figures like Moore can “cocoon themselves into a social media sphere that will accept them,” Leibovich noted, citing pro-Trump outlets like Breitbart News.

To wit, in the last 12 months, Sebastian Gorka, a man with ties to Hungarian fascists and whose White House tenure could charitably be described as an utter disaster, landed a Fox News contributing gig; Sean Spicer enjoyed a soft landing with a teaching gig at Harvard and a cameo on the Emmys after an institution-damaging tenure as White House press secretary; and Greg Gianforte won a seat in Congress after being arrested for assaulting a reporter.

And, of course, Donald Trump, a man who admitted on tape to sexually assaulting women, was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

STR New/Reuters Former Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) arrives on Capitol Hill ahead of his resignation on Sept. 7, 1995. Despite being accused of sexual misconduct by 19 women, Packwood went on to have a lucrative career in Washington.

Many people interviewed by HuffPost see the ethical waters being muddied by Trump’s electoral success. While they note that many victims now feel emboldened to speak out about the mistreatment they’ve endured, others might feel deflated by Trump’s success. Equally alarming, they add, is how Trump’s triumphs encourage bad actors.

Jess McIntosh, editor-in-chief of the progressive website Shareblue and a former communications aide for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, believes Trump’s election encouraged conservatives of all stripes to defend bad behavior like Trump’s lest they be deprived of access and influence in Republican politics.

“There’s a place for a mindful conservative voice, but you’re not getting a talk radio show,” said McIntosh. “You’re going on MSNBC, you’re writing an occasional New York Times op-ed.”

“Either you become a king in that cesspool or you go away,” McIntosh concluded.

What’s more, the current success of figures like Trump and Gianforte can denude lesser, though still serious, political transgressions of their shock value.

Mair, looking back on Mark Sanford’s 2009 disappearance and subsequent botched cover-up of his mistress, noted with dark humor how that scandal now seems quaint by comparison.

“Yes, he obviously lied about stuff; yes, he had an affair,” recalled Mair. “This wasn’t a guy who was diddling interns, this was a guy who had an affair because he truly loved somebody. It was the purest form of ethical malfeasance.”

Jim Manley, who served as communications director for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed that dispiriting sentiment.

“In this day and age, the fallback appears to be, ‘Thank God the member appears to not be sleeping with an intern,’” he said.

Or, as one senior Republican lobbyist speaking on condition of anonymity put it: “Consensual infidelity is the new chivalry.”

Former Congressman Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is perhaps the best current example of how the “anything goes” attitude of the Trump era and the increasingly tribal nature of our politics can serve as lifelines to fallen politicians.

Grimm, who in 2014 pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud and once threatened to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony on live TV, announced in October that he will seek his old seat representing Staten Island. His announcement was followed by a photo of him posing with former Trump adviser and Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon.

“Michael Grimm could make it back,” asserted Geduldig. “In light of all else that is out there, the bar has been lowered. Truly inappropriate behavior that had previously gone unreported is the new bar. What Mark Halperin did is worse than any shit that Michael Grimm did.”

So what about Moore? Assuming, for the sake of argument, that he either loses his election or is expelled from the Senate ― though assuming such things is often a recipe for disappointment in Washington and politics ― what’s next for a man accused by no less than six women of sexual impropriety?

Perhaps a book deal with a conservative imprint? Or a talk radio program on a far-right radio network? Or a Sean Hannity-style show on the conservative OAN TV network? Perhaps ― dare we indulge our most cynical impulses ― another run for Senate?

No one HuffPost spoke to was willing to say that Moore would disappear from politics completely, absent jail time.

“It wouldn’t shock me, if Roy Moore loses, to see him in Des Moines at some point in the next few years,” predicted Leibovich.-1

People living close to where a stolen Renault Clio hit a tree on Stonegate Road, in the Meanwood area of Leeds, on Saturday night, described a terrible scene of bodies laid in the road and a vehicle reduced to a crumpled mess of metal barely recognisable as a car. A vigil was held opposite the tree late on Sunday night for the five people who died – named locally as brothers Ellis and Elliott Thornton, aged 12 and 15; Darnell Harte, 15, Anthoney Armour, 28, and Robbie Meerun, 24.

Police said two of the deceased were pronounced dead at the scene and three died a short time later at hospital. One man who lives close to the crash site said: “It was unbelievable. “You couldn’t even recognise it as a car. It was just a crumpled mess.” His wife said: “There were bodies laid about, it was awful. It was as bad as that.” She added: “We were just sat here and we just heard an almighty crash. We sat here and thought ‘what the heck was that?’.”

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said it was not possible to tell whether the dead and injured had been in the car or walking along the street at the time. Another woman said her husband ran up the road and could not believe what little was left of the car. She said: “It was just a lump of metal that was not recognisable as a car.”

All those who died were male, said officers, who confirmed two more 15-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and remain in custody. One of these youths is understood to have been taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. On Sunday, floral tributes to those who died began to accumulate opposite the tree. One tribute pinned to the flowers read: “Darnell (gone too soon). It just doesn’t make sense. Hope now you’re at some peace. Will remember you for your cheekiness.” One of the mothers of the deceased visited the scene of the crash on Sunday afternoon, clearly distressed and did not talk to waiting media. A police spokesman said officers were confronted by a scene of “complete carnage” when they arrived at the crash site.

Am I supposed to be here? Did I get here because I deserved it? Or was there a quota to be filled? Suddenly I feel like I need to work harder to prove myself, sound more intelligent, be more polite. Socialising becomes exhausting; I find myself questioning everything I say and do to the point where I wish I was back at home.

The idea that I am proud or lucky to have broken through the barriers of receiving a world class education should be an outdated view in today’s society. I should be shocked. Being told how to feel about it is also disconcerting, as if I’m being robbed of another aspect of autonomy. Such as the woman in the ‘racist’ Dove ad: some people were upset understandably, she was not and that’s fine too.

Though genuine and heartfelt, there was no delight in my realisation. Honouring itself as “a diverse intellectual community” and thus naming itself “London’s Global University,” one would assume that a University College London graduation hall flooded with hundreds of people would have one other black graduate there. But I was left to ‘represent’ alone.

From my first day of university, I had been pigeon-holed as my race. Being handed the key to my shared room, the receptionist jumped, ecstatic to inform me that my room-mate would also be black. Not into art, from London or even coming from a year abroad like myself, but black. It was not until I realised there would be only one other black female aside from us in that building that the significance of the situation would have weight. “Is this diversity?” I would ask.

As great as my university experience was, my course highlighted the racial disparity even further. My History of Art degree discussed me as ‘Other’, constantly highlighting being black and female connotes being watched, policed. Either they were in the art as some sort of server or slave to be subjugated as in Manet’s Olympia. A black female artist could not just make art for art’s sake, she must be ‘fighting,’ must be ‘angry’. Of course, it was discussed to ensue change, but clarified that to be watched is to be controlled by others — just like the use of the provocative image of Lola Olufemi, paired with an emotive (and wrong) headline, underlined the notion of black women as overtly sexual and aggressive, edging back toward the time of Saartjie Baartman.

When I did look around in that hall full of people, what I did notice is the person who served me the champagne was black. So was the person who helped me put on my robe, who made the effort to help me with my braids as I struggled to find a hat big enough to fit.

In my three years, I saw one black lecturer. She began in my second year, straight from America. And thus, the news that no black academics have worked in senior management roles in any British university in the last three years comes as no surprise. But at least there are always cleaners and baristas. So not only am I underrepresented as a student, but also underrepresented as staff, perpetuating the idea that I am not meant to be there. As a man once told me at the age of sixteen as I read on the bus, “people like you shouldn’t be doing that.” Six years on, this is what I am inadvertently told again.

I am in no way undermining this women’s attempt at pointing out a change she clearly seeks herself. However, although sincere, her congratulation carried the same white naivety as the upset lady who screamed “you must be more upset than the rest of us” when Brexit was announced — my British passport tucked away in my drawer.

So when will I be proud? When I can walk around, be represented, work, not only as a black person, but one with as much room to define myself as my peers. When black people feel comfortable enough to apply to those universities. When those universities start accepting them. When the black people I see are not just the cleaners or political activists trying to change that, but integrated in all aspects of society. When I am the norm, and articles like this are no longer needed.-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/michael-sheldrick/the-government-s-new-foreign-policy-white-paper-is-a-fail-when-it-comes-to-aid_a_23286849/The Government’s New Foreign Policy White Paper Is A Fail When It Comes To Aid"This Government has presided over the biggest aid cuts under any government in Australian history."

The Turnbull Government's new Foreign Policy White Paper is a missed opportunity for Australia to show bold and determined leadership in the fight to end extreme poverty.

Launched by no less than the Prime Minister himself, the paper makes reference to Australia's responsibility to alleviate poverty, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Indeed, it argues explicitly that "as a prosperous country, Australia has a responsibility to contribute to global efforts to reduce poverty, alleviate suffering and promote sustainable development".

And to give credit where credit is due, the paper includes a strong reiteration of Australia's commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals -- the United Nation's 17-point plan to end extreme poverty, achieve universal health coverage, mitigate climate change and reduce inequality by 2030.

Welcome as well is the the explicit acknowledgement that economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region must be inclusive to ensure remote and marginalised communities are not left behind.

The paper admits the fact that 10 percent of the world's population -- some 750 million people -- continue to live on less than $1.90 a day. This speaks for itself as to where Australia can have a significant and positive impact in the world.

The continued neglect of Australia's aid program is not only out of step with community values, but ultimately with our own history.

Yet for all the lofty talk and rhetoric, the new approach is lacking in substance when it comes to recognising Australian Aid as a core foreign policy priority. Indeed, the reference to having a "responsibility to contribute" almost rings hollow given the Turnbull Government's own recent performance on this issue. After all, this is the same government that has presided over the biggest aid cuts under any government in Australian history.

That the new foreign policy paper is meant as a long-term comprehensive policy framework, designed to lay out overall priorities as opposed to propose specific measures, is no excuse for this admission.

By comparison, the launch last year of the Turnbull Government's Defense White Paper paved the way for the biggest upsurge in military spending since World War II; from $32 billion per year to almost $60 billion p.a. by 2025.

Despite accounting for a much smaller percentage of government spending, however, no such increased commitment to Australian Aid accompanied the launch of the Foreign Policy White Paper. This is despite the fact that alleviating poverty is both the right thing to do for a prosperous nation like Australia, and in line with our international obligations under the Sustainable Development Goals.

Additionally, the lack of any signal to significantly increase the scale and scope of Australian Aid goes against one of the explicit objectives of the new paper; specifically, to keep "our Indo-Pacific region secure, open and prosperous".

As I've argued before, investing in efforts to reduce poverty, raise healthcare standards and provide access to education among developing countries in our region is arguably just as critical to defense spending in safeguarding regional prosperity.

That the paper does not treat the Australian Aid program as a core foreign policy priority also overlooks the strong support expressed in the community for Australia to show bold leadership here.

As the Government's own report of its public consultation process highlights, more submissions were received in support of a stronger Australian Aid program than any other issue.

Through a consultation conducted on behalf of the Campaign for Australian Aid, more than 8,000 Australians formally submitted to the Government their strong support for bigger and better aid program.

Likewise, a quick review of the #FPWhitePaper hashtag on Twitter -- which the Government encouraged people to use to register their ideas -- reveals that Australian Aid was consistently (and positively) mentioned. Indeed, our own Global Citizen supporters alone made more than 15,000 individual tweets as part of the consultative process.

MEDIA RELEASE: International aid should have the same level of priority as defence, trade and diplomacy #FPWhitePaperhttps://t.co/prk1Wa9wZD — CARE Australia (@CAREAustralia) November 23, 2017

The continued neglect of Australia's aid program is not only out of step with community values, but ultimately with our own history. Past governments of both political persuasions have been both willing and capable of shouldering a leadership role in pursuit of the global public good -- often for no other reason that it being the right thing to do.

Former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans recently recounted in his new book, 'The Incorrigible Optimist', how Australia led the charge in mobilising sanctions to end apartheid in South Africa, despite it being "so little of our own making".

Similarly, it should not be forgotten that it was under none other than John Howard's watch when the Australian Aid program first begin to significantly increase; only to be slashed right back less than a decade later.

Ultimately, much will be written about the merits and shortfalls of the new Foreign Policy paper in coming days. As someone who has observed closely the foreign policy of this Government in recent years, from both near and afar, it serves to reaffirm for me personally a disconcerting trend.

Namely that for all the lip service government ministers may pay to Australia's responsibility to contribute to the alleviation of suffering and poverty in our region, our aid program continues to lack the attention it deserves.

The drastic cuts that have been imposed are set to become one of the unfortunate legacies of this Government. Of course, there is still time left to reverse this, but with just a year and a half left at best until the next federal election the clock is ticking.

For the sake of the world's most vulnerable and remote communities, I hope the Government changes course.-1

After news broke on Sunday night that Australian opening batsman Cameron Bancroft had allegedly been headbutted by England player Jonny Bairstow, you thought uh oh, here we go. Is this another incident on the Ben Stokes scale of seriousness?

Relax, it was not.

In fact, the incident has provided Australian captain Steve Smith with the great big belly laugh he clearly needed after an epic man-of-the-match performance in the first Ashes Test at the Gabba-- and the rest of us can laugh along with him.

The incident in question happened in Perth a few weeks ago when West Australian players met up by chance with England players at a bar in Perth. Bancroft was then playing for WA and had never previously met Bairstow.

At Monday's post-match press conference at the Gabba, Bancroft was even more impressive with his comic timing and delivery than he had been with his timing at the batting crease, where he made 82 not out in Australia's second innings.

"He greeted me with, uh, yeah, a headbutt kind of thing," he said of the incident, as the room started to chortle.

"I was expecting a handshake. It wasn't the greeting of choice that I was expecting."

The room was losing it now, and Steve Smith was the first to crack up.

"It was certainly no malice in his action and we continued on having a very good conversation for the rest of the evening," the young opener continued.

"At the time he said sorry. For me personally it was just really weird, you know obviously it was just so random and I certainly didn't expect it coming."

Smith briefly looked down to compose himself at this point, like a naughty schoolboy trying to suppress a smirk. He was going OK too. The sensible captain's face was about to return. And then...

"As I said, a handshake or a hug would have been something that I probably would have expected more than a headbutt," Bancroft said.

And Smith just lost it all over again.

Bancroft wasn't done. The charm of his explanation was how he played it as straight as the bat he'd played in the middle of the Gabba.

"I don't know Jonny Bairstow, but he says hello to people very differently to most others," Bancroft deadpanned.

Gold.

"He didn't knock me over. I have the heaviest head in the West Australian squad... there's an actual measurement.

There's an actual WHAT? Steve Smith couldn't seem to believe it either.

"It was a good hit," Bancroft continued. "Play on."

Thus did Australian cricket unearth not just a promising batsman but a fine comic talent. And a great Australian sporting victory found its ideal final act.

Meanwhile, England captain Joe Root brushed aside the controversy over the incident in slightly more traditional fashion at the post-match press conference, describing it as a "mountain out of a molehill".

Bairstow himself said it had been "blown out of all proportion".

"As you saw out there today, there is no animosity between myself or Cameron any of the other Australian players," he said.

However England coach Trevor Bayliss did say his players would get a "stern talking-to" about their drinking culture.0

Asia Argento shared a black-and-white image of her meetup with Rose McGowan and Annabella Sciorra on Saturday, accompanied by a message of support: “You are my sister / And I love you / May all of your dreams come true / I want this for you / They’re gonna come true.” The soirée was apparently catered by celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, who is dating Argento. He chimed in over Twitter, writing, “It was an honor to cook for this meeting of the minds.”

McGowan shared the same image, in color, on her Instagram page on Friday alongside a caption that read “Magical moments.” The actress also tagged Ronan Farrow, who authored a series of reports about Weinstein’s alleged serial sexual assault, harassment and efforts to cover it up. Farrow didn’t appear to be at the gathering.

A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Nov 24, 2017 at 5:30pm PST

In October, Weinstein was fired from The Weinstein Company, an influential studio he co-founded, as more women publicly accused him of misconduct. After a New York Times report revealed that McGowan had received a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein in 1997 for a nondescript “episode” that took place “in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival,” the actress stated that Weinstein had raped her. McGowan has vocally supported other women who say Weinstein assaulted and harassed them. In one article for The New Yorker, Argento told Farrow that Weinstein had once forcibly performed oral sex on her, which led to complicated sexual encounters. The producer “terrified” her, she said, adding, “It wouldn’t stop. It was a nightmare.” In a separate New Yorker piece, Sciorra opened up about her own experiences, saying that she fought Weinstein as he raped her, and that he harassed her for years afterward. “From 1992, I didn’t work again until 1995,” she said. “I just kept getting this pushback of ‘we heard you were difficult, we heard this or that.’ I think that that was the Harvey machine.” Earlier this week, Sciorra posted a photo on Instagram showing her posing with Argento, Farrow and Rosanna Arquette, who’s leveled accusations of her own against the producer.

“Our reporter and his editors agonized over the tone and content of the article,” Times national editor Marc Lacey wrote in a response to readers. “The point of the story was not to normalize anything but to describe the degree to which hate and extremism have become far more normal in American life than many of us want to think.”

The story, which ran on Saturday, spotlighted white supremacist Tony Hovater of New Carlisle, Ohio. The portrait of the “Nazi sympathizer next door” and his hatred for Jews, admiration for Adolf Hitler and belief in racial segregation is told against the backdrop of him cooking pasta at home, contemplating his honeymoon and enjoying “Seinfeld” ― all details critics say inadvertently normalized people like Hovater.

In its response, the Times said some saw the value in using those details to show how easy it is for the average American to adopt such radical views. “People mad about this article want to believe that Nazis are monsters we cannot relate to,” the Times quoted from Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer’s tweet.-1

Residents of Markham City in Ontario, Canada got an unexpected visit from a moose on Friday.

The lost and frightened moose ran through the highly populated and residential areas of the city trying to find its way back home. The moose took itself on quite an adventure, running through backyards, across main roads and through car parks.

The moose was first sighted at 7am on Friday and as news spread about their unusual visitor, Markham residents were shocked by its tour of the city.

"It's very strange. We have had deer around here and foxes, but not a moose. It's pretty amazing," one resident told CTV.

Wildlife experts and police had a big job on their hands trying to detain the moose to keep both the animal and the city's people safe. Initially, police attempted to find the 360-kilogram moose, tranquilise it and move it to a more northern location in the state, but eventually the creature found its own way into a wooded area just outside of the city.

The moose is now believed to have managed to relocate itself to the safety of its wild habitat.0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/26/is-bulletproof-coffee-good-for-you_a_23286795/Is Bulletproof Coffee Good For You?If you frequent gyms and social media, you probably know someone who swears by bulletproof coffee. Maybe that person is even you. Created by 'bio-hacker' Dave Asprey, bulletproof coffee is popular among keto diet advocates as a way to boost energy and fat-burning abilities in the morning.

If you're wondering what bulletproof coffee really is, its proposed benefits and whether it's healthy, HuffPost Australia enlisted the help of three health experts to answer all your questions.

What is bulletproof coffee?

Bulletproof coffee is a drink consisting of brewed coffee, grass-fed unsalted butter and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) coconut oil.

Bulletproof coffee is mostly popular with people following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.

When do you drink bulletproof coffee?

"Bulletproof coffee is designed to be drunk on an empty stomach instead of breakfast and prior to working out as it helps to increase energy and endurance," nutritionist Fiona Tuck told HuffPost Australia.

"This is due to the combination of caffeine and fats fuelling the body. It is very high in calories and fat which is why it is recommended that it replaces a meal and not drunk with a meal, which would lead to consumption of excess calories and potential weight gain."

Is bulletproof coffee good for you?

To understand whether bulletproof coffee is good or bad for you, let's break it down into the proposed benefits and the arguments for and against.

The proposed benefits

"The proposed health benefits are mostly weight loss and increased energy levels, aimed particularly at those on a ketogenic diet or low-carb, high-fat diet," accredited practising dietitian and performance dietitian Jessica Spendlove said. "It also claimed to improve cognitive function and boost metabolism."

Bulletproof coffee is also said to boost mood, suppress appetite and be anti-inflammatory.

Bulletproof coffee typically uses pure organic coffee.

While anecdotally bulletproof coffee appears to be beneficial for many keto dieters, there is currently limited quality scientific research to back up these claims, Spendlove explained.

"The three bulletproof coffee components of saturated fat, coffee and grass-fed butter may have health benefits in isolation, but there is no conclusive research or controlled trials supporting the purported health claims of bulletproof coffee."

The good

1. Fuel for people on a keto diet

"For those on a ketogenic diet, the fat requirement is necessary to provide fuel for the brain and body as the body has been trained to burn fat for fuel, rather than traditional carbohydrates," Tuck said.

Ketones act as the primary fuel source on ketogenic diets or during states of starvation, when glucose (broken down from dietary carbohydrate) is not available. Drinking bulletproof coffee could then be beneficial for energy as it elevates ketone levels in the blood.

"Some people claim improved brain function, mental alertness and energy after consuming the drink -- however, this could simply be due to the caffeine and fat which can be found readily as part of any healthy diet."

Bulletproof coffee is popular among keto advocates.

2. Contains omega-3s

Grass-fed butter tends to be higher in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin K than traditional grain-fed cows.

"Butter also contains important fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin E and vitamin D -- nutrients necessary for bone health and a healthy immune system. Vitamin K2 is important not only for healthy bones but also for a healthy cardiovascular disease," Tuck said.

From this perspective, including grass-fed butter is a positive, but you could be adding it to eggs rather than drinking it straight.

3. Contains coffee

According to a new study, people who drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day are more likely to see health benefits than harm, experiencing lower risks of premature death and heart disease than those who abstain.

"Coffee contains some antioxidant benefits due to its polyphenol content, but the quality depends on the quality of the coffee," Tuck said.

"Many bulletproof coffee advocates will therefore only use pure organic coffee with minimal processing and no artificial pesticide residues."

Once again, you can obtain the benefits of coffee by drinking it at any time of day without the other ingredients required for bulletproof coffee.

The bad

1. Reduces your nutrient intake

"As bulletproof coffee replaces an entire meal, it means you're reducing your nutrient intake greatly but not your energy intake. This would put a lot more pressure on fitting all your daily nutrients into your remaining meals and snacks across the day," Spendlove said.

"In my opinion this does not constitute a healthy, well-balanced breakfast as it is lacking in protein, important vitamins and fibre," Tuck added.

2. High in saturated fats

While the jury is still out on whether saturated fats actually play a role in heart disease, most health experts agree it's better to opt for unsaturated fats found in nuts, seeds, avocado and oily fish.

"While we're not as worried about fat consumption as in the past, the type of fat is still important," accredited practising dietitian Chloe McLeod told HuffPost Australia.

"Saturated fats tend to be the ones we want to eat less of -- however, if the saturated fat is coming from a quality product (such as grass-fed butter as opposed to highly-processed butter), the fat profile does vary slightly.

"As a general rule of thumb, if the saturated fat is in a highly processed food, it is less likely to be a healthier version of it."

Replacing a healthy, balanced breakfast with bulletproof coffee displaces a lot of important nutrients.

As fat is calorie-dense, over-consumption can be easy. Eating an excess of any type of fat can lead to weight gain. So, while dietary fat is essential, it's important to not overdo it.

"Bulletproof coffee could lead to weight-gain, particularly for those not following a ketogenic diet," Spendlove said.

"For an individual on a regular carbohydrate-containing diet, bulletproof coffee at breakfast isn't likely to provide the satisfaction and energy levels that it would for someone on a ketogenic diet. This could lead to an overall increase in energy intake throughout the day."

Salmon, almonds and avocado are types of unsaturated fats.

3. Can cause stomach upset

A high fat intake at breakfast may cause stomach upset in some individuals, particularly those with gastrointestinal conditions like IBS.

"This is because fat stimulates gut motility (gut motor activity). This also wouldn't be ideal for athletes or active individuals before a morning workout, as high fat meals may impair performance due to gut discomfort," Spendlove said.

4. Not a balanced breakfast

With its absence of complex carbs, protein and many vitamins and minerals, a bulletproof coffee in place of breakfast does not meet all the guidelines of a 'balanced' breakfast.

"Essentially [bulletproof coffee] is water, fat and caffeine, along with a handful of antioxidants and micronutrients," McLeod said.

Spendlove agreed, saying a bulletproof coffee and regular balanced breakfast are very different nutritionally-speaking.

"For most people a healthy, balanced breakfast greatly outweighs a bulletproof coffee," Spendlove said.

"Bulletproof coffee contains approximately 440 calories (1,840 kilojoules), one gram of protein and 50 grams of fat -- 80 percent of which is saturated (based on a bulletproof coffee made with two tablespoons of MCT oil and two tablespoons of butter). This also means no fibre and no carbohydrate."

Health experts recommend balanced breakfasts like this.

Compared to a more traditional, balanced breakfast of a similar energy value: two poached eggs, one slice of whole grain sourdough, ¼ medium avocado and one cup of strawberries. This contains approximately 400 calories, 20 grams of protein, 38 grams of carbohydrate, eight grams of fibre and 18 grams of fat (three grams saturated).

"This breakfast is high in protein, fibre and unsaturated fat, and means you're likely to feel fuller for longer, and also provides a source of calcium, vitamin C, several B vitamins and iron. Starting the day with a breakfast high in protein and fibre can be beneficial in weight loss and weight maintenance," Spendlove said.

"Replacing a healthy, balanced breakfast with bulletproof coffee displaces a lot of important nutrients."

Essentially: bulletproof coffee can be beneficial for those following a ketogenic diet, but for most people following a standard diet, bulletproof coffee is not a balanced way to start the day.0

Sure, someone can fail in politics, but can someone fail out of politics? A person can lose an election, be booted from a committee or sprout fungus from too many decades on the back bench. However, can a person screw up so badly that they aren’t let back in? Are there personae non gratae in the world of governance? Are there proverbial ice floes upon which the truly ostracized are plopped, their phone calls never to be returned again? “I guess if you’ve murdered somebody, I assume that’s a bright line that exists,” mused Liz Mair, a GOP communications consultant. “Short of that, I’m not sure there’s anything you can say, 100 percent, that will kill off somebody’s career.” Spurred on by Roy Moore’s continued competitiveness in the Alabama special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Senate seat ― this despite a mounting number of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, including charges as severe as sexual assaulting a minor ― HuffPost set out to answer a simple question: What on earth do you have to do to become so toxic that you can’t find gainful employment in or around politics? In conversations with disheartened journalists, activists, lobbyists and other political operators, the closest answer that could be found was somewhat less than heartening. Murder … maybe? “Well, there was the politician who said you could do anything as long as you weren’t found in bed with a live boy or a dead girl,” recalled veteran political reporter and commentator Eleanor Clift, paraphrasing former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards (D). Clift cited Bob Packwood, the veteran Oregon Republican senator who was forced to resign in 1995 after 19 women ― some who had worked for him ― accused him of sexual misconduct. Despite being forced out of his seat under threat of expulsion, Packwood soon founded a successful lobbying firm, representing major corporate clients and appearing from time to time at hearings and other notable events in Washington. Mark Leibovich, New York Times Magazine chief national correspondent and author of This Town, this decade’s buzziest anthropological study of Washington, sees a shift in attitudes, but notes that D.C.’s culture of second chances runs deep ― at least for its public figures ― so long as the redeemed person is politically useful. “There has always been the barrel, and there have always been people spending time in it,” said Leibovich of periods of political exile and infamy. “What do you have to do to never emerge from the barrel? It’s a pretty forgiving barrel. The cushion is time.” “I do think it’s an interesting time for barrel sciences,” he added.

Marvin Gentry/Reuters Roy Moore speaks in Vestavia Hills, Alabama, on Nov. 11, 2017.

Indeed, Washington has a dubious history of second acts: Oliver North is now a Fox News contributor; Anthony Weiner ran a viable campaign for mayor; Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) won re-election as a “pro-life” crusader after pressuring his mistress to get an abortion; Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) hiked the Appalachian Trail all the way back to Congress; former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) had a very public episode involving diapers and prostitutes, yet won re-election. While the dynamics of political scandals are certainly changing, whether there’s been a net improvement in how Washington metabolizes bad actors is another question altogether. On the one hand, as nearly everyone interviewed by HuffPost noted, the allegations of sexual misconduct against a number of public officials have prompted a long-overdue reckoning with sexual harassment and assault in politics. On the other hand, the increasing tribalism of today’s politics can distract from any number of sins, providing lifelines to perpetrators who might otherwise have not had a second chance in a pre-Fox News era. There is always a large audience of people ready to believe that the charges against you are politically motivated, so long as you’re willing to toe the line on their politics. It is in this context that cynicism creeps in — that despite the changing times, you still can’t help but wonder if a Russia Today show is entirely out of the question for Anthony Weiner when he gets out of prison. “I think all of politics now is becoming this weird reality TV show where Americans have given up on politics being something noble or something to look up to ― and that’s a rational decision, because it hasn’t been for a long, long time,” observed Sam Geduldig, a prominent Republican lobbyist and erstwhile senior aide to former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). Figures like Moore can “cocoon themselves into a social media sphere that will accept them,” Leibovich noted, citing pro-Trump outlets like Breitbart News. To wit, in the last 12 months, Sebastian Gorka, a man with ties to Hungarian fascists and whose White House tenure could charitably be described as an utter disaster, landed a Fox News contributing gig; Sean Spicer enjoyed a soft landing with a teaching gig at Harvard and a cameo on the Emmys after an institution-damaging tenure as White House press secretary; and Greg Gianforte won a seat in Congress after being arrested for assaulting a reporter. And, of course, Donald Trump, a man who admitted on tape to sexually assaulting women, was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

It’s not clear how many times he’s actually played golf during those visits, as the White House has not released that information. Washington Post national correspondent Philip Bump estimated that Trump played his 64th round of golf as president over the weekend.

President Barack Obama played 29 rounds of golf during his first 12 months in office, and President George W. Bush golfed seven times his first year, according to CBS News.

If Trump keeps golfing at his current rate, he will have played more than 2.5 times more than Obama, and roughly 11 times that of Bush, during their first years.

The steam-based eruptions evolved into magmatic eruptions over the weekend. Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised its alert from orange to red, its highest level, early Monday morning local time, the Associated Press reported. Some 40,000 people were evacuated to temporary shelters over the weekend but another 60,000 would still have to move, officials said. They targeted 224 locations for evacuation and told everyone within six miles of Mount Agung to leave.

Some fear a major eruption could be imminent. But the head of Bali’s geological agency told AP: “We don’t expect a big eruption, but we have to stay alert and anticipate.”

Indonesia’s volcano monitoring center said Sunday that magma had already reached the volcano’s surface, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The last eruption of Mount Agung occurred in 1963 and some 1,000 people were killed after little warning an eruption was about to occur.

Flights were suspended at Bali’s airport at Ngurah Rai, stranding thousands as the volcano erupted three times Saturday and continued on Sunday, Bali’s Regional Disaster Management Agency said. Lombok International Airport on Pulau Lombok also closed, CNN reported.-1

The national youth radio station has counted down listeners' top 100 favourite songs of the previous on January 26 since 1998, bringing it in line with the national public holiday.

However, in recent years Triple J has been under pressure from Indigenous groups and musicians to not hold the celebration on Australia Day, as debate continues as to whether the national holiday should be moved to a date less antagonistic to Australia's first people.

On Monday, Triple J announced how the Hottest 100 would be run in 2018, saying that the countdown would happen on the fourth weekend of January each year instead of the strict January 26 date.

triple j's Hottest 100 is moving to a new date and here's whyhttps://t.co/BwE9JvOlic pic.twitter.com/r3KGnNKPXK November 27, 2017

"It's fair to say there's been increasing debate around 26 January and there are a lot of perspectives on what it means to different Australians. As the public broadcaster representing all Australians, triple j and the ABC doesn't take a view in the discussions," Triple J said in a statement.

"However, in recent years the Hottest 100 has become a symbol in the debate about Australia Day. The Hottest 100 wasn't created as an Australia Day celebration. It was created to celebrate your favourite songs of the past year. It should be an event that everyone can enjoy together – for both the musicians whose songs make it in and for everyone listening in Australia and around the world. This is really important to us.

"Whether you're listening in Busselton, Bundy, Alice or Aspen. From Coober Pedy to Caz's pool, tuning in from a backyard BBQ or streaming from overseas, in the city or on the farm; everyone is invited to join the party."

Triple J shared results from two surveys it had conducted, to find attitudes among listeners to keeping or changing the date of the Hottest 100. Nearly 65,000 fans responded to one survey, with 60 percent saying they supported moving the date, while another smaller survey of 759 people found 55 percent supported a change while 22 percent "don't care either way", while just 24 percent disapproved of a date change.

"Ultimately, our research and your feedback shows that most of you are behind a move for the Hottest 100. For those that don't want the date to move, we have heard you," Triple J wrote.

"We've listened closely to how all of you felt about the Hottest 100 and responded with what's the right choice, right now, that reflects the variety of complicated views. And it's a move backed up by more than those survey results."

Indigenous rapper Briggs, as part of his award-winning duo A.B. Original, has been one of the loudest voices calling for Triple J to reconsider holding the Hottest 100 on Australia Day, and changing the date of Australia Day itself altogether. In a popular 'Like A Version' cover of Paul Kelly's hit 'Dumb Things', he even predicted "the date's changing". On Monday, he marked the news quickly:

To every woman and girl in Australia,

You may have seen the news last Friday that one fifth of the inhabitants of our unquestionably modern country are of the quaint view that we -- females -- are becoming 'too outspoken'.

I hope that sentence plays out in your mind's ear in the voice of infamous grumpy Muppets, Statler and Waldorf (those two old hecklers on the balcony). Maybe it prompts you to laugh out loud dismissively. Perhaps even harrumph.

Harrumph.

But if the news resonates and strikes a chord, manages to get under your skin or stuck in your throat, if it has sunk to the pit of your stomach or is right now boiling in your veins, then this letter is for you. And I'm here to ask a favour.

It's time to speak up, call out and rebel against those one in five Aussies with medieval attitudes, whoever they may be. You -- we -- are not becoming 'too outspoken'.

Honestly, we are just getting started.

In fact, I'd say, for the sake of our daughters, sisters, husbands and sons, it's our duty to speak up and put an end to these antiquated attitudes.

What sort of Australia do we want to live in? What sort of relationships do we want to be a part of?Where do we want to work? Don't we all want to be part of an engaging, reflective and supportive environment?

If one person in every five doesn't want to listen, it is their loss and I for one am happy for them to wallow in their lonely isolationist existence.

So here is my appeal to you, women and girls. Speak up and as loudly as you can. Let your mighty voice reign over boardrooms and ring out across playing fields, set it free on the stage, let it loose in front of cameras and let it barrel down the corridors of power.

The one in five cannot silence you if you don't let them.

This is not a race where women are running against men. We are not competing. This is not a battle. We are not enemies. Gender equality benefits us all.

We have found our voice and, for many, it's a voice that has been silenced and belittled for too long. As women we should never stop reminding each other that our ideas and opinions matter. Our chorus is more than half the universe -- we won't be silent.

Every time you speak out about equality and fairness, your voice is helping to weave a more equal and just and fair society. So don't temper your opinions, embrace them.

Don't let people tell you you're bossy. Instead, keep on being a leader and fight for change.

Don't shy from the limelight or hide your light under a bushel. Instead, shine it brightly and proudly and pave the way for others to shine theirs.

Don't listen to those who suggest you're being hysterical. What's hysterical is their reaction.

Don't let anyone value your body over your incredible mind.

Those archaic, outdated attitudes that seek to hold us back will eventually dissipate and go the way of the dinosaurs, and from their bones a gender-equal world will grow. That's a future I want for our sons and daughters.

Because of the relentless campaigns from organisations like Our Watch, I know that with more gender equality comes less discrimination and violence against women and children. Sexist jokes, attitudes and behaviours create a culture where violence against women flourishes.

So speak up! Accept nothing less than equality. Accept nothing less than the utmost respect.

Never lower the baton handed to us by those brave souls who first spoke for the rights of women, who first raised their voices for our right to do paid work, to drive, to vote, to be heard, to be outspoken; who were -- and in some parts still are -- faced with reprisal, violence, imprisonment and death.

This is not a race where women are running against men. We are not competing. This is not a battle. We are not enemies. Gender equality benefits us all.

Research shows that gender-equal teams make better decisions and are more effective.

Research shows that businesses with gender-equal, diverse boards and senior management are more profitable.

Research shows that when men have access to, and take, parental leave, both workplaces and families reap the rewards.

So, speak and be counted. Speak until your voice is raspy. Speak until all Australians speak with you. Until zero out of five Australians think you're too outspoken, and five out of five stop what they're doing and listen.

Speak up!

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/07/20/how-to-beat-sugar-cravings_a_23038502/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageHow To Beat Sugar CravingsThere's a plethora of reasons why we crave sugar, from stress and lack of sleep, to genetics and sugar's addictive nature. Thankfully there are a number of ways and strategies to help beat sugar cravings.

"We can crave sugar for several reasons, the main reasons being low blood sugar and low energy," nutritionist Fiona Tuck told HuffPost Australia.

"Sugar is used primarily as a fuel or energy source -- the brain relies on glucose to function properly -- so when this gets low we crave more sugar. Poor nutrition, such as a diet high in processed foods and sugar and low in nutrients such as magnesium and chromium, can also lead to sugar cravings."

Reasons why we crave sugar include: High stress levels

Leptin resistance

Low levels of serotonin (the "feel good" hormone)

Low energy or lack of sleep

Hormone changes (e.g. during the premenstrual period)

Sight, sound and smell (e.g. colourful packets of lollies in a bright supermarket)

Sugar can give us a feeling of increased alertness, mood and energy. But when we eat more sugar than our body needs, it gets stored in the body as glycogen as a fuel reserve.

"When glycogen stores are full, the body converts the excess sugar into fat and stores it as adipose tissue," Tuck explained.

"Sugar causes an increase in the hormone insulin, and the more sugar we eat, the more insulin is produced, which can lead to health problems such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes."

How to beat sugar cravings

1. Consume foods high in magnesium, chromium and zinc

"Increase nutrient-dense foods, including magnesium-rich green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds and dark chocolate, and chromium found in whole grains, broccoli, green beans, bran and orange juice," Tuck said.

"These nutrients help improve your cells' sensitivity to insulin to maximise the amount of sugar your body is able to metabolise and burn. A deficiency in these nutrients may lead to sugar cravings," dietitian Robbie Clark told HuffPost Australia.

Foods high in magnesium: green leafy vegetables, fruit, nuts and seeds, legumes, vegetables, seafood, whole grains, raw cacao, dark chocolate, tofu, chlorella powder. Foods high in chromium: broccoli, whole grains, wheat germ, brewer's yeast, bran cereal, orange juice, romaine lettuce, raw onions, potatoes, green beans, bananas, apples, raw tomatoes, black pepper, grape juice. Foods high in zinc: oysters, beef, lamb, spinach, pumpkin seeds, nuts, dark chocolate, pork, chicken, beans, mushrooms.

2. Eat macro-nutrient balanced snacks and meals

For each meal of the day, aim for a balance of macro-nutrients. This will help keep you full for longer and your blood sugar levels more stable, therefore helping to reduce sugar cravings during the day.

"Balancing out blood sugar levels can help. Eat regular meals and include protein, good quality carbs and good fats to maintain satiety and prevent blood sugar crashes," Tuck said.

Eggs (protein), good-quality carbs (rye bread) and healthy fats (avocado).

3. Add spices to your meals and snacks

To help avoid sugar crashes and cravings, add spices like cinnamon to your meals and snacks. Try banana, peanut butter and cinnamon on toast, vegetable curry with Indian spices, and baked pear with cinnamon and nutmeg.

"Cinnamon, cardamom and nutmeg have shown some promise in improving blood sugar control, especially in people with poorly controlled diabetes," Clark said.

4. Manage stress levels

"High stress and cortisol levels can also lead to sugar cravings," Tuck said.

Try 10 minutes of meditation or deep breathing, go for a walk with a friend or family member, take a hot bath, drink herbal tea, and don't forget exercise.

"Combat stress and emotions by exercising regularly. Not only will the exercise improve stress, but it will also boost your energy, which is a major factor why people look to sugar in the first place," Clark said.

Licorice tea is naturally sweet and can help satisfy a sweet craving.

5. Swap sugary junk food for naturally-sweetened alternatives

Instead of store-bought sugary food, make your own banana-sweetened muffins or loaf, colourful fruit salad, or homemade ice cream by blending frozen bananas with a splash of milk. Or try these seven easy, healthy desserts.

"Bake with overripe mashed bananas or unsweetened apple sauce," Clark said. "You could also snack on a few Medjool dates, which are not only naturally sweet but also contain fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants."

While fruit does contain sugar, it also comes with fibre, which is the way to make sugar safe for our bodies.

6. Add extra healthy fats to your meals

If you find you're still craving sugar after eating macro-nutrient balanced meals, Clark suggests to try adding extra healthy fats to your meals.

"Healthy fats such as avocado, extra virgin olive oil, salmon, nuts and seeds provide satiety and they help to keep your blood sugar stable," Clark said.

A handful of nuts can keep you more full than a handful of lollies.

7. Remove temptation

Resisting a block of chocolate which is waiting in the cupboard at home is much harder than simply saying 'no' to it once in the supermarket.

"A major reason why people flock to sugary foods is because it is there, right in front of them, or on the office desk or in the freezer. If you remove these temptations, it will be a case of 'out of sight, out of mind,'" Clark said.

8. Get quality sleep

As insufficient sleep can affect the hormones that control our appetite, a bad night's sleep could be why you're overeating or craving sugar today.

"Get plenty of sleep. When you're tired, your energy levels are lowered which will tempt you to go for sugary options," Clark said.

9. Keep a food diary

In order to understand when and why you experience sugar cravings, Tuck recommends tracking what you eat, as well as your mood and energy levels, and being mindful of these patterns.

"Keep a food diary to monitor patterns so you can start to notice the triggers -- do they come after not eating a balanced meal? When you are tired or stressed?" Tuck said.

"Practise mindfulness by becoming aware of the craving and when they arise."

10. Don't skip meals

For those wanting to lose weight or compensate for a sugary binge, skipping meals can be a tempting idea. However, this can have the opposite effect.

"Don't starve yourself unnecessarily -- going for long periods of time without food may cause your bloods sugar levels to drop. This will promote hunger, and more likely for carbohydrate or sugary foods," Clark said.

"I am happy to say to the people of Australia: this is my story, make up your mind if I'm the most evil person that's ever lived, that's your decision," he said.

"If you can forgive me for the stupidity and the other things I have done then I am very grateful, but I think that's their decision not mine.

"I have looked in the mirror and there's a lot I don't like. But that's up to the people of Australia to decide if they can forgive me or not."

More than 50 people were interviewed for a joint investigation published by the ABC and Fairfax Media on Monday, which included accusations of groping, lewd language, psychological bullying and relentless talk of sex by female employees -- allegations the celebrity gardener has strenuously denied.

In addition to his denial of the allegations Burke has reportedly sought out the services of a leading defamation lawyer who specialises in "reputational risk".

In Monday night's interview, Burke continued to stringently deny the allegations by questioning the memories his accusers have of events from "30 years ago".

"A lot of those words, I think have just grown over the years. Remember this is 30 years ago, a lot of this. Who remembers exactly what happened 30 years ago?" he said.

"What I know is as a person who does have ethics, I know what I will say, what I won't say, what I will do and what I won't do.

"I'm quite confident in all of that and there's plenty of people that were with me through my trip that sort of say, 'well he wasn't like that'."

He also said that the blame for the allegations falls to "the Twittersphere" in light of the recent Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal that has resulted in a "witch hunt" directed towards him.

"I'm guessing it's the social media, the 'Twittersphere' thing. I guess they've stirred this up, there's the Harvey Weinstein thing, and we've got a witch hunt," he said.

"I'm prepared to cop the fact that I might have terrified a few people or whatever and so on, and that I shouldn't have done that and so on, but these sort of things bear no relationship to who I am and what I'm about.

"There are plenty of people from that time at 'Burkes' Backyard' that were there that have come to me and said 'how can they say this?' They're furious. These things didn't happen."

"In part I deserve this, but not for all that sleazy, sexual stuff," says Don Burke. #9ACA | WATCH THE FULL STORY: https://t.co/TJfiooQfHh pic.twitter.com/LSFV0AXoXP — A Current Affair (@ACurrentAffair9) November 27, 2017

In contrast to the ABC and Fairfax investigation, Burke went on to say that in his time working on 'Burke's Backyard' the staff behind the program never received a complaint of harassment or abuse from anyone he worked with.

"No-one, male or female, ever complained about anything -- whether it's bullying, any sexual issues, nothing -- in all the time, there was not one. I'm sort of thinking why now?" he said.

"I might have been a bear with a sore head, particularly towards the end, but it was a robust exchange there, we were all in prime time.

"I don't accept that I was this Weinstein-like figure bullying down on everyone. It was a robust environment and everyone was entitled to put in their two-pence worth."

As part of the joint investigation, former producers of the 'Burke's Backyard' program described working with the TV icon as "an endurance test in terms of his persistence in commentary about anything sexual".

Further to that, as questions are raised over the knowledge Channel Nine executives had of the allegations against Burke, the managing director and CEO of the Nine Network during the 1990s David Leckie astonishingly described him as a "a dreadful, dreadful piece of work" and a "really dirty old man".

"I've been trying to think of Harvey Weinstein-type people [in Australia] and the only one I can ever come up with is Burke," Leckie told the ABC and Fairfax.

On Monday night, the former managing directer of Burke's television production company CTC (Cut The Crap) Productions Michael Freedman also jumped to his defence on the ABC's '7.30' program, saying the company never received any of the allegations made by the ABC/Fairfax report, despite "Don being a difficult man to work with".

"I worked for Don between 1991 and 1998... During that entire time I did not receive one allegation of sexual harassment of any untoward sexual behaviour by Don Burke to any member of staff or any member of the general public," he said.

"I didn't hear any rumours of sexual harassment. There were rumours about Don being a tough task master and Don being a difficult man to work with and some of those things are true. Don sets very high standards -- he sets high standards for himself and he sets high standards for people that work with him.

http://cnn.com/2017/11/26/asia/mount-agung-eruption-bali-indonesia/index.htmlIndonesia volcano: Mount Agung eruption closes Bali's main airportStory highlights Bali's main airport has closed as Mount Agung creates huge ash cloud

Ash cloud reached as high as 9,100 meters (5.6 miles), Australian officials say

Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) Authorities have issued the highest-level warning possible after volcanic eruptions from Mount Agung on the Indonesian resort island of Bali forced the closure of the island's main airport and evacuation of thousands of residents living nearby.

Thick ash started shooting thousands of meters into the air above Mount Agung on Saturday, driving east and southeast along the archipelago, forcing more than 29,000 people to evacuate from their homes, the Bali Provincial Board for Disaster Relief said, revising their initial estimate.

At Ngurah Rai International Airport, Bali's main airport, flights were canceled for 24 hours from 7:15 a.m. Monday local time (6 p.m. Sunday ET), stranding roughly 59,000 domestic and international passengers, according to the airport's latest report.

"While the sun is shining and there is little sign of volcanic ash in the southern regions of Bali, evidence of volcanic ash at higher altitudes on aviation approach and departure paths has prompted the decision to close the airport," Bali Tourism Board Chairman Ida Bagus Agung Partha Adnyana said in a statement.

Balinese Hindus pray near Mount Agung in hope of preventing a volcanic eruption Saturday.

The National Agency for Disaster Management issued a Level 4 alert on Monday, indicating the potential for another larger eruption and recommending no public activities within 8 to 10 kilometers from the peak.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/26/media/new-york-times-nazi-sympathizer-next-door/index.htmlNew York Times says it regrets offense caused by 'Nazi sympathizer next door' storyA New York Times editor on Sunday said the paper regrets how much a controversial article about a white nationalist offended readers.

The memo, written by national editor Marc Lacey, was an attempt to address backlash to a piece posted online Saturday. It describes an Ohio man as "the Nazi sympathizer next door."

"We regret the degree to which the piece offended so many readers," Lacey wrote. "We recognize that people can disagree on how best to tell a disagreeable story. What we think is indisputable, though, is the need to shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life and the people who inhabit them."

He continued: "That's what the story, however imperfectly, tried to do."

The story describes the everyday life of Tony Hovater, a man who identifies as a white nationalist. It discusses his wife, his "innocuous pop-culture" tattoos and a love for TV comedies like "Seinfeld."

The piece was criticized by people who called it an attempt to "normalize" white nationalism and other extremist ideologies.

Quartz culture editor Indrani Sen said the story lacked "any explanation to the reader of why exactly this story exists, and what the writer expects the reader to glean from it."

"Without that we have, essentially, a puff piece about a Nazi sympathizer," Sen wrote.

Lacey offered an explanation in his memo.

"The point of the story was not to normalize anything but to describe the degree to which hate and extremism have become far more normal in American life than many of us want to think," he wrote.

He also said the article refers to Hovater as a "bigot" and a "Nazi sympathizer who posted images on Facebook of a Nazi-like America full of happy white people and swastikas everywhere."

Lacey added that editors and the story's author, Times reporter Richard Fausset, "agonized over the tone and content of the article."

Fausset also wrote a 700-word column that described his reporting process. It was published Saturday alongside the original article.

"There is a hole at the heart of my story," he wrote. "Sometimes a soul, and its shape, remain obscure to both writer and reader. I beat myself up about all of this for a while, until I decided that the unfilled hole would have to serve as both feature and defect."

Asked for additional comment, a Times spokesperson directed CNNMoney to Lacey's memo.

Hovater did not respond to a request for comment.

Charlie Warzel, a BuzzFeed reporter who writes about online culture, published a response to the Times piece Sunday. He suggested that some corners of the internet might explain Horvater's point of view.

"The Times piece does little to describe the online ecosystem that has helped white nationalists, neo-Nazis and the Alt-Right organize, amplify its message, and thrive in recent years," Warzel wrote. "And, simply put, any attempt to answer what exactly led Hovater to 'gravitate toward the furthest extremes of American political discourse' is incomplete without it."

Not everyone was so critical. Ira Glass, the host and producer of the popular radio show "This American Life," said the article "captured something real and worth documenting."

"Yes, the reporter could've argued with him more," Glass tweeted. "On our show we'd have done that. But I think it wouldn't change the overall story here very much."-1

Located 20 minutes' walk from the beach, the hotel's nine apartment-style villas, made entirely from wood, stone and glass and outfitted with breezy outdoor pavilions and 45-foot-long private swimming pools, are the epitome of zen.

Though each has its own kitchen -- stocked with food upon request -- one of the hotel highlights is its Japanese restaurant, Shiro , which serves up some of the best sushi on the island.

1. Pope in Myanmar

Pope Francis arrived in Myanmar this morning. Francis, the first pope to ever visit the nation, will be focused on the Rohingya crisis . The Pope has previously decried the unspeakable violence against the Rohingya and referred to them as his persecuted "brothers and sisters." But he's been advised not to say the word 'Rohingya' out of fear that could start anti-Muslim protests in staunchly Buddhist Myanmar. The ethnic group is not a recognized minority in the country. The government, instead, refers to them as "Bengalis," and claims they are illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh.

2. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

There's a political fight brewing at the nation's consumer watchdog agency, but, please, don't scroll down to the next item. What happens with the CFPB is actually pretty important. Richard Cordray, the agency's director, resigned last week and named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as the acting director. But then President Trump named Mick Mulvaney, who's already running the Office of Management and Budget, as the CFPB's acting director. English is suing to stop that.

The CFPB oversees financial institutions and protects consumers from financial fraud . It's also not popular at all with Trump, Republicans or Wall Street, so that may explain why the administration seems to want to get its hands on it. Mulvaney himself has been one of CFPB's biggest critics, saying it creates burdensome regulations. So will there be a showdown this morning? It's unclear, but Mulvaney's team expects there will be a normal transition.

Upside down0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/27/politics/cfpb-explainer-leadership-dispute/index.htmlWhat's going on at the CFPB?(CNN) Over the holiday weekend, a scramble over who's in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been unfolding.

Richard Cordray, the director of the CFPB, a consumer watchdog agency, resigned Friday and named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director, essentially establishing her as the bureau's acting director. But shortly after, President Trump named Mick Mulvaney as CFPB's acting director.

The two conflicting appointments sparked confusion over who will be in charge when employees return to work Monday.

What is the CFPB? What do they do?

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is tasked with overseeing financial institutions, monitoring markets and protecting consumers from financial fraud.

Inspired by Sen. Elizabeth Warren , the CFPB was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law as a way to safeguard Americans from predatory lending that hurt many before the 2008 financial meltdown.

Created during the Obama administration, the CFPB has since established itself as a powerful regulator, taking on institutions like big banks and payday lenders. The Wells Fargo scandal involving phony accounts helped burnish the CFPB's watchdog brand. While the CFPB didn't uncover the trouble at Wells Fargo, the agency's $100 million fine packed a punch and sent a message to banks.

Who is in charge?

That's the big question right now.

Cordray was CFPB's first chief, having served since his 2012 appointment by Obama. His resignation last week was welcome news for Republicans, who have long loathed Cordray. But his departure may have more to do with his personal political aspirations than GOP pressure. Cordray is widely thought to be preparing a 2018 run for governor of Ohio.

In his resignation letter to staff, Cordray announced that English will serve as the bureau's acting director.

But shortly after Cordray's announcement, Trump named Mulvaney, who is the Office of Management and Budget director,as the CFPB's interim director.

These back-to-back moves set the question of who is in charge of the agency.

What's happening now?

Both sides are citing different rules to make their claims for the interim director's role.

Lawyers for English filed a lawsuit Sunday in the US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to halt Mulvaney's appointment. In their court filing, her attorneys argue English is entitled to the position under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that says the deputy director becomes acting director when the agency's top spot is vacant.

"The President's attempt to install a White House official at the head of independent agency -- while allowing that officer to simultaneously serve in the White House -- is unprecedented," said English's lawyer, Deepak Gupta, of the law firm Gupta Wessler, in the statement on Sunday. "The law is clear: Ms. English is acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until the Senate confirms a new director."

The White House acknowledged that it was aware of English's lawsuit Sunday, but also maintained that the law is on its side.

"Director Mulvaney is the Acting Director of the CFPB," said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders in a statement. "Now that the CFPB's own General Counsel -- who was hired under Richard Cordray -- has notified the Bureau's leadership that she agrees with the Administration's and DOJ's reading of the law, there should be no question that Director Mulvaney is the Acting Director."

It's unclear yet how the lawsuit will impact the situation.

Who's for and against the CFPB?

Given that the agency was formed during the Obama administration, the CFPB has broad support from Democrats, especially from Warren, who brought up the idea in a paper she wrote when she was a law professor at Harvard.

She weighed in on Twitter, touting CFPB's achievements as having returned "$12 billion to working families who were cheated. That's government that works for the people."

The only thing that will turn the @CFPB into a disaster is for @realDonaldTrump to ignore Dodd-Frank & name an acting director determined to destroy the agency. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 25, 2017

CFPB's supporters say the agency plays a key role in preventing big business from preying on the little guy.

JUST WATCHED Senate repeals big bank arbitration clause Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senate repeals big bank arbitration clause 01:47

But critics, including Wall Street and most Republicans, say the CFPB is the epitome of government overreach and wields too much power. The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group that represents retail banks, said in a statement Saturday that "the CFPB's current governing structure is a dictatorship, period."

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton blasted the CFPB as a "rogue, unconstitutional agency."

"Leandra English's lawsuit to install herself as acting director against the president's explicit direction is just the latest lawless action by the CFPB. She doesn't have a legal leg to stand on," he said in a statement. He said English and anyone who "disobeys Director Mulvaney's orders should also be fired summarily."

Mulvaney has also been a major critic of the CFPB. While serving in Congress, he voted in favor of killing the agency and has argued that it places unduly harsh regulations. Critics see Cordray's resignation as chance to remake the CFPB.

What happens next?

Mulvaney and his team are not expecting a showdown at the agency Monday morning, a source close to the Office of Management and Budget director told CNN. They view Mulvaney's appointment as something that the Justice Department, consumer agency lawyers and staff agree upon and expect a normal transition, the source said.

Moreover, Trump has the authority to nominate a permanent leader for the CFPB. That nominee will need to be confirmed by the Senate -- where he or she will undoubtedly face Warren.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/26/politics/preet-bharara-michael-flynn-special-counsel/index.htmlBharara: 'Substantial likelihood' Flynn lawyers are in discussions on cooperating in Mueller probeWashington (CNN) Former US attorney Preet Bharara said Sunday that it's likely President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is in discussions with special counsel Robert Mueller about cooperating with his investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.

"My view is based on how things used to operate in my office and based on how the world works, (which) is that there's a substantial likelihood that they're at least in discussions with regard to cooperating," Bharara said on CNN's "State of the Union."

Asked if the President should be worried about the possibility that Flynn is cooperating with Mueller's team, Bharara said: "It depends on what the President has done and what the President's conversations with Michael Flynn and others have been.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/27/investing/bitcoin-price-new-high/index.htmlBitcoin's incredible surge takes it above $9,500The great bitcoin boom of 2017 is going from strength to strength.

The virtual currency rocketed above $9,000 for the first time on Sunday and was trading above $9,500 by Monday morning in Asia.

Stock markets around the world have been on a tear this year, but their gains are paltry compared with bitcoin's. The digital currency, which only rose above $8,000 about a week ago, has surged an incredible 860% since the start of the year.

Despite skepticism from some top finance executives about bitcoin's rise, experts say the latest gains appear to have been fueled by expectations that big professional investors -- such as hedge funds and asset managers -- could soon pour money into the currency.

Even a small portion of the cash managed by major funds "would make a dramatic impact on the bitcoin market," said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong bitcoin exchange Gatecoin.

Related: What is bitcoin?

The cryptocurrency has been gaining more legitimacy in some parts of the financial industry.

From early next month, investors should be able to trade bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is likely to help bolster the currency's reputation among mainstream investors. Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies, metals and agricultural commodities.

The backing of a major exchange is encouraging institutional investors "to dip their toes into the bitcoin market," Glucksmann said. He expects more professional investors to put money into it if it breaches $10,000.

Related: Can anything stop bitcoin?

The virtual currency has famously attracted the derision of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who called it a "fraud" that would "eventually blow up." But other leading figures in finance, including Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein have defended it.

Shane Chanel, an adviser at investment firm ASR Wealth Advisers, predicts bitcoin will hit $12,000 within the next six months.

"Greed will continue to drive the price over the short term," he said. But he warned that any setbacks in the introduction of bitcoin futures over the next few weeks could prompt a "dramatic short-term tumble."

Bitcoin's path toward $9,500 hasn't been smooth. It's suffered periods of major volatility along the way.

Related: Bitcoin splits in two, here's what that means

In September, it plunged as much as 20% after the Chinese government cracked down on offerings in the digital currency, prompting bitcoin exchanges to close their doors.

Earlier this month, it plummeted by up to 30% within the space of a few days, before quickly bouncing back, after it appeared traders were switching to rival cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies are virtual "coins" that are "mined" by computers completing complex algorithms. Bitcoin is the most famous and widely used one.0
http://time.com/money/5033848/6-american-work-habits-other-countries-avoid/?xid=homepage6 Work Habits Americans Have That Other Countries Avoid at All CostsThe way Americans work has people in other countries scratching their heads.

Although people in the United States are known for working hard — and much longer than those in other countries — workplaces abroad have largely shunned the American style.

Here are the most unhealthy American work habits that global workplaces are resisting.

Americans work crazy long hours

Hero Images—Getty Images/Hero Images

Perhaps the most notorious habit of American workers is their tendency to work long hours.

A Gallup report from 2014 estimated that the average full-time worker in the United States works 47 hours a week, one of the highest figures in the world, and significantly higher than the rates in Western Europe.

For example, in Europe, the Working Time Directive gives employees in the European Union the right to work no more than 48 hours a week. In practice, employees in some countries, like Germany and Sweden, work closer to 35 hours a week, according to Cary Cooper, an American-born professor at Manchester Business School in the United Kingdom.

Craig Storti, author of “Communicating Across Cultures,” said Europeans consider the typical American workload an ineffective use of time.

“Europeans see that as being inefficient,” Storti told Business Insider. “They say, ‘You should have finished that in the allotted time.'”

They hardly ever go on vacation

Vacation time varies from country to country, but Americans seem to get the short end of the stick, with most companies offering around two weeks of paid leave a year.

And what little vacation time Americans do receive, they don’t always take advantage of.

According to the careers website Glassdoor, the average US employee who receives paid vacation only actually takes 54% of the allotted time each year.

Compare to that to a country like Sweden, where workers get five weeks of paid vacation a year, and it’s no surprise that they reject the American system.

“American companies aren’t looking at the evidence of the important of holidays, in terms of productivity afterwards,” Cooper told Business Insider, who said burnout was a much bigger problem in the US than in other places. “You can’t continue to work without many breaks during the year.”

And they barely take any family leave, either

Hero Images—Getty Images/Hero Images

The United States doesn’t guarantee any paid leave to new parents, instead leaving it up to individual employers.

The result is new parents take far less time off after having a child than other parents around the world. That’s largely due to cultural stigma — women can be seen as prioritizing home life above all else, while men can be seen as being less serious about their careers.

But it’s not that way everywhere. In Finland, for example, expecting mothers can start their leave seven weeks before having a child, and can continue for 16 weeks after the birth. Men in Finland are offered eight weeks of paid leave.

Americans tend to eat at their desks

Americans have a reputation for being chained to their desks, and the statistics seem to back it up.

A 2015 survey found that only one in five Americans actually spends their lunch break away from their desks, with most eating their midday meal while they continue to work.

On top of that, millions of Americans are skipping lunch altogether to continue working.

Meanwhile, in France, Spain, Greece, and other countries, lunch breaks can last an hour or more — and rarely take place in front of a computer screen.

Americans seldom take breaks during the day

Even outside of lunchtime hours, American workers rarely step outside for a break.

Meanwhile, in Sweden, workers often enjoy a daily breather called fika— an extended coffee break during which employees can gather and socialize. Many offices offer two breaks, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

Studies have shown that taking breaks throughout the day help us increase creativity, regain our focus, and retain information.

And they send emails after work hours

Westend61—Getty Images/Westend61

One of the worst American work practices, in the eyes of foreigners, is the tendency to send and answer emails after work hours have ended.

In other cultures, there is more of a distinction between work life and personal life, and the two rarely bleed into each other, Storti said. And France took that to extreme measures, enacting a measure earlier this year that allows employees to ignore work-related emails sent after working hours.

“In Europe, they give 100% from 9 to 5. When they go home, that’s it, they’re finished. They resent being contacted late.”

The same goes for weekend emails — even ones that are sent without the expectation the recipient will respond right away.

“When they come in Monday and see you emailed them on Sunday, they’re going to be annoyed by that,” he said. “The perception is Americans, they don’t stop working.”

Trading houses and manufacturing names made losses, but some notable names continued to cling to gains. Toyota closed up 0.04 percent as other major automakers finished the session lower. Tech stocks ended mixed, with Nintendo closing up 2.38 percent on investor optimism following reports that Black Friday and Thanksgiving deals in the U.S. had brought in solid sales.

Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi fell 1.44 percent to end at 2,507.81, with tech stocks dragging on the broader index. Market movers included SK Hynix and LG Display which lost 2.35 percent and 1.44 percent respectively by the end of the day.

Samsung Electronics tumbled 5.08 percent by the close after a Morgan Stanley report downgraded the stock to "equal weight" from "overweight" and lowered its price target to 2.8 million won per share, Reuters reported.

The Korean won was also in focus ahead of the Bank of Korea's Thursday interest rates decision, with a majority of economists polled by Reuters last month indicating that a 25 basis point rate hike was expected. The currency traded at 1,089.31 won to the dollar, near its strongest levels in around two and a half years.

Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 inched higher by 0.1 percent to close at 5,988.77 after flatlining earlier in the session. Resource plays Rio Tinto and BHP seesawed, closing the session lower by 0.01 percent and 0.07 percent respectively. Energy-related stocks were downbeat, with Santos falling 0.79 percent.

Greater China equities slid as markets continued to focus on the rise in bond yields on the mainland. The Shanghai Composite lost 0.92 percent to close at 3,322.83 and the Shenzhen Composite fell 1.56 percent to end at 1,892.82, with telcos and tech among the worst-performing sectors.

His government's position, which he says all Irish political parties agree on, is that no hard border should be established and that a customs union be maintained between the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Irish province, with whom it has crucial trade ties.

"We're putting this position forward because we believe it is in the national interest of Ireland and it offers the best prospect for continued economic progress and stability on our island," Donohoe said.

"The reason why we believe it is very very important that we have a customs policy moving forward, that is as close as possible to what we have at the moment, including maybe membership of the customs union or a customs policy equivalent to it, is that it offers the best possible prospects to the continued maintenance of trade on our island," he continued.

The customs union, a cornerstone of the EU, exempts all EU member states and select outside territories from paying customs duties on all goods traveling within the union. This has saved huge costs for businesses over time and enabled quicker movement of goods.

Ireland now fears that the U.K.'s likely departure from the customs union will both damage the two countries' 65 billion euro ($77.5 billion) annual trade market, but also reimpose a hard border between itself and the U.K. province of Northern Ireland after two decades of open borders and a delicate peace.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/26/dimon-wrong-on-bitcoin-says-uae-sovereign-fund-chief.htmlDimon wrong on bitcoin, says UAE sovereign fund chiefThe chief executive of one of the world's largest sovereign funds has said that he doesn't believe bitcoin is a "fraud."

Khaldoon Al Mubarak, who heads Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company, said he was "still on the fence" with regard to bitcoin and blockchain technology, but that people should look at both with an open mind.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has previously called the cryptocurrency a "fraud" that will eventually "blow up."

Asked whether he agreed with Dimon's view, Al Mubarak said: "No. I wouldn't agree in calling it a fraud. I would say time will tell. It could well be (a fraud) and it could as well not be. I think one has to be open-minded."

Although the state-backed wealth fund's boss did not yet have a "clear view" on blockchain — the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin — he said that his biggest concern was around regulation.

"I think blockchain, its growth, from the single digits, early double-digits, to astronomical growth, will really depend on how fast you can execute and where you're going to be able to execute under a regulatory environment that is acceptable," he said.

"If they're able to crack that, I think it's going to be an incredible story. But, to date, I would say I'm still on the fence."0

Here's 9 ways to save your career — and your healthEvery worker can have an off day, but when employees lose their ability to engage, the warning signs of occupational burnout can often arise.

According to Tim Cole, the CEO and founder of consulting firm The Compass Alliance, there are four phases of burnout, which he dubs "the burn-out cycle."

Stage one: Loss of purpose (No longer embracing the job role)

Loss of purpose (No longer embracing the job role) Stage two: Loss of direction (Occupation no longer makes sense)

Loss of direction (Occupation no longer makes sense) Stage three: Full loss of engagement (No longer wants to work in that role)

Full loss of engagement (No longer wants to work in that role) Stage four: Full burnout (As Cole puts it: "the career equivalent of the walking zombie")

Stress in the workplace is far from unheard of. In a recent study, the U.S. National Safety Council discovered that 97 percent of Americans surveyed admitted that they had at least one of nine leading risk factors linked to fatigue, including working unusual hours, dealing with long commutes, and working over 50 hours a week.

In fact, 44 percent admitted to having trouble focusing at work, while over half felt less productive; highlighting that fatigued employees could not only make errors at work, but put themselves and others at risk too.

"The challenge for most is not in surviving their job – it's in establishing a balance emotionally, spiritually, physically, and mentally in their life," Cole told CNBC over email.-1

Harry, 33, Queen Elizabeth's grandson and fifth-in-line to the British throne, and Markle, 36, best known for her role in the U.S. TV legal drama "Suits", got engaged earlier this month in London.

"Prince Harry has informed Her Majesty The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince Harry has also sought and received the blessing of Ms Markle's parents," a statement issued by Prince Charles said.

The queen, who had to give her assent for the union, and her husband Prince Philip are delighted, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said.

Harry and Markle, who is a divorcee, met in July 2016 after they were introduced through friends.

The prince, the youngest son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and his first wife Princess Diana, publicly confirmed their relationship months later in a rebuke to the media over its alleged intrusion into Markle's private life.

But it was not until September that they made their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games in Toronto, a sports event for wounded veterans.

"We're in love," Markle told Vanity Fair magazine that month. "I'm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time.

The couple are due to appear together for the media later on Monday and a broadcast interview will also be aired.

"This is a time of huge celebration and excitement for two people in love and, on behalf of myself, the government and the country, I wish them great happiness for the future," British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter.0
http://www.cnbc.com/advertorial/2017/11/08/the-business-of-a-better-world.htmlThe business of a better worldWhy top corporations are working toward a more sustainable future and how more can be encouraged to follow suit.

Announced in 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) are a far-reaching series of initiatives aimed at eradicating poverty, addressing climate change, and creating more peaceful, equal, educated and inclusive societies worldwide by 2030. While this is a United Nations program, it's not solely governments that are backing the UNSDGs — corporations are also throwing their weight behind these important objectives.

One group mustering corporate support for the UNSDGs is the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. This organisation of more than 200 leading companies including Apple, BMW, Bridgestone, Coca-Cola, Ford, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, and Yokogawa, is dedicated to shaping a more sustainable world, guided by the UNSDGs. Member companies have committed to achieving these ambitious aims, in addition to the anti-climate change goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Coca-Cola, for instance, has made great strides in terms of water stewardship (with 221 billion litres of water replenished through community and watershed projects internationally in 2016) and waste prevention (last year, 60% of bottles and cans, relative to what the company introduced into the market, were recovered and recycled or refilled with the company's support). Apple, meanwhile, now relies predominantly on cleaner, renewable energy sources and uses 99% recycled and responsibly sourced paper in its packaging. 100% of energy used at its data centres and 96% of energy at its facilities worldwide are drawn from sources such as hydro-electric, solar and wind power.

Fellow member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Yokogawa Electric Corporation — a leader in advanced industrial instruments, automated control technology, and digital control and data analysis solutions — has identified three key areas where it feels it can add greatest value in furthering the UNSDGs.

1. Tackle climate change by working toward net-zero emissions, via accelerated use of renewable energy and more efficient use of energy.

2. Speed the transition to a circular economy, where resources are circulated without waste, and assets (including safe drinking water) are utilised more effectively.

3. Increase the population's wellbeing and quality of life by creating safer, cleaner workplaces, promoting human resource development and employment creation in local communities where Yokogawa and its partners are present, and foster greater diversity and inclusion.2

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union caught a break when the Social Democratic Party (SPD) stepped up to the plate after coalition talks with the Free Democratic Party and Greens fell through. SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party would begin talks with Merkel, although he asserted that a final decision would depend on party members.

Elsewhere, Ireland faced its own crisis after a motion of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald — part of the minority Fine Gael government — over a whistle blowing controversy.

Meanwhile, Brexit continues to remain in focus in the U.K. Most recently, Ireland's EU commissioner warned that Dublin could potentially veto Brexit trade talks if a decision is not made on the Northern Irish border. Dublin is looking for assurance that there will not be a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K.

Also of note are Saudi Arabia, which is currently involved in an ongoing tussle for influence with Iran in the Middle East, and the U.S., where the Trump administration is struggling to cement any landmark legislation despite a GOP majority in both houses of Congress.-1

CNBC recently sat down with one ethereum's co-founders for CNBC's "Life Hacks Live," during which he shared his ideas on his career and leadership.

Joe Lubin, one of the eight co-founders of the blockchain-based ethereum platform, had this to say about the technology's primary found: "Vitalik Buterin is relatively ego-free ... He focuses on the facts and circumstances in each situation."

"[Buterin] does a really good job sourcing input from many different classes of actors in the space," Lubin said. "He weighs that input as well as he can and makes decisions when he feels like he's heard as many voices as is necessary."

Lubin said he was satisfied with the way the team worked together, but said it wasn't launched without some issues along the way — as would be expected.

"But the overarching goals that we all held for the project, decentralization in general, has enabled us to work effectively and keep us in sync," he said.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/singapore-changi-airport-new-terminal-4-automation.htmlWe got through a new airport terminal without speaking to a single human (almost)When the world's top-ranked airport opens a new terminal, you can bet expectations are pretty high.

Singapore's Changi Airport spent more than two years constructing it's long-awaited Terminal 4, which cost nearly $1 billion. The new terminal opened for business on October 31st.

The idea behind the world's highest-ranked airport is "fast and seamless travel," so CNBC checked out the new section to see how well it worked.

Here's what we noticed:

1) Automation is everywhere

While passenger check-in kiosks are far from novel, this new terminal has them everywhere. Unlike many check-in areas at airports, in which kiosks compliment counters with human-personnel, Terminal 4 has humans out of sight. Eventually, we found a few personnel working behind a counter, it's clear the airport prefers all passengers stick to checking in themselves through kiosks.

2) Even baggage-drop is automated

There are kiosks that handle checked luggage. The design allows passengers to easily drop their heavy bags into the conveyor belt section without having to lift them very high.

3) The Wi-Fi isn't so easy to use

At some airports, passengers simply log-in by supplying a name and contact info, but at Changi's Terminal 4, passengers are asked to scan their passport into a kiosk and then receive a code that entitles them to one hour of Wi-Fi.0

Zack Schwartz, co-founder of MoreMate, a social and dating location-based app, is still on that first part of the journey. Nevertheless, he's found a way to live in one of the world's most expensive cities — but it's not easy.

While his team is based in Bangkok, the American expatriate moved to Hong Kong in an effort to meet new investors.

"I have a lot of friends and meet a lot of people who say, 'Wow that's so cool what you're doing,'" he said referring to his life as an entrepreneur.

But looks can be deceiving, he admits.

"I can't even go out to see a friend, because I'm afraid that splitting dinner with them is too much money for me," he said.

His start-up is young and the little income it generates is put back into the business, meaning his personal income is minimal.

http://www.cnbc.com/advertorial/2017/11/22/the-global-race-to-cashless-is-underway.htmlThe global race to cashless is underwayThe world is moving on from cash. Globally, the number of non-cash transactions reached 433.1 billion in 2015, a record growth of 11.2%. The U.S. leads the way, followed by the Eurozone and China, according to Capgemini and BNP Paribas' latest World Payments Report.

Another data crunch earlier this year ranked the world's top 20 economies on their credentials as "cashless societies", with Canada topping the list, closely followed by Sweden, the United Kingdom, France and the U.S.

In the cashless world, governments are able to reduce costs, tackle corruption, boost tax revenues and even throttle cash-reliant black economies such as drug dealing; small businesses are able to grow customer base and income through innovative e-payment options, set up new revenue streams such as recurring payments and in doing so, increasing credibility. For individuals, e-payments can offer convenient, easier, more secure options to buy what they want or need, as well as provide services such as money transfers through text message, even if they're "unbanked".

Asia's inclusion in the cashless society rankings starts at sixth place thanks to China, but others in the region lag far behind. However, rapid change is afoot in 2017.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/21/cbs-fires-charlie-rose-after-sexual-misconduct-allegations.htmlCBS fires Charlie Rose, PBS cuts ties with TV host amid sexual misconduct allegationsCBS and PBS severed ties with journalist Charlie Rose Tuesday amid allegations of sexual misconduct.

Rose hosted the interview program "Charlie Rose," which aired on PBS and Bloomberg. He was also a co-host of "CBS This Morning" and a contributing correspondent on CBS' "60 Minutes."

CBS News President David Rhodes detailed the decision to fire Rose in an internal memo:

"A short time ago we terminated Charlie Rose's employment with CBS News, effective immediately. This followed the revelation yesterday of extremely disturbing and intolerable behavior said to have revolved around his PBS program. Despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organization, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace—a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work. We need to be such a place. I've often heard that things used to be different. And no one may be able to correct the past. But what may once have been accepted should not ever have been acceptable. CBS News has reported on extraordinary revelations at other media companies this year and last. Our credibility in that reporting requires credibility managing basic standards of behavior. That is why we have taken these actions. Let's please remember our obligations to each other as colleagues. We will have human resources support today and every day, and we are organizing more personal and direct training which you will hear about from senior management shortly. I'm deeply disappointed and angry that people were victimized—and that even people not connected with these events could see their hard work undermined. If all of us commit to the best behavior and the best work – that is what we can be known for."

PBS spokeswoman Jennifer Byrne confirmed later Tuesday that the network had also terminated its relationship with Rose.

"In light of yesterday's revelations, PBS has terminated its relationship with Charlie Rose and cancelled distribution of his programs. PBS expects all the producers we work with to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect," Byrne said in a statement.

CBS, PBS and Bloomberg originally suspended Rose on Monday after a Washington Post report detailed multiple alleged sexual harassment incidents perpetrated by the journalist.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/mahindra-president-supports-tax-cutsseeking-to-expand-in-the-us.htmlIndian automaker Mahindra, eager to expand in US, hopes for corporate tax cutsIndian automaker Mahindra Group is opening an automotive manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, promising to bring dozens of jobs to the metro-Detroit area.

With ambitions to build a more substantial and trusted presence in the U.S., Mahindra U.S. President Mani Iyer expressed full support of President Donald Trump's economic agenda, and dismissed concerns that U.S. withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement would harm business as usual.

As an American subsidiary, the company stands to benefit from a corporate tax cut. Iyer promised the company would invest any money saved back into the economy.

"With the money, we would like to hire more people, put more dealers, create more jobs in the local communities, give it back to the community," Iyer said on CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. "We do a lot of corporate responsibility initiatives, so all of this helps us to give back to the us economy."

When asked about whether corporate tax cuts would translate into increased wages, he said the company would invest in "skill development and training development, as well as adding more people and investing across centers in the U.S."

Although Mahindra Group is a major producer of pickup trucks, SUVs and commercial vehicles in India, in the U.S., it is known mostly for its tractors. The company ranks third in tractor production nationwide, but has expressed ambitions to begin producing on-road automobiles in the U.S. and globally.

Iyer didn't seem to think the U.S. pulling out of NAFTA would impact Mahindra's business in the U.S., emphasizing that since the company mostly exports products to Mexico, rather than importing supplies or completed vehicles, they wouldn't be subject to any damaging duties.0

Queen Elizabeth’s grandson Harry, 33, currently fifth-in-line to the British throne, and Markle, 36, best known for her role in the TV legal drama “Suits,” got secretly engaged earlier this month.

While people across Britain and around the world sent in messages of congratulations, the news prompted questions from many others. Here’s what we know about the marriage so far: Will we get a day off? The day of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding - April 29, 2011 - was made a public holiday. The-then prime minister, David Cameron, announced the official day off just one week after the pair revealed their engagement, in November 2010. Similarly, a national holiday was held on July 29, 1981, for the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana. There was no public holiday for the wedding of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. When asked if Prime Minister Theresa May will order a Bank Holiday to celebrate, a spokesman replied: “I haven’t discussed that with her.” Nonetheless, a lot of people are asking about it already:

When will it happen? According to the official statement from Clarence House, the pair will wed in Spring 2018, although no specific date has been given. Kate accepted William’s proposal in October 2010, with the news becoming public the following month. They announced their wedding date of April 29 on November 23, exactly a week after revealing their engagement. Where will it happen? While this hasn’t yet been announced, most senior royals marry at Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral or the chapel at Windsor Castle. The couple are then expected to move into Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, next door to William and Kate. William and Kate tied the knot at Westminster Abbey, while Diana and Charles were married at St Paul’s Cathedral. For his second marriage, Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles at Windsor Guildhall.

What will they wear? There’s no official word yet, but if precedent is anything to go by, Kate’s bridal gown was designed by Sarah Burton, the creative director of Alexander McQueen. Markle has been variously spotted in Aquazzura, Aritzia, Antonio Berardi, Burberry and Mulberry. Speaking to Glamour magazine earlier this year, Markle admitted: “I love Victoria Beckham dresses, but I don’t have the long torso to support that silhouette.”

Who will be best man? Prince Harry was his brother’s best man so it’s likely the pair will swap roles. Kate’s sister Pippa was her maid of honour. Markle’s best friend is Markus Anderson, a consultant for the Soho House Group who reportedly introduced her to the prince in July 2016. Markle and Anderson holidayed together in Madrid in August last year and he is often featured on her Instagram account so it’s possible he could play a prominent part in the wedding. Who are the in-laws? Harry’s father is Prince Charles, who married his stepmother Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005. Charles’ first wife and Harry and William’s mother Diana, died in a Paris car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi, 15 years after their fairytale wedding and a year after they were divorced.

Markle’s parents Thomas Markle, 73, and Doria Ragland, 61, met on the set of a TV show in California. Markle, a lighting director for soaps and sitcoms and Ragland, a clinical therapist, split when their daughter was six. In a warning to the media last year, Harry referred to the sexism and racism directed at Markle, whose father is white and her mother African-American. Is it unusual for a royal to marry a divorcee? Historically, royals have not been allowed to marry divorcees. Markle was previously married to film producer Trevor Engelson and they divorced in 2013. If Harry and Meghan wish to marry in a church, they will require a special wedding license from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1955 the Queen’s sister Princess Margaret hoped to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend, a divorced war hero and former equerry to her father, George VI. Upon being told she would have to renounce her rights of succession in order to go through with the wedding, the relationship was called off, with the princess releasing a statement which read: “Mindful of the Church’s teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.”

Previous to that, there was the abdication crisis of 1936, when Harry’s great-great uncle Edward VIII sought to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Upon announcing his intention to marry Simpson to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, a constitutional crisis was provoked. Baldwin felt the marriage could not be allowed if Edward was to remain on the throne, as at the time the Church of England refused to marry divorcees while their former spouse was still living. Edward signed the abdication papers five days later, reigning for just 326 days. The Queen’s father, thus became George VI. “You must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love,” Edward said in his abdication speech.

However in 2005 the Queen, in her role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, gave her permission for Charles to marry fellow divorcee Camilla Parker Bowles. Though she and Prince Philip did not attend the civil ceremony, they were witnesses to the marriage’s blessing and a reception was held for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle. Though divorce was once considered unfathomable in the royal family, of Elizabeth’s four children, three of their marriages have ended in divorce. Will she become a Princess? She won’t – only those born into the royal family – such as Princess Charlotte for instance - can use the titles Prince or Princess. It’s rumoured that once married, the couple will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. According to Vogue, the dukedom to be awarded to Harry has not been filled since 1843. Another possible title for Markle will be HRH Princess Henry of Wales. Will she need a visa? As a non-European national, Markle must obtain a visa if she wishes to be married in the UK. She will need a Family Visa if she hopes to live in the UK with Harry for more than six months. A decision can take up to 12 weeks, though there is a premium same day service for those who apply in the UK in person. Fees vary between £993 for postal or online applications, to £1,464 for applications from outside of the UK and £1,583 for the premium service. No word on whether the fee will be waived on this occasion...

The steam-based eruptions evolved into magmatic blasts over the weekend. Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised its alert from orange to red, its highest level, early Monday local time, The Associated Press reported. Some 40,000 people were evacuated to temporary shelters over the weekend, but an additional 60,000 would still have to move, officials said. They targeted 224 locations for evacuation and told everyone within six miles of Mount Agung to leave.

Some fear a major eruption could be imminent. But the head of Bali’s geological agency told AP: “We don’t expect a big eruption, but we have to stay alert and anticipate.”

Indonesia’s volcano monitoring center said Sunday that magma had already reached the volcano’s surface, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. The last eruption of Mount Agung occurred in 1963, and some 1,000 people were killed after little warning an eruption was about to occur.

Flights were suspended at Bali’s airport at Ngurah Rai, stranding thousands as the volcano erupted three times Saturday and continued on Sunday, Bali’s Regional Disaster Management Agency said. Lombok International Airport on Pulau Lombok also closed, CNN reported.-2

On Monday, Trump will unveil the White House's holiday decor

Washington (CNN) It was in July, just a handful of weeks after Melania Trump and her 11-year-old son, Barron, had moved in to the White House full time, that the first lady started to think about something important on her agenda: Christmas.

With the entire White House to fill with some of the country's most important holiday décor, Trump, as she has done with other issues, began to research, ultimately landing on a theme for her first White House holiday season, according to East Wing communications director Stephanie Grisham.

On Monday, the first lady will unveil "Time-Honored Traditions," which she personally designed, with a nod to the past 200 years of White House holidays.

"Like many families across the country, holiday traditions are very important to us," Trump said in a statement to CNN. "I hope when visiting the People's House this year, visitors will get a sense of being home for the holidays."

http://time.com/5037634/meghan-markle-engagement-prince-harry-groundbreaking/?xid=homepage5 Ways Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Engagement Is GroundbreakingNot too long ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Prince Harry becoming engaged to marry Meghan Markle. Given that she is a mixed-race Catholic divorcee from the United States, royal protocol would have forbidden the match.

But these are changed times — and Markle, who was born to an African-American mother and white father, captured the world’s imagination in late 2016 when it was revealed that the successful actress and philanthropist had won Prince Harry’s heart.

Here’s five reasons why their union will truly break new ground:

1. Markle is a woman of color

The announcement represents a more inclusive royal family, Anna Whitelock, a royal expert and director of the London Centre for Public History and Heritage, tells TIME. As Harry is fifth in line to the throne, Queen Elizabeth would have had to give permission to the marriage. “I think the Queen would have done so, happily” Whitelock says. “I don’t think her being mixed race would have been at all significant for the Queen.”

But Britain’s right-wing tabloids made Markle’s race a talking point and were criticized for dog-whistle racism in their coverage of her. This included a 2016 Daily Mail article that described Markle’s mother’s neighbourhood as being “famous for gangs” as it detailed the number of crimes that happened in the vicinity of her home. In a statement issued by Kensington Palace last Nov., the Prince issued a rare salvo against the press as he defended his mixed-race relationship and criticized the “racial undertones”from the tabloids.

2. She was raised as a Catholic

Far more serious from a historical perspective would have been Markle’s faith. Until 2015, Prince Harry would have been forbidden from marrying a Catholic under royal succession rules, as his grandmother is head of the Protestant Church of England. The regulations were eased as part of a broader shift to remove male bias and religious discrimination in the royal order.

3. She is American

The 36-year-old, who grew up in California, also wins the title of the first American to be officially engaged to a British royal, and come the expected Spring 2018 wedding, Markle may become the first American to be given the title of Her Royal Highness (HRH). An American has married a British royal before, but under very different circumstances. When King Edward VIII began a relationship with divorcee Wallis Simpson, the prospect of them marrying sparked a constitutional crisis. Edward abdicated in 1939 after a year on the throne, before marrying Simpson in France as the Duke of Windsor. The pair never had an official engagement.

4. She is divorced

Markle is a divorcee too, having ended her marriage to music producer Trevor Engelson in 2014, but it is not likely to cause a repeat of the scandal almost 80 years ago. Harry’s father, Prince Charles, was divorced from Princess Diana before marrying Camilla Parker-Bowles in 2005. And with this marriage “the stakes are much lower,” Whitelock says. “Harry won’t be king and will become sixth in line to the throne when [Prince William and Kate Middleston] have their third child … It’s less of a constitutional significance. Of course, if this was William it would have much different implications.”

5. She’s a well-known actor

As an actor, Markle will be more equipped to deal with the international spotlight than other royal fiancees, though it’s not clear whether she will be able to continue in her line of work once she joins the royal family.

But in many ways, Markle shows how “attitudes change” in the space of a single generation, Whitelock says. Her fiancee’s late mother, Princess Diana, came from royal lineage and at the time represented a “young virgin bride.” By contrast, Meghan’s entrance into British public life shows a royal family moving in line with the times.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/27/amazon-real-estate-london-uk-property-investment.htmlThe rise of Amazon and other online giants is creating a new sweet spot in UK real estateMiles Gibson, head of U.K. research at commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE, told CNBC last week that industrials and logistics are performing "very strongly… and investors are seeing double-digit returns."

The other side of commercial property, offices, aren't proving as interesting for investors.

"Offices, for example, are affected by the fact the we have full employment, nearly full employment, in the U.K. so employment growth is slowing, which means demand for offices is slowing, so we are expecting rent growth in office sector for example to slow as well," Gibson told CNBC.

Another issue for office spaces is Brexit and the uncertainty as to how trade between the U.K. and European companies will work after 2019.

"Most of the office space is concentrated in London. Because of Brexit and the uncertainty surrounding it, we expect companies to delay big decisions and thus are generally less likely to sign a new 20-year lease," Carswell said.

He added that relatively high rents and low yields in the office space mean that there is not much room to make returns in investments in this part of the sector. However, he noted that there are a few exceptions, including regional offices, which "offer more upside with higher yields and rents which still look affordable."0

But when Kerry Magro was a child, meeting jolly old Saint Nick wasn't that easy. "Growing up with autism, I had challenges in meeting Santa in public places because I dealt with a lot of sensory challenges, so giant malls were never really an option for me," he told HuffPost. The blaring music, the sparkling decorations, the crowds of people could all be too much to handle. To make this holiday tradition more accessible to kids facing similar struggles, the 29-year-old now provides "sensory friendly" visits with Santa. And who better to play the man in red than Magro himself?

KFM Making A Difference Kerry Magro offers sensory friendly visits with Santa, in which he dresses as the man in red.

Magro, a motivational speaker, author and activist, will be Santa again at an autism and sensory friendly event in Jersey City on Dec. 9 and 10. Since starting this tradition three years ago with his nonprofit, KFM Making a Difference, Magro said he has welcomed some 500 children with various challenges, including autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Parents sign their kids up for 30-minute slots so the children won't feel rushed or overwhelmed, Magro explained. The usual loud Christmas music and bright lights are turned down. Only eight kids with sensory challenges are allowed per time slot. They can participate in arts and crafts, and take home a photo with Santa. An occupational therapist, a speech therapist and a physical therapist ― possibly dressed as Santa's elves ― are also on site.

KFM Making A Difference Since starting the event three years ago, Magro and his team have welcomed kids with autism, ADHD and other challenges.

As for "Santa," he lets the kids take their time and pays attention to their different levels of development. "We don't want them to feel rushed. We don't want them to feel overloaded," Magro told HuffPost. "We just want to make it a labor of love." Magro describes his own childhood as "a time when a lot of people just really had no idea what autism was." He was nonverbal until he was 2-and-a-half years old and struggled with sensory challenges. It took his parents 18 months to obtain a formal diagnosis. Thanks to "a lot of therapy," Magro said, he grew up to be someone who now advocates for others with autism and, through his nonprofit, gives scholarships to students with autism to pursue higher education.2

The bill, which was not significantly amended, now heads to the House when it sits next week. The Turnbull Government is attempting to meet a commitment to legislate marriage equality before Christmas.

Smith noted the historic moment and that it had been a respectful debate, thus far.

"In a world where there are more tensions between people, our country has offered a loving embrace to its own," he told parliament.

And he said there is a message for his party.

Attorney-General George Brandis said today was a historic day and praised the Government's running of the postal vote survey which resulted in a 61.6 percent 'yes' vote and lead to the move in Federal Parliament to legalise same-sex marriage.

"I am so proud of Australian democracy today, more proud than I have ever been. Nobody owns this result, but the Australian people themselves," he said.

"We should acknowledge and respect the historic nature of this occasion in respecting it, we should respect those who decide they do not want to support this bill, but, as it is evident, a clear majority of the chamber do.

"We should rejoice in what the Australian people have achieved this year."

Over the past day, a range of senators, from One Nation to the Greens, have unsuccessfully put forward a range of amendments covering religious concerns and conscientious objections.

But several key government senators including Smith, Defence Minister Marise Payne, Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion, Linda Reynolds, Jane Hume and Education Minister Simon Birmingham voted with the Opposition to vote them down, apart from some technical amendments from Brandis.

Resources Minister Matt Canavan, a marriage equality opponent, conceded defeat.

"It is clear. It is clear that a political fix was in before we amended these amendments on the floor," he told parliament.

Birmingham is feeling optimistic about the road ahead.

"I believe quite possibly, by the end of next week, before Christmas, we will see same-sex marriage legalised in Australia," he told reporters in Canberra.

The Attorney-General would like some additional religious protections added to the bill in the House, but is taking a hands off approach.

"I have taken a very firm view that this ought not to be micro-managed by the government," he told reporters in Canberra. "What the Government promised to do was to facilitate a debate and that is what we have done."1

You are not unusual. You are not abnormal. You are just you."

In a Senate debate on the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017, Brandis spoke about how Australian politicians voted in 1972 to no longer consider homosexual acts between consenting males as an offence under the law and now -- 45 years later -- the country has voted to remove the "last significant bastion of legal discrimination against people on the grounds of their sexuality".

"Profoundly important though the acceptance of same-sex marriage may be as a social change, its symbolic significance is even greater still," he said.

"At last, Australia will no longer be insulting gay people by saying: different rules apply to you. So this Bill is important not merely because it will enable gay people to marry, just as everybody else is able to marry. It is more important than that.

"After centuries of prejudice, discrimination, rejection and ridicule, it is both an expiation for past wrongs and a final act of acceptance and embrace."

George Brandis: "With the passage of this bill, we will demolish the last bastion of legal discrimination against people on the grounds of their sexuality. At last, Australia will no longer be insulting gay people by saying 'different rules apply to you'." November 28, 2017

Brandis went on to address young gay Australians who have struggled in their upbringing to come to terms with their sexuality, saying the passing of the proposed bill through the Senate will serve as a sign of acceptance.

"I want to reflect for a moment on the message this will send, in particular, to young gay people -- to the boy or girl who senses a difference from their friends, which they find difficult to understand and impossible to deal with," he said.

"By passing this bill, we are saying to those vulnerable young people -- there is nothing wrong with you. You are not unusual. You are not abnormal. You are just you. There is nothing to be embarrassed about.

"There is nothing to be ashamed of. There is nothing to hide. You are a normal person and, like every other normal person, you have a need to love. How you love is how God made you. Whom you love is for you to decide and others to respect."

The Senate has devoted this entire week to debating the bill, which would allow same-sex couples to marry. Senators won't be allowed to leave Parliament this week until the legislation has passed and can go to the House of Representatives for further debate and final voting.

In his contribution to the debate the Attorney-General went on to compare the significance of the a marriage equality bill to the 1967 referendum for the constitutional inclusion of Indigenous Australians, saying it "will come to be seen as one of those occasional shining moments which stand out in our nation's history".

"People do remember the 1967 referendum, that great act of inclusion of Indigenous Australians. As the years and decades pass, its significance only grows," he said.

"And I predict that, like the 1967 referendum, this decision by the Australian people, enabled by their government and enacted by their Parliament, will come to be seen as one of those occasional shining moments which stand out in our nation's history.

"About which people will still speak with admiration in decades, indeed in centuries to come -- one of those breakthroughs which have, as the wheel of history turns, defined us as a people."

That Brandis speech was one of the finest chamber contributions you are ever likely to hear #auspol #yeswins — Katharine Murphy (@murpharoo) November 28, 2017

Brandis's speech comes two weeks after Australians voted resoundingly in support of same-sex marriage after the nationwide postal survey returned a majority 'yes' result comprising more than 60 percent of the response.

In delivering the result, ABS chief statistician David Kalisch said 12,727,920 Australians had returned the survey and the 'Yes' vote received 7,817,247 responses, making up 61.6 percent of the responses cast. Thirty-eight percent of respondents voted 'No', a total of 4,873,987.

The decision is one that has spurred an emotional response from more than one Federal MP, with Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young struggling to hold back tears while delivering a speech in support of marriage equality on Monday.

"Millions of Australians have fought for this reform to happen. Inquiries after inquiries, protesting on the street, meeting with members of parliament, lobbying in their workplaces and voting yes. It is now time for the Senate to do our job, to get this done. And without the muddying of the waters from those who have always been opposed to equal love," she said.

"But why is this so important? It's because discrimination to some demeans us all. Because equality is a symbol of a fair, caring and progressive society."1

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/28/how-to-make-easy-gingerbread-men_a_23230561/How To Make Easy Gingerbread MenNo biscuit quite says 'Christmas' like gingerbread cookies -- the fragrance of cinnamon and nutmeg filling the house, the sweet, caramely flavour, the cute little shapes. The best part? Gingerbread cookies are a cinch to make.

If you can't get enough of Christmas (even if it's a month away) or are thinking about making homemade gifts this Christmas, try this recipe for gingerbread men by Teresa Cutter, aka The Healthy Chef. And if you want to spice them up even more, there's a second recipe for chocolate gingerbread cookies.

Plus, as these recipes use wholesome ingredients like spelt flour, buckwheat flour and unrefined sugar, these treats are somewhat healthier than your regular gingerbread cookies.

Gingerbread men

These are the perfect addition to your Christmas table or bundled together as a delicious gift. What I love about these cookies is that they taste like shortbread with a delicate hint of vanilla and spice.

Makes 30 cookies, depending on the size of your cutter.

INGREDIENTS

250g (1 cup) butter, softened

80g (½ cup) rapadura or coconut sugar

1 tablespoon raw honey

Pinch sea salt

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 organic egg

360g (3 cups) wholemeal spelt flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon ginger

100g good quality white chocolate for decoration (optional)

METHOD

Cream the butter, rapadura, honey, sea salt and vanilla with a whisk or the paddle attachment of your mixer. Scrape the sides of your bowl and add the egg. Mix ingredients until combined. Combine the spelt flour, baking powder, cinnamon and ginger in a separate bowl. Add dry ingredients with the wet ingredients and mix until combined. Scrape the dough onto a piece of baking paper and flatten slightly. Wrap up the dough with another piece of baking paper and place into the fridge to rest for at least two hours. Preheat oven to 160°C (320°F) fan-forced. Remove dough from the fridge and roll between two sheets of baking paper until the dough is ½ cm thick. Cut the cookies into shapes (you can use gingerbread cookie cutters, squares, circles or any other shape you would love your cookie to be). Place cookies onto a lined baking tray. Bake for 20–30 minutes or until cookies are just golden. Remove cookies from the oven and cool completely. Decorate the cookies with white chocolate, if you desire, or serve on their own.

Notes: to decorate your cookies, melt white chocolate in a small bowl over a small pot of simmering water. When the chocolate is completely melted, remove from the heat and pour into a small piping bag made from baking paper. Decorate your cookies and enjoy.

Chocolate gingerbread men

An indulgent twist on a classic favourite, these gingerbread men help spread the Christmas cheer. The antioxidants from the cacao helps to naturally boost the feel-good chemicals in the body.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/11/16/what-causes-brain-aneurysms_n_8552100.html?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageWhat Causes Brain Aneurysms? They Aren't Always As Sudden As They SeemBrain aneurysm. 3D computed tomography (CT) angiogram coupled with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain of a 38-year-old, showing a large aneurysm (bright, lower centre) of the right internal carotid artery. An aneurysm is the ballooning of an artery due to weakening of the artery wall.

Caleb Rixon was in the middle of a pump class when he felt by a sharp pain in his skull. He was training for the Australian tour of Chicago, the musical he’d just been cast in. The pain was so strong, that Rixon assumed his eyeball had been pushed from its socket. He stopped class, moved to a mirror and when he was able to confirm his eyeball was still in place, he decided to grab a drink.

“It felt like my eye had shattered or fallen out of my skull,” Rixon told The Huffington Post Australia.

“It was like I’d been struck by lightning. It’s like a thunderbolt went into me and through my eye and I was left with a body that was still trying to deal with being fried.”

Rixon, who was just 24 years old at the time, would later learn this “thunderbolt” was in fact a Grade 5 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage due to a Dural Arteriovenous Malformation. In other words, he had bleeding in his brain caused by two ruptured cerebral aneurysms.

According to the Australian Brain Foundation, aneurysms are present in approximately two percent of adults, and more than 10 percent of those people will experience more than one rupture.

For 25 minutes after the initial burst of pain, Rixon remained conscious. He remembers losing the ability to swallow and speak. He also remembers feeling his body fly out of control.

“It was like my body was separating itself from my mind and my limbs were just sort of flying and people were holding me,” he said.

Rixon was taken to hospital. His parents were called and told to come immediately because doctors didn’t think he would make it through the night.

“I was on life support and unconscious. Without surgery I was definitely going to die, but with the surgery I only had a one in three chance of survival,” he said.

When he woke from surgery, Rixon was unable to stand, walk, swallow, speak or see on his own.

Linda Nichols, Coordinator of Neuroscience Nursing at University of Tasmania, says the chances of a rupture in someone as young as Rixon are quite rare. “Eighty percent of cases usually occur between the ages of 40 and 65,” Nichols said. For this reason, and despite all of his symptoms, Rixon assumed he was fine up until the moment he was rushed to emergency. He just felt “tired and dehydrated,” as he lay prone on the floor unable to move.

“It’s difficult because 25 percent actually walk back out of the hospital because their condition improves. In 40 percent of cases paramedics report the patient has regained consciousness on the way to the hospital,” Nichols said.

“People will often say they had a sudden onset headache, but what’s sudden?”

“If you have an instantaneous, incapacitating headache and it reached its maximum intensity in less than a minute, you should seek professional help immediately.”

Many patients -- 10 - 15 percent -- die from initial bleeding and 40 percent die from later complications.

“The risk of a second bleed increases in the first 24 hours,” Nichols said. “Anything can trigger a re-rupture.”

For Jodie Rushton, 49, two “pimple-sized” aneurysm ruptures left her fighting for her life in intensive care a fortnight ago. “It was in the afternoon and she just got home from work,” her daughter Tiffany Rushton told HuffPost Australia. “She couldn’t stand, she was trying to use the bench and she couldn’t move her legs. The weird thing was she was talking saying she felt sick and she was vomiting.

“She had a seizure and my brother ran out the front to get help. Luckily, the lady who lives across the street, Megan, who we’d never spoken to before works in a hospital so she was able to help and knew what to do.”

Once the ambulance arrived, Rushton had another seizure and the paramedics put her into an induced coma. Up until that point she was refusing to go to hospital, insisting it was just a headache.

“Mum was in ICU for 12 days in total and is now in a brain ward. They woke her up just over a week ago and we were petrified she wouldn’t be able to talk or would have memory loss. The left side of her body wasn’t moving at one stage but now it is and every day she’s getting stronger,” Rushton said.

“She was able to speak, too. It was hard to understand at first, like she was speaking another language, but every day she’s been better and she can eat and speak. We still have to feed her but she can swallow by herself. The speech pathologist and physios have to help her until she gets stronger.”

Rushton and Rixon have one more thing in common -- they were both otherwise healthy. But this isn’t always the case.

“Smoking and excessive drinking both increase the risk as does family history in a first-degree relative,” Nichols said.

The oral contraceptive, hormonal changes and hypertension can also have an impact.

“Females are at higher risk. And there’s a two-to-one prevalence in females to males,” Nichols said.

According to Nichols, the younger the patient, the higher their chance of survival -- granted they make it through the initial bleed.

While Rixon and Rushton can be considered two of the “lucky” ones they don’t always see it that way.

Rixon says being told by medical professionals that he wouldn’t be able to sing again was the hardest part for him.

“I initially had a paralysed vocal cord and I was a professional singer. I was miming words with an eyepatch thinking ‘maybe I’ll be able to join [the Chicago tour] in a few months’, I just had no idea and when that realisation happened it was sad,” he said.

“My voice was the way that I expressed myself and that had been cut off. But I proved them wrong.”

Rixon spent a total of five weeks in ICU and went through over a year of speech pathology and physiotherapy. He spent around four months in hospital and two and a half years in outpatient rehab.

Rushton doesn’t yet know what her recovery journey will look like, but her family and friends are proud of how far she’s come in such a short amount of time.

“She’s so strong so we know she’ll get through this,” Rushton said.

“We haven’t had the easiest 12 months. I know no-one deserves for this to happen, but she really doesn’t. She was just starting to get her life back on track, we moved to a new place, she just started dating someone new -- who happens to be her first ever boyfriend from when she was 17 -- so it’s been hard.”

Rushton’s family and friends have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for rent and bills while she’s unable to work. To date, it’s had over $14,000 worth of donations.

“Mum works at Forest Lodge Cemetery in Leppington and helps people deal with the grief of losing loved ones. So now that the situation is flipped everyone is rallying around her because she’s always there for them.”

“At first, when we set up the fund, mum said she didn’t feel comfortable but when we explained that it would help look after Jaye and I she was a bit more OK with it,” Rushton said.

“She’s been overwhelmed with the support, especially since income protection and insurance takes a while. Her work has been amazing and they’re still paying her and she has a lot of leave accrued so that helps.”

Now 30, Rixon has used his experience to help other young trauma sufferers connect. He launched the Gen Y United Survivor Network (Genyus Network) which is a digital platform for young trauma survivors and supporters that aims to optimise their quality of life and connect their experiences.

“When it happened I felt a bit robbed of my identity. I felt like a victim but once I found hope I found a lot of different ways of engaging with people,” he said.

“When it comes to this stuff, young people aren’t the norm and it’s a bit scary to talk about it but people like me have a lot to say.”

Both Rushton and Rixon hope their experiences can help raise awareness around brain aneurysms so that others can recognise the symptoms.

“In Australia we don’t have headaches as a symptom on any of our stroke awareness campaigns,” Nichols said.

“People don’t often alert professionals over a headache. They sit on them and assume it’s nothing. But if you’re getting headaches more frequently than normal you should see your GP.”

“My mum always had headaches and it’s scary to think it could have been that the whole time,” Rushton said. “I really hope this helps at least one person see a doctor sooner.”

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/05/14/food-labels-are-super-sneaky-heres-what-they-really-mean_a_22082478/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageFood Labels Are Super Sneaky. Here's What They Really MeanWalk down the supermarket aisle and take a look at the front of all the food packages. No doubt you'll see a plethora of buzzwords and enticing 'nature' imagery plastered on the front -- 'superfood', 'gives you energy', 'made naturally', 'real ingredients', 'lite'...

Bad news -- most of these food labels are completely misleading and devoid of nutritional meaning. Yep, those 'no added sugar' energy bars are probably still packed full of sugar. Sneaky.

And it certainly makes us think: this nutrition confusion doesn't help Australia's obesity problem.

"We know that most Australian adults are overweight or obese, and that puts them at risk of cancer and other chronic diseases," LiveLighter dietitian Alison McAleese told HuffPost Australia.

"A lot of these labels don't have any specific guidelines from our food governing body, FSANZ, on how they can be used. Often they're quite trendy words, so it would be difficult to put many measures in place to limit their use."

Food for thought: fruit and veggies don't even have labels to mislead.

Other food labels and claims, such as 'gluten free', are governed by our food code, but manufactures are using these labels as a 'health' word -- for which they're not intended.

"That creates problems because consumers might read them as something that sounds healthier, when that's not actually the case. It's all marketing spiel," McAleese said.

So, what's the best way to not get tricked by food labels and claims? First and foremost, ignore the front of the food package and take a close look at the back.

"There's a couple of things to remember," McAleese said. "One tip I always give people is to shop around the outside of the supermarket, where you get a lot more food that doesn't have labels. They tend to be the healthier foods we should be having every day. It's here that you get fruit and vegetables, nuts, milk and things which you don't have to decipher.

"When you are in the aisles where all the food labels are, just use the back of the packet. Really, the front is fairly freely available for the manufacturer to use all their marketing, so there are all these words that aren't helpful to shoppers.

Here's what 13 misleading food labels really mean.

1. 'Toasted', 'crunch', 'clusters' -- contains added fat or oil

"These are three words that basically mean the same thing, but the label is used on various foods," McAleese told HuffPost Australia.

"It's really another way of saying there is added fat or oil in the product. It sounds better to say 'toasted', 'crunch' or 'clusters'."

2. 'Gives you energy', 'high in energy' -- high in kilojoules

"With this one, it basically means the food is high in kilojoules, and usually that's because it's got a lot of sugar in it," McAleese said.

"The problem here is that in the English language, we use the word 'energy' to mean 'full of beans' or 'life', but we also use that word to describe kilojoules or calories in food. So there's a bit of confusion about how that word is used on food labels."

3. 'Made naturally', 'natural' -- completely open to interpretation

"These ones are not really intended to be a health claim, but a product can sound like it's healthy, particularly when it's a company that uses green imagery and of things growing," McAleese said.

"Really, what it means is that there's no synthetics or lab-made ingredients in it -- but that doesn't mean it's a healthy food."

Also, be particularly wary of companies who use keywords like 'nature' in their brand name. The nutrition information panel will speak much louder than words.

"There's even chips that say 'natural chips'. It's right because they're made out of potatoes, but they're not a healthy food."

4. 'Superfoods' -- trendy ingredients

If you see 'superfoods' where you otherwise might not (say, in a chocolate bar), tread with caution. Although it may contain 'superfoods', it doesn't negate the other potentially unhealthy ingredients.

"These are just trendy ingredients and they're often more expensive than other foods," McAleese said. "Fruit and vegetables will always be the real superfoods, and it doesn't matter which fruit and vegetables. It doesn't need to be written on the packet."

5. 'Real ingredients' -- means absolutely nothing

"This one is interesting, it seems to be a recent buzzword. It doesn't really mean anything," McAleese said.

"It's probably some sort of reflection of the marketing wanting to say the product is a premium or higher quality. But it's not a reflection of the healthiness."

6. 'Creamy' -- full of fat

"You'll see this on pasta and soup products, and we did some research on yoghurts recently and noticed that many yoghurt have this 'creamy' label, as well," McAleese said.

"It basically means that they've added some sort of fat, usually cream or a creamy ingredient."

7. 'Fresh' -- not frozen or canned

Although we typically associate 'fresh' with 'healthy', 'vegetables' and 'wholesome', this may not be the case when the 'fresh' label is plastered onto food products.

"Again, it sounds like it could be healthy but it's not a health claim. It is often used to describe that the food hasn't been frozen or canned, but not always," McAleese said. "It doesn't necessarily reflect that it's full of vegetables or healthy ingredients."

When shopping for pasta sauce, opt for tomato-based tomato sauces instead.

8. 'No artificial colours' -- not synthetic, may still be added colours derived from other foods or ingredients

"If you walk down the confectionery aisle, every second product says 'no artificial colours', but there's lots of places you can get colours from that aren't synthetic," McAleese said.

"It doesn't mean the food isn't full of colour, sugar and fat. Really, it doesn't mean anything in terms of health."

9. 'Lite', 'light' -- can refer to a lighter colour, taste or may be lighter in kilojoules or fat

"If it's in reference to fat, there are some regulations around it. Light milk, for example, needs to be 25 percent less fat than the full fat version," McAleese said. "But there are other areas where 'light' can refer to a lighter taste or colour.

"If you're choosing a product that says 'light' you just need to be careful about how it's being used and make sure you check the nutrition panel, as they don't specify on the front what the 'light' is referring to.

"A classic example is olive oil. Light olive oil is still 100 percent oil, it's just got less of a strong taste. It doesn't reflect the healthiness of it at all."

Sneaky olive oil.

10. 'No added sugar' -- no cane sugar, honey or syrup, but may still be high in sugar (e.g. fruit juice)

The next time you see 'no added sugar' in sweet packaged food, remember this.

"No added sugar is regulated by FSANZ -- it means there's no added sugar, honey or syrups. But there's still food which say 'no added sugar' and they're really high in sugar," McAleese said.

"That's because the product could be chock-full of dried fruit or fruit sugar. Fruit juices may have no added sugar but are still very high in total amount of sugar. Also, those new date and nut bars are often high in sugar but say 'no added sugar'.

11. 'Now with protein', 'high in protein' -- may be added to a previous version of a food, doesn't mean it's healthier

With protein a major buzzword these days, it's easy to think that chips or chocolate added with protein are healthier.

"If it says 'high protein' it needs to have 25 percent higher than the original version, but sometimes it's just got a claim about 'added protein' -- I saw a chocolate bar recently with 'added protein'," McAleese said.

"We already eat too much protein. There's no benefit of having it added and it doesn't automatically make the product healthy."

Even no-added-sugar juice is high in sugar.

12. Organic -- no pesticides used in the production, doesn't relate to the nutrition properties

"Organic refers to how the food was grown and it doesn't reflect the healthiness of the product at all," McAleese said.

"You can get organic chips, which might important for people who want to eat food grown without pesticides, but it doesn't make them more nutritious foods."

13. Gluten free -- safe for coeliacs, doesn't mean it's healthy

"This label is tightly regulated by FSANZ, but unless you have a medical reason to avoid gluten (for example, coeliac disease) it doesn't make the product a healthy option."

These ricotta pancakes are light, fluffy, gluten free and easy to make. Serve with caramelised figs (or banana), extra ricotta and raw honey.

Ricotta pancakes with caramelised honey figs

Recipe by Helen Tzouganatos, celiac food blogger of Hungry and Fussy.

"I love the fluffy lightness of these pancakes. They remind me of a light and airy Italian ricotta cheesecake but even better because they can be whipped up in five minutes," Tzouganatos said.

"In this recipe, I have prepared them with caramelised figs, but they are just as delicious served with a sprinkling of sugar and lemon juice as per my lemon ricotta variation. You can even spoon small drops of the batter into the frying pan and make delicious pikelets."

Preparation time: 5 minutes. Cooking time: 15 minutes.

Serves six.

INGREDIENTS

Pancakes:

3 eggs, separated

1 cup or 130g plain gluten free flour, sifted

¼ cup 55g caster sugar

2 teaspoons gluten free baking powder

Pinch of salt

¾ cup buttermilk

300g ricotta, plus extra to serve

Caramelised honey figs:

6 fresh figs, halved

1 tablespoon raw honey

1 tablespoon butter

METHOD

Whisk egg whites in a small bowl until stiff peaks form. Place all other ingredients into a bowl and whisk to combine. Add stiff egg whites to batter. Fold to combine. Melt a little butter in a frying pan over low to medium heat. Spoon batter into pan and cook pancakes for 2-3 minutes until bubbles pop on the surface. Flip over and cook for a further minute until golden. Repeat until all the batter is cooked. For caramelised figs, melt butter and honey in a frying pan over medium heat. Add figs and cook for one minute on each side until caramelised. To serve, smear pancakes with ricotta and place figs on top. Drizzle with honey.

Tips: the figs will caramelise quickly so keep your eye on them to avoid burning.

Variation: For lemon ricotta pancakes, add two teaspoons of lemon zest to batter. To serve, sprinkle pancakes with sugar and lemon juice.

This may be exciting for the Victoria's Secret models of the world, but for the rest of us, the prospect of stripping down to next to nothing in a public place can be somewhat daunting.

Not to mention the fact there's more to the perfect swimsuit than just looking good. Those bad boys need to support you (quite literally) in the surf, on the sand and -- importantly -- when you're doing your best slow-motion 'Baywatch' run.

But finding the perfect pair of swimmers can be quite an arduous task, especially when dealing with post-winter padding.

So how do you find the right swimsuit for you? HuffPost Australia spoke to Tash Oakley and Devin Brugman of Monday swimwear to find out.

HP: Swimwear shopping can be daunting at the best of times. What are the most flattering styles out this season?

Devin and Tash: "We've worn every style of swimwear, but it's still hard to say which is universally flattering because every body type is so unique. If we had to name one it would be a classic tie side triangle bikini, mainly because it is fully adjustable so you can alter it to fit your own body type. Flattery in swimwear really comes down to adjustability."

A common frustration for women with bigger busts is finding swimwear or a bikini top that supports them without looking like a 'nanna bra'. What styles/cuts are best for them? What styles/cuts should they avoid?

"This is something we struggled to answer ourselves for the longest time and one of the main reasons we created our own swimwear line. We recommend a wider strapped halter neck top that won't dig, an underwire top for a comfortable and flattering fit, or a fully adjustable classic triangle top."

Make sure you pick something that's going to support you in the water.

For those concerned about their mid-section, what are your best tips for a flattering swimsuit?

"A structured one piece featuring a deep V neckline, double lining to help you feel secure, a supportive waist panel and adjustable straps are key. A V-neck and slightly higher cut leg help to add length to the torso and the legs, sweetening all of your mid-section woes. High-waisted bottoms with medium coverage and shaping side panels to sculpt your silhouette and cinch in the waist work really well.

"For new mums, we recommend a fully adjustable triangle style like our Tulum top and bottoms, designed to accommodate fluctuation in cup sizes."

Are there any patterns you would recommend or avoid? (Also, do stripes really make you look bigger?)

"There are all sorts of fashion no-no's when it comes to prints and patterns, but I think swimwear is an exception. If you're into prints, just focus on finding one that really resonates with you -- choosing a new suit is meant to evoke feelings of confidence and fun, and most prints inspire this kind of attitude. In regards to a stripe print, it really depends on the style of stripe, but this definitely applies more to clothing than swimwear."

If you want to accentuate your booty but you don't want to rock a brazilian-style suit, what shapes or cuts would you recommend?

"A higher cut in the leg is a great, subtle way to accentuate your booty. You don't have to be showing more to flaunt what you've got. Go for styles that offer a medium coverage, and are perfect for wearing a little higher on the hips to create length and add a little lift to the booty."

Do you have any advice around sizing? As in is it worthwhile 'mixing and matching' your bikini tops and bottoms?

"Absolutely! We strongly recommend considering your options when it comes to shopping for swimwear. More and more brands are finally catching on to the fact that not everyone is a perfect size 6 or 12 or 14... Devin was very passionate about creating a line of swimwear that didn't discriminate against separate sizing, so every single suit in the Monday Swimwear range is sold separately. This also let's you get creative with styles, not just sizing, so you can create a set that suits you perfectly!"

What swimwear styles would you recommend for the following body types?

Hourglass

"You want to highlight your curves, while still providing enough support and coverage. A bra style top with underwire and supportive straps is always great option, paired with high waisted bottoms is the perfect combo for an hourglass figure."

Apple

"Whether you're looking to completely cover, or slim your mid-section, one pieces or high waisted styles are your best friend."

Straight up and down

"If your goal is to accentuate your curves, go for styles that give that cinch in the waist, accencuate your derriér, and add a little more shape to the bust. One pieces with a waist band are great for this, as are wrap tops that can be tied around the mid section."

Pear

"To balance out your curves, try to accentuate your top half by choosing styles that broaden your shoulders and highlight your décolletage. Bra style tops with underwire and sculpted cups that provide a little lift are the perfect option to get this effect, and pairing with bikini bottoms that feature delicate side straps will give the illusion of narrower hips. If tie sides aren't your thing, go for straps that can be hitched a little higher to elongate the leg."

Is there any other advice or tips you want to share?

"In terms of sizing, you should NEVER try to "stick to your size" in swimwear. I personally wear every size from an XS to an XL in swimwear due to the fact that sizing is by no means standardized. Ignore the tag, whatever feels good is good.

"In regard to season trends -- stylish and flattering underwire tops. There is nothing sexier when done right!"0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/28/can-what-you-eat-help-grow-longer-and-stronger-hair-and-nails_a_23290910/Can What You Eat Help Grow Longer And Stronger Hair And Nails?​​​​​​​

It's rare to find a person that does not wish their hair would grow faster or that their nails were stronger.

Sure, there's all kinds of hair treatments and nail polishes that promise to do just that, but can you promote longer and stronger nails and hair through the foods to you? You bet.

"There is no doubt about it -- what you eat, and also what you don't eat, can really affect your appearance," Dr. Josh Axe, author of Eat Dirt, and co-founder of Ancient Nutrition told HuffPost Australia.

"For example, someone with an iron deficiency is at a greater risk for both hair loss and brittle nails so eating iron-rich foods can really help hair and nail health. Overall, eating a healthy diet filled with nutrient-dense whole foods can go a long way when it comes to boosting the growth and strength of both your hair and nails."

So, what kinds of foods should you look out for?

"Foods that are rich in the following nutrients are excellent at supporting healthy hair and nails," Axe said.

Omega-3 fatty acids: Foods like wild-caught fish, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and walnuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which are anti-inflammatory, hormone-balancing and decrease external dryness.

Iron: Great dietary sources of iron include foods like grass-fed beef, lentils, white beans, and dark leafy greens. An iron deficiency can be underlying cause of thinning hair and dry, brittle nails so getting enough of this nutrient regularly is key.

Biotin (B7): A B vitamin found in delicious foods like eggs, salmon, goat cheese, and almonds, biotin plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of our hair, nails and skin.

Zinc: Zinc is another vitamin essential to healthy skin and nails since it aids tissue growth and tissue repair. Similarly to iron, a zinc deficiency is linked to poor hair and nail growth. High-zinc foods include lamb, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, and cashews.

In addition to diet, having less stress in your life can also promote a healthier looking appearance -- hair and nails included.

"Practising forms of relaxation, such as yoga, journalling, prayer, etc, on a regular basis and balancing hormones can really help to promote the healthy growth of nails and hair since thyroid issues and hormone imbalance as well as chronic stress can contribute to unhealthy hair and nails," Axe said.

As for things that could have a negative effect on growing your hair and nails long and lush?

"Food allergens, processed foods, trans fat and refined sugar should be avoided. Caffeine and alcohol should be chosen wisely and always in moderation."0

The confusion was warranted as Act has been travelling nonstop for basically the last four years. "I just got rid of my car in Los Angeles," she told HuffPost Australia, "I was like 'I'm never here, I don't need a car the three days a month I'm here' so I got rid of it."

But make no mistake, the blonde bombshell is anything but dim. Her brain is like a spreadsheet of dates, times and locations where she's appearing, factoids and trivia flow freely. "Dolly Parton wrote 'I Will Always Love You' as a breakup to her musical partner," she casually mentioned.

Act shot to Aussie fame when she auditioned twice for the first season of 'Australian Idol' once, unsuccessfully, as Shane Jenek. The second time she returned in full drag as Courtney and made it onto the show where she was 13th.

"First anything person, gay, queer, gender or drag in any 'Idol' franchise in the world," Act told HuffPost. "It was such a cool platform and it didn't feel like anything, I was just doing what I loved to do.

"It was cool that everybody felt the same way and went along with it and I got such great support from Dicko and the cast and crew and it allowed me to have the career I have today."

A post shared by Courtney Act (@courtneyact) on Aug 3, 2017 at 7:42pm PDT

Like all the trivia stored in her incredible brain, Act casually mentions the 'Idol' finale was the most-watched television event in Australia since Princess Diana's funeral.

A few years after her stint on 'Idol' Act sashayed into the workroom of 'RuPaul's Drag Race', which was just reaching its peak popularity and shift from cult-favourite to mainstream event.

"'Idol' took me from the gay bars of Oxford Street to the more mainstream world. 'Drag Race' is global. It just keeps growing, it's like a snowball."

Joining the sixth season of the show Act was one of the final three queens, and one of only two of the queens in her season to never be placed in the bottom two.

Since Act's season the show has continued to grow in popularity, with alumni of the series going on to various other industries.

"There are just over 100 'Drag Race' drag queens now, it's like we've surrounded pop culture. We've all joined hands and we're stepping inwards and inwards. There are 'Drag Race' girls in all aspects of the arts."

It's true, Just this month the winner of Act's season, Bianca Del Rio, brought her stand-comedy tour down under. Season Seven queens Katya and Trixie have just launched a TV series based on their popular YouTube videos on SBSViceland.

"It's funny, I feel like everybody's catching on to what I've always known," Act said. "For me drag has always been so much fun and such an amazing way to express yourself and your creativity outside the status quo. There are no rules in drag. It's weird that everybody gets it now."

A post shared by Courtney Act (@courtneyact) on Oct 13, 2017 at 4:51pm PDT

When it comes to Act there's no easy way to list everything she's currently doing. Post 'Drag Race' Act has been touring with two other queens, Alaska and Willam, in a trio they call the AAA Girls.

Act also routinely posts to social media, she's just started a cooking show on her YouTube channel, as well as doing vidoes for the likes of Junkee and MTV. She starred in her third reality show on MTV, 'Single AF', co-runs Wigs by Vanity -- specialty wigs made for drag queens by drag queens she founded with fellow Sydney queen Vanity Faire -- and is now gearing up for several solo shows as well as starring in 'Grease: The Arena Experience' next year.

"I've always loved 'Grease', John Travolta and Olivia Newton John in that movie are like the founding fathers of my childhood. I think I've only ever performed in an arena once before during the 'Idol' tour in 2004.

"To be doing a big arena spectacular is going to be really fun, there's 500 performers so it's like 'Grease' on steroids. Also I get to come on for three and a half minutes and sing one song. I'm basically Heather Locklear in 'Melrose Place'."

While the job may sound cushy, Act is also planning her first nationwide tour straight after her stint in 'Grease' with a new show, 'Under the Covers'.

"I've done shows in some states but this is the first time I've done a full tour. It feels like I'm arriving at the place I always wanted to be. I love performing live and doing cabaret, it's one of my favourite things."

Where 'Grease' has a cast of hundreds, 'Under the Covers' is a more intimate affair. "The show examines what goes on under the covers in our bedrooms, in our minds and in the layers society piles onto us," Act said. "Also all the songs are covers."

A post shared by Courtney Act (@courtneyact) on Nov 21, 2017 at 8:50pm PST

For all that going on, Act still has time to do what she does best, using her platform to educate.

"The great thing about drag is it's so visual. I know that drag queens don't represent the queer community at large but they are highly visible representations because we have big hair, big shoes and tiny outfits.

"Not all drag queens are actively political but I think all drag is passively political because we're going against the status quo and what society said that you should do."

During the U.S. Presidential election Act began doing political explainers for Junkee Media, at one point she travelled to a nearby Trump rally in Connecticut in drag. Having lived in Los Angeles for years now Act attempted to make sense of the election for an Australian audience at home.

Then the tables were turned during the marriage equality postal survey, with Act on the other side of the world.

"It was funny because I had been through the gambit of emotions when America was going through it a couple of years ago. I remember before marriage equality passed [in the U.S.] I was very passionate about equality but I also didn't think that it affected me personally because I was like ho-hum about the concept of marriage. It seemed like an antiquated, misogynistic institution based on ownership and oppression leftover from the yesteryears. But I also completely acknowledged that it was being used as a device to tell queer people that they were 'other' and not equal."

When it passed in the United States, Act realised the impact the decision had on her. "I just burst out crying alone in Mexico City airport. I didn't see it coming and didn't anticipate that it would have such a profound effect on me, I just knew that I had compartmentalised this part of myself.

"While I accepted myself and was proud of who I was and had the love and support of my friends and family, I hadn't even thought about a world where I was viewed as equal in the eyes of the law. It was then I realised it wasn't about marriage, it was about equality."

Watching the news happen from the States, Act knew from that how important the vote was for Australia.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/28/9-blind-date-survival-tips_a_23290860/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage9 Blind Date Survival TipsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle might be hurtling towards a fairytale wedding thanks to a blind date in 2016. But for many, the very idea of being set up by a mate is enough to bring them out in hives.

That said, while there are plenty of blind date horror stories floating around, that's not to say they can't end in happiness. (Or at the very least, amicably.)

Here, dating pros reveal their dos and don'ts to help you bag yourself a second, not-so-blind date.

Do trust your friend

The thought of placing your love life in your best mate's hands might be nerve-racking, but dating coach and expert James Preece said it could actually work wonders for your love life.

"Your friend probably knows you better than you even know yourself," he said. "They'll understand the type of person you need to make you happy rather than the ones you think you want. They've watched you in your previous relationships and have seen you at your best as well as your worst."

Do your research

The benefit of having a friend set you up is that you can get some key intelligence about your date before you meet (without having to trawl through Facebook at the risk of accidentally liking something from 2015).

Tania O'Donnell, author of Slow Dating: A Technophobe's Quest for Love Offline, said: "Ask the person setting you up what the other person is like and if there are any stories they can tell you about him or her. This will provide you with an icebreaker conversation."

Do pick an informal place

Choosing a chilled out setting for your blind date can be very beneficial and can take some of the pressure off, as it allows you to leave if things go terribly.

Tania explained: "Pick an informal place such as a pub or coffee shop and only meet for drinks. If you get along well, you can always extend it to dinner, but if it isn't going well, you're only committed to a couple of drinks and can make the excuse that you have a supper booked with a friend in order to leave."

Dating expert Madeleine Mason, from PassionSmiths, added that first dates should always be a short, 60 to 90-minute "chemistry check" to help you get a feel for whether you'd go on a second date or not.

Do make an effort

Tania is a firm believer that people should take care over their outfit, the venue and plans when on a blind date. After all, if everything goes well you don't want the story of how you met to be clouded by the fact you wore tracksuit bottoms.

"Make an effort with your appearance," she said. "It doesn't come across as desperate or trying too hard - it is a common courtesy to look and smell nice on a special occasion.

"To do less makes it seem as though you're not that bothered and, while some pick-up artists might think this is an appropriate impression to give, it doesn't really bode well for any resulting relationship."0

Their photos line the walls of the stations, their stories fill the libraries. Indeed, the names of the stations themselves pay homage to great adventurers of the continent. Australian stations bear names like Davis and Mawson, who helped chart the way to the South Pole, losing men in a heroic and horrific quest that saw him miss his boat home by mere hours and have to wait another year for the ship to return. For his trouble, he got his face on some Australian banknotes and a whole lot of frostbite and Vitamin A poisoning from having to eat his dogs. The United States bases of Amundsen–Scott and McMurdo, and the French facility Dumont d'Urville, are also named for great Antarctic adventurers. Their exploits are mythic. Tales of limbs and fingers and feet blackened by frostbite; sleds and dogs and men disappearing into great yawning crevasses, never to be seen again; stories of pure, raw survival and endurance, of simply refusing to die, of inching their way through blizzards and storms and endless miles of nothingness, pushed along by the simple unvarnished ideals of exploration and pioneering for its own sake.

With Antarctica's human history built off the back of death, injury and sickness, it's little wonder they take safety so seriously. You're kitted out with bags and bags of safety equipment -- boots, jackets, at least six types of gloves, unbelievably long and thick socks, thermal underwear, goggles. Everybody takes it seriously, layering and layering and layering. It's not uncommon, however, to spot a expeditioner getting around outside in just a t-shirt, shorts and the standard issue black moon boots when the weather warms up (which is to say, when it gets somewhere near zero degrees C). The standard uniform is affectionately named the 'banana suit', a big yellow safety suit of bright overalls and a parka about two inches thick. The station's doctor tells us that an injury like a broken leg, or worse, is rare -- about a twice-a-year occurrence. Of more danger is exposure. You would go 'snow blind' from the glare of the perfect whiteness in 15 minutes without goggles or sunglasses. Frostbite can get you even more quickly. In Antarctica, the equipment saves your life. It's the key focus of the mandatory survival training course that every expeditioner must complete before they're even allowed to walk outside the station limits. For several hours we're taken through survival basics -- how to navigate back to station if we get lost, the safest way to walk across frozen sea ice, how to read the GPS units and use the radios we need to take on a long trek, how to work the ice axe and bivouac sack and all the rest of the gear in the massive survival backpack. We're also taught how to "relieve" ourselves when out on a long walk with a pee bottle and a field toilet, basically a glorified bucket; no pissing on trees or digging a pit out here (and a free tip, try not to leave your bottle out in the snow to get frozen solid into a pee slushie).

After the long process of suiting up -- long thermal underwear, thick knee-high socks, polar fleece pants and jacket, overalls, puffer jacket, beanie, gloves, snow goggles -- we're ready. We begin the trek out to Shirley Island, a little speck just offshore. The sea ice is thick enough to form a bridge for us to walk out from the ice shelf and across onto the rock island. We're told there's a penguin colony on the island, but much like at the zoo, didn't expect to see much besides a few stragglers milling about while the others slept. We round a hill, march over the crest and I spot a penguin or two on the ice in the distance near the water. I'm happy and point it out to a fellow survival trainee. She gives me a funny look and points about 60 metres to my left. What I thought was an outcrop of rocks or moss is a massive squad of penguins, waddling about, squawking, sliding around on their bellies, trying to claim the best position on the rock and dirt. There's another bunch about 100 metres to the side, then another, then another. Laid out in front of us, lazing around nearly in the shadow of icebergs in the bay, sit thousands upon thousands of fat Adelie penguins, cheerfully chirping and chattering away; Johnstone says there's around 10,000 on the Shirley colony. A lone fat seal is splayed out on the ice not far away. We sit on a rocky outcrop for lunch, drinking in the best view in the world.

Before long, nightfall sets in and we set about digging those icy graves -- our beds for the night. We sleep out in the snow, mimicking a situation where we might be stranded outside the station overnight with no way back. We melt snow on little camp stoves to make boiling water for our dehydrated meals. You can actually 'burn' snow, we find out, if you melt it too fast on too high a temperature. The beef stroganoff, formerly a rock-hard dehydrated lump in a paper bag, becomes quite tasty once warmed up. Our instructor teaches us how to dig snow 'coffins', deep trenches in the ground to lay our sleeping bag and bivvy bag to get out of the wind. Three-feet deep, it's cold down here surrounded by snow and ice, but it's still. The penguins become a beloved feature of our time here, as they do for most expeditioners. "I think everyone remembers the first penguin they saw," laughs PhD student James Black, who is studying ocean acidification. Adelie penguins waddle up close enough to touch; brave and bold. There's no natural predators for them once they're out of the water. Seals are too slow to get them on land, so the penguins march right up to us, crane their necks up to check us out, stretch their little wings back and puff out their chests. Once assured we pose no threat, they waddle off again. It's mating season and the males are engaging in a unique ritual -- searching for the perfect rock to present to a potential mate. It's a penguin version of an engagement ring.0

Around 18 months ago I travelled back to the UK to surprise my father for his 70th birthday party. It was an absolutely magical moment as I shuffled towards the front door with a cardboard box in front of my face and yelled "SURPRISE!".

My dad was delighted, my brother and sister were delighted, and so was my mum. Even though she and Dad have been divorced for 17 years -- more than half my life -- she was the one who drove me to the party.

We are a loving, supportive family, but we are not a conventional family. My mum came out when I was 14. In a dimly lit room, she quietly told me that the woman we knew as a close friend was someone she had embarked on a relationship with.

My parents lived together (in separate rooms) for a further two years, something that I now see for the huge sacrifice it was: living in the same house to provide stability and consistency for their teenage children.

Love is the basis of our family, not marriage.

Tony Abbott recently wrote that, "if you change marriage, you change society; because marriage is the basis of family; and family is the foundation of community".

Of course, every family is different. But in my family, what matters wasn't and isn't that my parents divorced, or that my mum came out. What mattered, what still matters most, is love, support and respect.

When my mum moved out of the home that my brother, my sister and I grew up in, she moved five minutes around the corner so we could walk between each parent's house and sleep at whichever house we wanted to. No complicated custody agreements, just whatever my siblings and I wanted to do. When my dad made us 'curry' during his experimental cooking phase, we ate it even though pineapple, chicken, curry sauce and peas are not necessarily an appetising combination. We ate it because he tried.

If my mum knew Dad was at work, she would come over -- take the back-door key from its 'secret' hiding spot -- wash and dry his curtains and re-hang them before he got home. Not because my dad was lazy, he simply didn't notice when the curtains were dirty, and Mum wanted the house to be nice for all of us.

Dad never said a bad word about Mum, and Mum never said a bad word about Dad. They had each other's backs. We spent every birthday and Christmas together, sometimes with my parent's new partners. And now they both have long-term partners or companions who we have known for years -- it's almost like having a mum, a dad and then two more mums.

That's not to say it was never sad or hard to accept that they had separated. It doesn't mean that we never argued with our parents, or had teenage tantrums or that Mum and Dad were perfect. We all f****d up in different ways, but the one consistency was love.

My family has helped me understand that marriage is simply allowing two people who are in love to have that love recognised by law. Conflating family and marriage does a disservice to both.

Having an unconventional family has not harmed me or my brother or sister. We have all gone on to be successful and happy in our chosen fields. We did this with our 21st Century, decidedly non-nuclear family. We did it because our parents backed us, and loved us, and told us if we worked hard we could be what we wanted in life.

So we did. And we are. My family is not about the specific sum of its parts, the number of men or women who play the role of parents, it's about how capable each member of the family is to love and support one another, unconditionally.

It's about parents answering phone calls at 1am when their kids are in a foreign country and stressed out about work. It's about writing 12 cards to be opened on each of the 12 days of Christmas when a daughter lives overseas or taking a six-hour round trip to drive and pick up a child from the airport.

Once, four or five years ago, the five of us had dinner at Dad's house. Mum mentioned that someone had asked her when she would be getting some grandchildren, and she had warned them never to say that in front of my brother or sister or me. We thanked her and Dad for never pressuring us to be -- or do -- anything other than what made us happy. Dad looked taken aback. "Of course! Our job is just to support you and help you be happy," he said. I won't ever forget that.

The truth is that my parents were, and are, better as friends. They should be allowed to love and marry who they want. That should be the case for everyone, including here in Australia. Because loving who they wanted enabled them to be better parents, better and happier people and made our family vastly richer in love and understanding.

It has made my siblings and I better people, more capable of being better members of our communities. Love is the basis of our family, not marriage.0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/02/14/kristin-davis-unhcr_n_9233756.html?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageKristin Davis Talks About The Refugee Crisis And Why Women Need A Voice“They said ‘come, come, this way. You have to come this way'. So I went. And on the ground there was a woman. I asked why she was sitting on the ground in the dust, and I was told that she had polio and was unable to walk. She had been living in South Somalia where they did not allow vaccinations. She started telling her story while crying quietly. Her friends and family had set out [for the refugee camp] together. She had five children when she left, and she had lost two of them on the way. The clothes from her body had been stolen. She had been raped. Her husband had been killed. When she [reached the outskirts of the camp] she had her three remaining children with her. They were hoping I was a doctor because there was something wrong with one of her children. She kept trying to show me a wound on her child. I had no medical equipment. It was one of those times that I was desperately wishing 'why am I not a doctor?'”

So is the reality in Dadaab, Kenya -- the largest established refugee camp in the world, and certainly countless other camps and refugee communities. Kristin Davis can tell this story, and many others like it, because she's witnessed them.

Most famous for her role as Charlotte in Sex And The City, the American actress has been a long time humanitarian, philanthropist and animal activist. She’s the Global ambassador for Oxfam, works with The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust -- a program in Kenya focused on raising orphaned elephants and rhinos before reintroducing them into the wild -- and last week was in Australia with Australia for UNHCR, a not-for-profit which raises funds to provide life changing support for displaced and stateless people.

Davis had what can only be described as an ‘interesting’ visit to Australia last week. I received an invitation to interview her through Australia for UNHCR. The invitation detailed some shocking statistics around refugees, including the fact that 40 percent of rapes happen when women and children venture out in search for food and that 80 percent of displaced people and refugees are women and children.

The statistics alone are shocking. The issue has nothing to do with Davis's acting career; her humanitarian work speaks volumes without any mention of 'Sex And The City'. Speaking with The Huffington Post Australia, Davis detailed the work of the charity and her experiences on the many visits she has made to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Somalia.

“In Dadaab the influx of refugees was greater than the capacity of the camp. There is a very involved registration process [for arriving refugees]. You have to get a number, you have to be officially registered to be in the camp and receive the services -- I don't think people realise that -- and the registration people had been overwhelmed by the incoming refugees. There were these women who had come from Somalia and they had collected rags -- literally pieces of fabric that were torn -- and they had collected them to put in the trees to try and make a makeshift tent to create an area where little children could sleep together. This one particular woman we spoke to at length had collected seven children along the way who had lost their parents. Their parents had been killed or whatnot, we don't know, so she would take the children with her. To see what she had been able to create with literally nothing was incredible. I am so impressed with their resourcefulness and resilience.”

Davis has worked with Oxfam and UNHCR since 2001. Impressively, Australia for UNHCR raises the most funds from the private sector and individuals to support these areas of any country in the word -- a fact that impressed Davis given Australia’s relatively small population and lengthy distance from these crisis areas.

During a charity lunch on Friday, Australia for UNHCR launched the ‘I will’ campaign, which asks people to start conversations around this important issue, or take further action. Davis put it perfectly at the lunch when she stated that “we can’t make things better if we can’t talk about them. Not talking about things that are real to women, hurts women".

The campaign encourages people to visit refugeewomen.org.au where consumers can read refugee women’s stories, or by sharing a pledge on social media through the hashtag #iwill. By raising awareness and funds for these causes, UNHCR are able to continue their work in providing supplies and services -- such as the 'Refugees United' website -- a Facebook-like forum where displaced people can seek to locate lost loved ones.

Davis’s passion is more than apparent; she personally donated a $10,000 diamond necklace for the auction. And she's humble when it comes to any praise. She says that she has never really viewed herself as a humanitarian, but more as a witness. Growing up in the South of the United States, Davis had an ordinary childhood and dreamed of traveling, though didn't travel abroad until her late teens. It was on a Safari in Africa that she first encountered a glimpse of the reality in these countries when she witnessed a man with AIDS at a local livestock market. It was then that she began to question the truth behind the tourism veil, and from that her journey began. She also attributes her dedication to being surrounded by strong women in her life.

"I have a grandmother who is turning 107. Her name is Flossie and she comes from Appalachia, in the mountains of North Carolina -- hillbilly country, basically -- and she grew up on a creek where there was just a dirt path. We would go there when I was little and I remember my great grandmother in this dilapidated house in her rocking chair, and my dad would take his recorder and record her stories. Now my grandmother, who is 107, had moved down to South Carolina with my parents -- though she lives in her own apartment I should mention. She lived with my parents for a while but she thought it was boring -- there was no bingo, no possibility of winning chocolate bars -- so she was out of here. So I have had a lot of really strong women to watch, strong in their own way. My own mum is quiet and reserved, but when I was young where I grew up there was still a confederate flag on the top of our capital building. It was still there until very very recently. Every single year my mum would picket to get that flag taken off the top. It took 30 years, but she tried. She also worked at planned parenthood. Back in the day none of my friends mothers did that! She would tell me she was doing it because those women needed to have reproductive rights, and I was like 'okay, cool mum!' She had her own quiet maverick qualities."

Speaking about her own adopted daughter, something she reportedly rarely does, Davis mused over the fact that she is trying to educate her about the ways of the world while still protecting her from all of the harsh realities at such a young age.

“It's tough. Gemma, my own child, would give over her toys. When she was two in the playground she would give over her toys and I would think “that was so sweet, she knows how to share”, but then a wise teacher taught me to advocate that she doesn't have to give up her toys if she's not done playing with them. She was right. Because we tend to think about being polite, but of course on the other hand I want to teach her to speak up for herself and [teach her that] she doesn't just have to hand over everything just because somebody else wants it. It's about having a voice. Speaking up. Talking about what's important, Protecting other women. Teaching younger women they have a voice. Please speak up. We need you to speak up. It's important. We want your voice. We need your voice. My daughter is surrounded by elephants, and videos of giraffes, and mummy with the elephants and the giraffes. I don’t show her everything because it can be confronting. She is only 4, but I have shown her some photographs because I want to explain to her why I am gone. I want her to know that it's for a very good reason and I wouldn't leave her unless it was something I felt very passionate about. But I don't want to make her feel like she's living in a horrible world. It's about finding the balance.”

I asked Davis what she would like to see happen for these female refugees, beyond being provided with immediate aid, which UNHCR is already working tirely to supply.

“I think the biggest thing is the livelihood training. It has really become the focus, because in the immediate emergencies we do have a very developed structure -- but because the regions are so destabilized, if they don't have a livelihood to create independence they are then subjected, again and again, to being vulnerable to all kinds of horrible violence, where there are no police to turn to, and there just isn't the services there that we take for granted. Having livelihood helps them create a safe space, and a safe space for their children to grow up and go to school.”

And what came of the woman with polio?

“Of course there was a doctor in the camp and we ended up getting her lots help. The Handicap International NGO brought her a wheelchair. The friends she had made on her journey [to the camp] set up her makeshift tent close to the latrine so she was able to get water. She was given extra buckets so she could get lots of water, as her remaining children were too little to help. Everyone banded together. There was was such a tremendous community response -- and in the end we found out that her sister came to get her and she was able to go back home.”

This Is What I Saw."By the time my father caught up to us an hour or so later I was rigged up to Monty Python’s machine that goes PING! in the Intensive Care ward, where I stayed for several days."

When I was young I was a good cricketer. If you think that's immodest, don't worry, I wasn't good enough to make contact with a bouncer from a visiting team's opening bowler, who jagged it into the pitch and then into my heart. Which it stopped. Dead.

Not immediately, though. Apparently I walked 15 paces in the direction of the clubhouse, so everyone thought I was just heading off. Until I collapsed.

I only remember the first of those steps. And the pain. Sharper than anything I'd felt before. Or since. (Except when a girlfriend at university broke it in subsequent years, but that was a different brand of pain.)

When I woke up some time later, or should I say: when they forced me awake some time later, by all reports I had a smile on my face. I had been to a welcoming place most people access via a one-way street. My father was relieved. I was too young to stay.

I was the fish tossed back in the ocean coz he wasn't big enough.

I was 12 years old and he was a spectator at the match. My father was good like that -- always following my sporting pursuits. And now here he was following the ambulance that was stuck in Sydney traffic on the way to Royal North Shore Hospital. No siren. After half an hour my vital signs were good.

Until suddenly they weren't again.

Dad said later that when I had the second heart attack it took everything he had not to mount the median strip and follow the screaming ambulance down the wrong side of the road. By the time he caught up to us an hour or so later I was rigged up to Monty Python's machine that goes PING! in the Intensive Care ward, where I stayed for several days.

When I woke I was glad to see him, as I was to see my Mother and the rest of my family who had raced to my bedside. These were the people I would have left behind, and although I loved them with all my pulverised heart, I can honestly say that I wouldn't have missed them had I remained in that welcoming place.

That's not heartless, it's death, or my experience of death at least. They would have suffered my death. Not me. I wouldn't have been able to miss them. It was the end of my life and everything I'd known hitherto. It was the end of Dad taking me to Saturday sport. The end of Mum letting me sit on her lap and drive the last few metres down the drive and into the garage. The end of laughter and squabbles with my brother and sister. That bouncer I missed was the end of everything.

And yet, it wasn't. In fact, it was merely the end of my cricketing days.

There are so many clichés around death. There was nothing unique about mine, apart from the fact I came back from it. And while I'm glad I did I would have been quite happy to stay. In that welcoming place I wasn't capable of regret, or sorrow, or frustration that I hadn't ticked things off a bucket list. I wasn't capable of conscious thought. All I felt was warm and safe.

But I only got two minutes into death. Perhaps in the third minute the man with a pitchfork appears and starts berating you for all the things you did wrong, which as a 12-year-old wasn't much, apart from stealing James Nicholson's footy cards and harbouring impure thoughts about my science teacher and her plunging neckline.

"Hello. Up or down, Sir?"

All I can say for sure is that the famed light was bright, but I can't work out if it was bright on the way back or on the way there, and because the only people who report it being bright are those who have come back, then I'm afraid my testimony is as unreliable as theirs and you will have to wait your turn to find out.

My brief experience of the afterlife has changed my lived life. I was the fish tossed back in the ocean coz he wasn't big enough. And despite only entering the lobby of death's hotel – which I hope is five-star -- I feel I saw enough to know that death is probably the most relaxed pose you'll ever strike. It is peace. Pure peace. Nothing to be feared apart from the road you take to get there and the wellbeing of the people you loved and left behind.

When your cricket ball comes, they will be the ones who remember everything you forget. So love them with all your heart while it's still beating strong.

Forty-three senators voted in support of the legislation while 12 voted against. Passed without any amendments, the marriage equality bill now heads to the House of Representatives, also known as the lower house, where it’ll be voted on Monday.

With the majority of lawmakers in the lower house in favor of the bill, it’s expected to pass with ease, reported Australia’s ABC News. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had promised to legalize gay marriage by Christmas ― a vow he’ll now likely be able to fulfill.

Earlier this month, Australians overwhelmingly voted yes on marriage equality in a national postal survey. More than 61 percent of the 12.7 million people who voted in the nonbinding poll expressed their support of gay marriage.

here's the moment marriage equality passed the Senate - huge applause, cheering, hugging. What a moment 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 pic.twitter.com/B7OZpgIJzb — Josh Butler (@JoshButler) November 29, 2017

Wednesday’s vote marks the first time a same-sex marriage bill has passed in either Australia’s Senate or House of Representatives — though this hasn’t been for lack of trying. According to The Guardian, Australia has failed more than 20 times to legalize gay marriage.

Speaking to her Senate colleagues before the final vote Wednesday, Senate Leader of the Opposition Penny Wong said Australia’s lawmakers were standing “on the cusp of a remarkable achievement and an historic event.”

“What [marriage equality] says to young LGBTIQ Australians, what it says to the young man struggling with who he is, or the young woman who feels alone and ashamed, what it says to the children of same-sex couples who feel ostracized,” said Wong. “It says to so many Australians, this parliament, this country, accept you for who you are. Your love is not lesser, and nor are you. It says you’re one of us.”

Wong is Australia’s first openly gay woman in Parliament. Photos showing her in tears following the postal survey result went viral earlier this month.

To all Australians thank you for standing up for fairness and equality. To my colleagues and all those who fought for this great outcome, thank you. pic.twitter.com/g8gaQJtzyC — Senator Penny Wong (@SenatorWong) November 15, 2017

Also speaking before the vote, Sen. Dean Smith shared the story of why he’d decided to author the marriage equality bill.

Smith, who is gay, explained how he had opposed marriage equality until the death of Tori Johnson, a gay man who was killed in the 2014 Sydney hostage crisis.

“Tori lost his life in the Lindt terrorist siege. He was brave, he was courageous and he had a partner named Thomas,” Smith said. “I thought of their loss and it changed me. I realized that people with real lives deserve their love to be blessed and affirmed by the institution of marriage if they so choose.”

Smith later said the bill’s passage showed just how far Australia had come in the fight for equality.

“In the course of a generation, we have seen the LGBTI community move from rejection to tolerance, from tolerance to acceptance, and from acceptance to embrace,” he said, according to BuzzFeed.1

The teaser for the first installment of the upcoming “Avengers: Infinity War” movies has finally been released after some footage debuted at San Diego Comic-Con earlier this year. It’s pretty awesome.

In the video, we see a ton of superheroes meet up: Captain America (Chris Evans) is now bearded and in a new, dark, emo-looking suit; Thor is with the Guardians of the Galaxy; Vision (Paul Bettany) might’ve just been killed in front of our eyes; and Thanos (Josh Brolin) shows up to completely stomp everybody.

All of this is interspersed with a slew of action scenes and a giant battle in what we can assume is Wakanda from the jungle setting. But what really caught our attention were the Marvel mysteries the footage casually solves.

Is Captain America still Captain America?

Nah, it doesn’t look like it.

As “Infinity War” directors, the Russo brothers, previously told HuffPost, when Captain America dropped his shield in “Captain America: Civil War,” the gesture did in fact signal that the hero is seemingly letting go of his old identity.

It remains to be seen if he’ll take on the moniker “Nomad,” which he does at one point in the comics.

Loki mystery solved on the low key.

In the latest “Thor” movie, we’re left wondering whether Loki takes the Tesseract from Asgard, only getting a scene of him eyeing it in Odin’s vault.

The new “Avengers” trailer appears to confirm the God of Mischief was up to his gosh-darn tricks. Gosh darn it! One scene shows Loki (Tom Hiddleston) holding the Infinity Stone and handing it to someone (possibly Thanos). This also might answer how Thanos’ ship apparently finds Thor and Loki at the end of “Thor: Ragnarok.”

Peter Parker is confirmed to have Spidey sense.

Like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) with her blonde hairdo and Captain America with his emo lumberjack vibe, Spider-Man has a new look in the trailer, too, sporting an upgraded suit. The hero’s powers are on full display as well, with his arm hairs springing up during a scene on a bus, apparently confirming Spider-Man’s Spidey sense.

Will everyone die?

Probably. Like we said, Vision might’ve died right there in the trailer.

When Thanos talks about “balance,” that could be a reference to a comic story plot line in “Infinity Gauntlet,” when Death, after sensing an imbalance in the universe, tasks Thanos with killing a bunch of people.

Spoiler alert! In that story, basically all the Avengers are killed, at least for a bit.

Plus, the official synopsis sent by Disney says: “The Avengers and their Super Hero allies must be willing to sacrifice all” ... aka they’re gonna die.0

Michael Stone was jailed in 2001 for the killing of Lin Russell, 45, and her six-year-old daughter Megan and is serving three life sentences. Josie, nine, survived but was gravely injured in the frenzied knife attack.

PA Archive/PA Images Michael Stone was convicted of murdering Lin Russell, 45, and her six-year-old daughter Megan.

Bellfield is currently serving a life-sentence for the rape and murder of 13-year-old Milly Dowler as well as the killings of Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. There was no DNA evidence linking Stone to what became known as The Chillenden Murders and his conviction hinged upon the testimonies of three criminals who said he had confessed to them. One later admitted he had lied and another was discredited but the third stood by his testimony. THE MURDERS The attack occurred as Russell and her daughters Megan and Josie walked back from a school swimming gala along a country lane in Chillenden, Kent, on 9 July, 1996. The court heard Stone approached the trio and asked for money, before striking Russell with a hammer at least 15 times. He then turned the tool on Josie, smashing her skull and leaving her for dead. Megan was then hit at least seven times. One of the family dogs, which was with the trio, was also killed. Russell’s husband and the father of the girls, Dr Shaun Russell, was initially told his whole family had been killed in the attack. It was only when a policeman at the scene noticed Josie move that it was realised she had miraculously survived. She was rushed to hospital with “serious life-threatening injuries” including a large puncture mark behind her left ear, several lacerations to her skull and extensive tearing to the covering of her brain.

MICHAEL STONE After a year-long police investigation, heroin addict Michael Stone of Kent, was charged, tried and found guilty of the attack in 1998. Appeal judges quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial in 2001. Stone was convicted for a second time in a trial in which Damien Daley, an inmate in Canterbury prison, claimed he had heard Stone confessing to the killings. In 2004, lawyers argued Stone had not received a fair trial and won the right to a second appeal. In 2005, judges at the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction handed down at his second trial. Stone was sentenced to three life terms and will not be considered for release until 2031. Witnesses told the jury Stone injected heroin several times a day. Other evidence heard was that he had gone to a friend’s house with his T-shirt spattered with blood and that he had burned his clothing after the attack.

THE CONVICTION Stone continues to claim his innocence and several tabloids have named alternative suspects, leading to speculation his conviction could be unsafe. Stone’s lawyer Paul Bacon has requested a review of the case, claiming Bellfield may have been responsible. In 2011 Bacon told the BBC: “Bellfield is 6ft 1in and it was said by Josie that the person was a bit taller than her dad. Her dad was 6ft. Michael Stone is 5ft 7in. “The e-fit, which was composed at the time of the murder is round faced, red faced, ruddy cheeked. If you look at the picture of that e-fit composed in 1996 against the photographs of Levi Bellfield in 1996, there are so many similarities it is untrue. “Compare that e-fit with the long thin face of Michael Stone in 1996 and the differences are startling.” Bacon also pointed out the make and model of the car Josie described as having been at the scene matched that of the beige Ford Sapphire Bellfield was driving at the time. Kent Online cites further sources, one of whom claims a local man who has since died may have committed the murders and attacked Josie. LEVI BELLFIELD Last year Mark McDonald, another member of Stone’s legal team told the Sunday People he and his team had visited Bellfield’s first wife Rebecca Wilkinson and daughter to quiz them about his involvement. He said: “We went to see Levi Bellfield’s wife and daughter to ask them whether or not they had a view on the Russell killings. We knew that he knew the area. We got the impression that he had already considered it and that he was involved in it.

“The 55-year-old showcased a body many women half her age would be proud of in her eye-catching vest, leggings and black leather boots,” it said.

The article, which has since been amended, originally listed the actress’s age as 55, when she is in fact 44.

The piece is essentially a series of photos of Kate coupled with the headline: “Vest-ed interest! Kate Beckinsale showcases toned arms in revealing tank top as she goes shopping.”

The actress was inspired to post the status slating body shaming on Instagram after seeing an article about herself published on the MailOnline.

Kate Beckinsale has hit back at “archaic” articles that create a culture of “shame” among women by making us unnecessarily focus on our bodies.

Writing on Instagram, Kate explained that she usually avoids reading such articles about herself, but someone sent her the MailOnline link.

“While yes, it can be funny to read untrue things about yourself, I’ve been aware for years, (with this newspaper but by no means confined to it), of how the glee in shaming women, often with lies like this, is so much darker and further reaching than enjoying a little schadenfreude that some model looks rough without makeup,” she said.

“The tactic to create cultural shame for things that are truly beyond our control, for example, gaining weight when pregnant, having short legs or big ankles, or lower boobs that a Barbie, ageing, having big ears, long toes, being menopausal, is an archaic but pretty clever trick.”

The mum-of-one said these portrayals often hit woman when they are at their most powerful “creating life, growing into themselves emotionally and intellectually”.

“The knee-jerk rush to bully her body in pregnancy and afterwards, her age, her cellulite, hacking a phone for private photos and mocking her vagina, trickles down from the one shamed woman and leaks into our whole culture, becomes a source of shame to be avoided by all women, all of us participating in this flight from shame about the stuff that makes women women,” she said.

She called on her followers to resist being “distracted or tormented” by our natural bodies and instead use that energy to effect change.

“It’s not going to stop tomorrow. A whole raft of women will be picked apart for a million things tomorrow,” she said.

“I urge us all, as females, to see it for what it is. Fear of YOU. Fear of the magical mystery shit a woman can do with her magical body. Fear of what she can withhold or bestow.

“It’s the same impulse to reduce the power of a pretty girl who wouldn’t date you in school by becoming a big boss and getting your penis out at a meeting it made you feel powerful to set, knowing what you were going to do. It’s fear. Don’t let it in.”

She ended her powerful speech by calling on women to try and “mend” the fear together, “rationally and peacefully”.

“I’m not manbashing. I’m not even newspaper bashing,” she said.

“I just want to get to where this nonsense feels as archaic as smoking on planes- we put up with it, it harmed us, and we don’t miss it.”

More than 31,000 people have liked the post, with hundreds of people commenting to show their support.

“Well said. It is a challenge raising our daughters in this age of everyone’s lives being so public,” one user said.

“I look forward to the day when my youngest daughter finally accepts that she is a very real and unique woman and is not required to conform to anyone’s ideals of what she needs to look like or act like.”

And the sad reality is that not a lot will change as there is not much need for the cybercriminal community to do anything different – it’s already working well now!

The cybercriminal community is all about profit and that means they continue to utilise the same sorts of tactics if they continue to gain the results they are after – mainly money!

That said thought, how will the threat landscape look like over the next 12 months?

Supply chain and third party attacks have been a common feature in 2017 and will continue to be a fruitful attack method for cybercriminals in the next year. These tend to be highly focused operations with predetermined targets of interest, rather than cases of mass, indiscriminate targeting. Nevertheless, the Oracle MICROS breach that affected its point of sale customers and NotPetya campaign were outliers in this regard. This is probably due to the differing motives of these campaigns: supply chain attacks are often done for intelligence gathering and reconnaissance purposes, whereas thee MICROS and NotPetya attacks were financial or disruptive, so the emphasis would have been on widening the number of targets for maximum effect. Suppliers and third parties are often seen as easier entry points for attackers, especially as many do not have adequate security maturity levels. Moreover, suppliers are often given unnecessary wholesale access to company networks, which is why they are targeted in the first place.

Wormable malware - Some of the biggest cyber incidents in 2017 revolved around the issue of self-replicating malware that can spread between networks. WannaCry and NotPetya were examples of this. As well as these we’ve seen the Bad rabbit ransomware that reportedly spreads via a combination of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, and a wormable Trickbot banking trojan was also reported in Jul 2017.

I expect malware modified with self-replicating capabilities to continue in 2018, particularly given the disruption caused by WannaCry and NotPetya inspiring similar attacks. Another driver for this is that many organizations around the world will be slow to mitigate against these methods, whether by applying appropriate patches and updates, restricting communication between workstations, and disabling features such as SMB to reduce the capability of malware to propagate within organization networks.

The bar for cyber-attacks keeps getting lower. The availability of leaked tools from the NSA and HackingTeam, coupled with ‘how to’ manuals, means that threat actors will have access to powerful tools that they can iterate from and leverage to aggressively accomplish their goals.

But whatever happens in 2018 and beyond, what is clear is that cybercrime will continue to be a problem and present governments, businesses and individuals with challenges to protect their data and their intellectual property. It is therefore critical that you take steps to manage your digital footprint and manage the digital risk you present to the World via your business activities in the internet and via cloud solutions. That way, when something bad does happen, you will know quickly and can deal with it more effectively.0

In the year since Santa Forgot first launched, over 200,000 more people in the UK have developed the condition and they’re surrounded by families that may be struggling to cope this Christmas.

Many of us have been close to someone with a parent or someone they love very much in the grip of dementia. I remember visiting the mother of a friend in the very severe stages of dementia and seeing her not recognise her own son. Humans are ultimately social animals and the idea of being isolated from our social networks is as frightening as anything can be. Dementia is one of the most pernicious and unacceptable things that can happen and it can happen to anyone – even those most special to us.

History has shown that dementia is no respecter of persons. Iris Murdoch had one of the greatest minds that the twentieth century ever produced, as a philosopher and a novelist, but she succumbed very quickly and very terribly to dementia. Santa Forgot imagines a world where not even Santa is immune to its devastating effect.

But I have real optimism that with the support of the public, things can change rapidly. What matters to me so much is that Alzheimer’s Research UK is determined to find ways to defeat it so that future generations will only be reading about Alzheimer’s and not experiencing it.

Part of the extraordinary revolution in human congress that has happened since the internet and social media have devoured our lives so much, is that we’ve become far more aware of the social network that connects us and of the stories of how dementia affects people. For me, Santa Forgot is a wonderful way of telling that story and showing the effects of dementia so clearly to people.0

After weeks of complaining that Christmas comes earlier every year, we can finally start preparing for the festivities: hoisting up our Christmas trees, stocking up on seasonal food and decking the halls with boughs of holly.

But in communities across the country, a different kind of Christmas preparation is underway.

New figures published today by The Trussell Trust, the charity that runs a network of over 420 foodbanks across the UK, show that last December there was a 47% increase in the number of three day emergency food supplies given to people compared to the monthly average during 2016-17.

This means December 2016 was the busiest month for Trussell Trust foodbanks on record. Even more worryingly, recent statistics showing a 13% rise in foodbank use during the first six months of this financial year suggest December 2017 will be even busier.

Covering the costs of increasingly cold weather and having children at home during the school holidays make December a difficult time for many people. Pair this with something unavoidable like redundancy, illness or a delayed benefit payment, and you have a recipe for disaster. This is particularly stark, but I remember one mum telling me that as well as food costs, she even worries about how much extra toilet paper she’ll need to buy when her three kids are at home during the holidays.

Can you imagine having to worry about how you will afford the absolute basics like toilet roll and food in the lead up to Christmas?

I’ve been volunteering in foodbanks for several years now. But each year, the stories don’t get any easier to take in. A mum referred on Christmas Eve bursting into tears because the volunteers gave her a teddy bear to give to her son when she’d been expecting to have nothing for him. The parents planning to give their kids beans on toast on Christmas Day and go without themselves, who couldn’t believe it when they were delivered a Christmas hamper so the family could eat together. The young man dealing with a disability who thought he’d be celebrating Christmas alone, cold and hungry, but instead was able to come to a festive community meal held by his local foodbank.

It breaks my heart.

But it also reminds me that I’m not powerless. I have the ability to help make sure people aren’t left hungry this Christmas. We all do. Thousands of people across the UK will be joining me this December, giving food, money or time as volunteers at their local foodbank to make sure help is there for people when it’s most needed.

Last December, support across the country meant foodbanks were able to help thousands of people who would otherwise have faced going hungry at Christmas. This year foodbanks will be building on that work. Many are distributing presents generously donated by the public, to ensure children have something to open under the tree, whilst others are offering Christmas food boxes with festive food or running holiday clubs and community meals to make sure people have a hot meal and company over the Christmas break.

So as we approach what could be The Trussell Trust foodbank network’s busiest December yet, why not join me in a different kind of Christmas preparation? You don’t have to put pause on hunting down that perfectly proportioned Christmas tree – just have a think about what you could do as well. It’s really easy to get involved, here are three simple suggestions:

The Trussell Trust has just launched its Christmas campaign to help raise funds to support its national network of foodbanks: you can find out more here.

You can find out how to help your local foodbank by searching for their website and clicking on the links to “Give help”/“Donate food”.

This weekend foodbanks will be collecting in Tesco stores across the country as part of the nationwide Food Collection - so you can be making a difference whilst doing your weekend shop.

By joining us in our preparations this December, you’ll not only be helping make sure emergency food is available; you’ll be helping bring hope to someone whose Christmas would otherwise have looked very difficult indeed.-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/steven-hopkins/britain-first-conference-that-time-i-was-thrown-out_b_8583194.html?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepageThat Time I Was Thrown Out of a Britain First Conference by Jayda Fransen's Close Protection TeamIt was shortly after a lunch of egg sandwiches and wedges that I realised I was about to be thrown out of Britain First's annual conference, hosted in a private room, in a castle-like hotel, on the outskirts of Sheffield.

I was glad. It was over.

Greed had got me caught.

Acting as an unofficial stenographer, I was delighting in eavesdropping on a conversation to my left between two women which I thought answered the one question I had going into Saturday's conference. What type of person supports Britain First?

A stupid person.

Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen and leader Paul Golding at the party's annual conference

The woman began: "I don't know what he's saying, it goes well over my head. But he's well smart. He uses lots of long words. Like more than three words. I was going to tell him he was well smart but I felt stupid."

At this point supporters had already passed policies including banning Islam in the UK; had decided to leave the UN, and outlawed the word "racism" in the media (it was silencing their voice of reason). The latter prompted my favourite Britain First supporter quote from a man who voted for it, but whose comment was clearly against it. He called out: "We're the human race so we should be allowed to be racist".

Amusingly, the woman wasn't speaking about Britain First leader Paul Golding.

Was the man with the vocabulary a local councillor? An official? An academic? The group pondered, before the woman continued: "He looks like a hoarder. Like he lives in a big house with piles of shit around him." He kind of did.

With the man's standing in the community still unclear, the woman offered some insights into her battle to be heard in an overly-PC, Islama-fied world. It seemed even her son had been radicalised.

He had "come home and called me a racist, which is nice". He was 13, she told the group, that "awkward" age where if "it doesn't have boobs he's not interested".

"I feel sorry for him. He'll understand when he's older," she said.

In the wake of the Paris attacks, paranoia was high. Of the 60-odd guests at the Sitwell Arms Hotel, at least 10 were security guards, dressed head-to-toe in black. Where possible, it seemed, the clothing was all official Britain First merchandise.

Before even getting to the venue I had passed through two re-direction points, been photographed, frisked and had my bag searched.

Weeks before the conference, the Chesterfield Borough Council had cancelled their venue booking, citing "the risk of public disorder". The party could not risk the new venue being compromised.

So at 11.30am, as directed by the conference flyer I arrived at what I thought to be the venue. The Days Inn Hotel, Welcome Break, some 12 miles outside of Sheffield.

I never saw the Days Inn Hotel, but near the carpark three men were dressed all in black. One with a tribal tattoo on one hand, a swallow on the other, and Love And Hate inked across his knuckles, asked for some ID. I gave him my driver's license. He wanted a Britain First membership card. I explained I wasn't a member. The flyer for the event said all "patriots" were welcome - for a £5 cover charge. He knew nothing of the flyer. A fellow security guard whose t-shirt identified him as being part of the "Taliban Hunters" branch of the party handed me a notice. Next stop Main Road, Reinshaw - some 3.6 miles away - "look out for the British flags", the notice informed.

I caught a ride with a fellow conference goer. A Welshman, whose face was hidden beneath a cap, and clouds of smoke from a rollie cigarette he puffed.

I climbed in the back of his two-door Opel Tigra, careful not to dislodge his black suit, which was hanging from a grab-handle. During the journey I learned my driver, who was accompanied by his wife, had driven five hours to attend the conference. He was a flag bearer, "Paul" (Golding) had asked him to be one a year back, due to his time in Belfast. He said the Britain First events get "crazier every time".

We pulled into 136 Main Rd. In an empty car park stood a stocky man who wore a tight blue polo shirt and a tattoo on his neck. Another man, younger, in standard-issue Britain First security wear lingered behind him. On the outer edge of the carpark, a tall man, with a thigh-length navy coat, and a thick black moustache, stood next to a newish-looking XJ Jaguar. I was entering a secret society.

I had the driver's suit in hand. Alas, we were not there yet. "Follow that car," said the man in the polo shirt. I hung the suit back up and off we drove. Some five minutes away, the venue. The Sitwell Arms Hotel. An 18-century building that was formerly a coaching inn.

At the door a pimply security guard of about 20, was turning people away. Paul wasn't ready yet. My driver formalised his dress in the backseat of his car, as the Britain First loyal, began parking-up. The man in the Jag. A woman with an orange face, oversized black and gold sunglasses, and a Union Jack emblazoned bag. There was "Bob from Birmingham" (as I later came to know him), in a blue cap with 'God is Good Always' written on it, and his friend, a small elderly man. Men in black. Men in camouflage. Men with grey hair. A few lads. A few children.

The conference room was upstairs and the line didn't move. The driver, having completed his "Clark Kent", tried to push towards the front. There was no way through.

At the door a security guard took photos of guests from a camera on his lapel

At the top of the stairs, a finely dressed man in a three-piece grey Gibson suit. A fob chain hung from his waist coat. A gold collar-bar, made the knot of his rust-coloured tie sit up. On his lapel a camera. He took my picture. Frisked me. Searched my bag. All for "my safety".

At the door to the conference room Golding's mum checked people's names off a list, if they had pre-registered, and took the entrance fee.

The bar was open. The room was empty. A disco ball hung in the middle of the ceiling between plastic chandeliers. A young-boy, in crisp white shirt and tie, sat at a desk, next to a laptop and projector. A video camera was set-up to record.

Golding later joked about the empty seats, saying he "over-estimates everything". There was more chairs downstairs. Conference-goers were asked to shuffle up, so it looked busier before filming began.

While elected leader, the real-star of the show was Jayda Fransen. A pin-up girl of the far-right, with a mane of purple-hair and tattoos creeping out of her short skirt, suit jacket and heels. She made younger members of her security-detail blush when she addressed them by name. One, Ben, never left her side. Fransen hosted most of the conference and stepped in when Golding was challenged on the wording of policies. She has studied law. The crowd listened to her.

After the first session of three, where the policies were passed, there was a break for lunch.

While taking notes on my phone, I noticed a presence on my shoulder. The conference photographer. Golding examined the viewfinder on his camera. Then he turned and looked straight at me.

It was 3.30pm. My train back to London was at 4.30pm. I needed to leave anyway. I thought I'd leave before I was asked to.

Slinging my bag over my shoulder I walked behind the seating area, past tables heavy with Britain First merchandise which Golding had repeatedly tried to flog before each break. None was bought.

There she was, Fransen, with guards to her left, right and rear. Big white men, with thick tattooed-forearms, and fat stomachs.

"Good, he's leaving," she said.

I was moving quickly now. Arms on either shoulder, driving me towards the exit. There was no time to farewell Golding's mum.

There was no explanation.

I turned right. "Where you going... left, left", the security guard said, directing me there by force.

The stairs where I'd earlier queued. A final shove from the bouncers. I tumbled. Six steps. Three steps. Like lily pads. The exit door. Miraculously I was still on my feet. I'd hate to have been injured, and had to stay.

The hands were back. I was shoved into a row of smoking conference goers. "What the fuck."

It was raining, and I was two re-direction points from the railway station, but it was over and I had my answer.

I had my answer.

Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes of getting Labour “battle ready” for a general election have suffered a setback after local parties failed to meet his Christmas deadline for selecting new candidates in target seats. The Labour leader told the ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) in September that he wanted all 76 key marginals to pick their prospective Parliamentary candidates by the festive season. But a mix of local delays, a shortage of applications and an ongoing nationwide battle between ‘Left’ and ‘centrist’ activists means that just three of the seats have chosen their Westminster candidates so far, HuffPost UK can reveal. Although a handful of other target constituencies are due to select their would-be MPs in coming weeks, the bulk of them will now be decided next year. In some seats, left-backed candidates are finding it more difficult than expected to get chosen by their local parties and their supporters hope the postponements will help them. Buoyed by his June election campaign, which deprived Theresa May of her Commons majority, Corbyn and his leadership team moved swiftly to keep up the pressure on the Government. The Labour leader embarked on a summer tour of key marginals and his office drafted plans, passed by the NEC, to fast-track selections of candidates in preparation for another snap election.

PA Wire/PA Images Jeremy Corbyn at Glastonbury in the summer of 2017.

Glastonbury chief Michael Eavis claimed that Corbyn had told him in June he could be Prime Minister “in six months”. Corbyn allies such as Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry believe that the Tory government could collapse “any day” and the party has to be ready to swing into action. With the polls putting the parties neck and neck, few Tory ministers or MPs want to risk a general election before 2022, even if their party changes leader. Some Labour NEC members warned the leadership that it could be difficult in practical terms to meet an original “guidance” deadline of November 13 for applications for all 76 target seats. Under the initial timetable, a copy of which has been seen by HuffPost UK, constituency Labour parties were advised to draw up shortlists by October 16 and hold hustings meetings ballots by October 30. The latest date for online ballots was mid November.

HuffPost UK

That timetable has now been quietly ditched and local parties given more flexibility to select candidates next year. Momentum-backed candidate Greg Marshall, who cut Anna Soubry’s majority to just 800 votes in June, was selected for Broxtowe earlier this month. Last weekend, ‘centrists’ Cat Atkinson and Sally Keeble were picked by local party meetings in Erewash and Northampton North respectively. Just seven more constituencies among the 76 have set selection meetings next month. Among the December selections are Thurrock, where national teaching union organiser Elly Baker is winning local support, and other swing-seat marginals such as Norwich North and Calder Valley. Many of the seats have a Tory lead of just a few hundred votes. In one example of the current delays, Unite official Mike Hedges was interviewed last weekend but not shortlisted by a local selection committee in the key marginal of Watford. The ruling NEC intervened on Tuesday to add him to the list ahead of a final vote on December 14. A note sent to party members on Monday revealed that scores of the target seats have no deadline at all, including Mansfield, Stevenage, Northampton South, Chingford and Woodford Green, Putney, Pendle and Telford.

PA Wire/PA Images Education Secretary Justine Greening, whose Putney seat is 35 on Labour's target list.

In some areas in England not enough applicants have been attracted to fill a shortlist. Two selections in Wales have had to be postponed due to lack of interest, while the entire Scottish seat list was put on hold until after the party leadership election this month. Some party insiders opposed the fast-tracked plan to select Westminster contenders so early in a Parliament because of the sheer cost of being a candidate for up to four years could deter working class applicants. A review of the 2015 general election by Margaret Beckett found that similar early selections under Ed Miliband had placed an unfair burden on candidates as they rack up travel, accommodation and other costs while holding down a job. Traditionally, prospective Parliamentary candidates (PPCs) were chosen late in a Parliament, often a couple of years before an expected election. But many Corbyn supporters believe the party is in new territory and has to be ready for any collapse of the Tory government, before or after Brexit.

Michael Stone was jailed in 2001 for the killing of Lin Russell, 45, and her six-year-old daughter Megan and is serving three life sentences. Josie, nine, survived but was gravely injured in the frenzied knife attack.

PA Archive/PA Images Michael Stone was convicted of murdering Lin Russell, 45, and her six-year-old daughter Megan.

Bellfield is currently serving a life-sentence for the rape and murder of 13-year-old Milly Dowler as well as the killings of Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. There was no DNA evidence linking Stone to what became known as The Chillenden Murders and his conviction hinged upon the testimonies of three criminals who said he had confessed to them. One later admitted he had lied and another was discredited but the third stood by his testimony. THE MURDERS The attack occurred as Russell and her daughters Megan and Josie walked back from a school swimming gala along a country lane in Chillenden, Kent, on 9 July, 1996. The court heard Stone approached the trio and asked for money, before striking Russell with a hammer at least 15 times. He then turned the tool on Josie, smashing her skull and leaving her for dead. Megan was then hit at least seven times. One of the family dogs, which was with the trio, was also killed. Russell’s husband and the father of the girls, Dr Shaun Russell, was initially told his whole family had been killed in the attack. It was only when a policeman at the scene noticed Josie move that it was realised she had miraculously survived. She was rushed to hospital with “serious life-threatening injuries” including a large puncture mark behind her left ear, several lacerations to her skull and extensive tearing to the covering of her brain.

MICHAEL STONE After a year-long police investigation, heroin addict Michael Stone of Kent, was charged, tried and found guilty of the attack in 1998. Appeal judges quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial in 2001. Stone was convicted for a second time in a trial in which Damien Daley, an inmate in Canterbury prison, claimed he had heard Stone confessing to the killings. In 2004, lawyers argued Stone had not received a fair trial and won the right to a second appeal. In 2005, judges at the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction handed down at his second trial. Stone was sentenced to three life terms and will not be considered for release until 2031. Witnesses told the jury Stone injected heroin several times a day. Other evidence heard was that he had gone to a friend’s house with his T-shirt spattered with blood and that he had burned his clothing after the attack.

THE CONVICTION Stone continues to claim his innocence and several tabloids have named alternative suspects, leading to speculation his conviction could be unsafe. Stone’s lawyer Paul Bacon has requested a review of the case, claiming Bellfield may have been responsible. In 2011 Bacon told the BBC: “Bellfield is 6ft 1in and it was said by Josie that the person was a bit taller than her dad. Her dad was 6ft. Michael Stone is 5ft 7in. “The e-fit, which was composed at the time of the murder is round faced, red faced, ruddy cheeked. If you look at the picture of that e-fit composed in 1996 against the photographs of Levi Bellfield in 1996, there are so many similarities it is untrue. “Compare that e-fit with the long thin face of Michael Stone in 1996 and the differences are startling.” Bacon also pointed out the make and model of the car Josie described as having been at the scene matched that of the beige Ford Sapphire Bellfield was driving at the time. Kent Online cites further sources, one of whom claims a local man who has since died may have committed the murders and attacked Josie. LEVI BELLFIELD Last year Mark McDonald, another member of Stone’s legal team told the Sunday People he and his team had visited Bellfield’s first wife Rebecca Wilkinson and daughter to quiz them about his involvement. He said: “We went to see Levi Bellfield’s wife and daughter to ask them whether or not they had a view on the Russell killings. We knew that he knew the area. We got the impression that he had already considered it and that he was involved in it.

Labour attacked May’s latest “power grab” after it emerged that the Government will deploy a little-used procedural device to effectively eliminate any attempts to amend the Finance Bill.

The tactic will severely restrict MPs’ ability to secure alternative tax measures, such as a DUP-backed plan to abolish VAT on all domestic fuel after Brexit.

It also ensures that no backbench rebels can join Labour or other parties in ambushing the Government on particular plans - as they have in recent years on issues like the ‘tampon tax’ or taxes on solar panels.

The move follows heavy criticism from both Tory and Labour MPs of the Prime Minister’s recent attempts to protect her wafer-thin majority by ignoring Opposition Day motions and packing bill committees with Conservatives.

The change emerged on Monday - just as the media’s focus was on the Royal engagement - on the Commons Order Paper.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/entertainment/the-disaster-artist-review/index.htmlJames Franco celebrates failure in 'The Disaster Artist'(CNN) The idea of achieving immortality through awfulness -- being "So bad, it's good" -- is hardly a new one. Still, "The Disaster Artist" -- James Franco's hyphenated turn as star, producer and director -- deftly falls into that comedic pantheon, joining the likes of "Ed Wood" in making an entertaining movie about a truly terrible one.

The target here is "The Room," the mysterious Tommy Wiseau's 2006 opposite-of-a-masterpiece (or "disaster-piece," per the marketing), which became a can-you-believe-it hit on the midnight-movie circuit. Based on the book co-written by Wiseau's friend and star Greg Sestero, Franco's film painstakingly reconstructs the making of that movie, a process conducted so meticulously that at the end the new movie proudly showcases scenes from the two side by side, using a split screen.

There's a family-affair feel to the whole exercise, with Franco as Wiseau -- adopting a peculiar accent and unkempt mop of hair -- and his brother, Dave Franco, playing Sestero, who is initially caught up in Wiseau's enthusiasm before beginning to grow weary of apologizing for his pal's strangeness.

Seth Rogen -- Franco's frequent co-star -- shares producer credit, and appears as one of the crew members, who are happy to garner a paycheck but positively mystified over what sort of movie their director is making, among other things. (Bryan Cranston, who recently appeared opposite Franco in "Why Him?," also drops by.)

"Hollywood reject us? Then we do it on our own," Tommy tells Greg, capitalizing on his enthusiasm and naivete.

http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/opinions/donald-trump-has-gone-too-far-again-brian-klaas-opinion/index.htmlDonald Trump is giving oxygen to hate groups -- this must endBrian Klaas is a fellow in comparative politics at the London School of Economics and author of the forthcoming book "The Despot's Apprentice: Donald Trump's Attack on Democracy." The opinions in this article belong to the author.

(CNN) The President of the United States woke up this morning and decided to retweet three videos from the account of Jayda Fransen -- the deputy leader of Britain First: a far-right, ultranationalist, neo-fascist hate group.

Britain First organizes "Christian patrols" and "invades" mosques trying to intimidate those who attend religious services.

Trump gave her a platform -- spreading her hateful message to his 43 million followers.

The videos he retweeted paint Muslims as anti-Christian criminals who beat up white kids and break statues of the Virgin Mary. They are clearly aimed at demonizing Muslims, a religious minority that already faces a disproportionate number of hate crimes.

Let's be crystal clear about this: Trump's behavior is sick, disgusting and disqualifying. We are watching, in real time, the President of the United States using his power and platform to mainstream the vile ideologies of racist neo-fascism.

This isn't coming from the political fringe any more; it's coming from the political center of the United States: the Oval Office.

Have you no decency, Mr. President?

The answer, of course, is no -- he does not. But if we continue to accept these reckless, divisive outbursts as part of our normal political discourse, then we will have answered the question as to whether we have any decency left too. We will have failed yet another test.

JUST WATCHED Maggie Haberman: Trump seems unleashed lately Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Maggie Haberman: Trump seems unleashed lately 01:13

Now, just as the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer celebrated after Trump made his now infamous "many sides" comments after Charlottesville -- in which he said there were "very fine people" at a neo-Nazi rally that murdered a peaceful protester -- Trump's retweets have Britain First's racist following celebrating too.

In a year where we seem immune to being shocked by the sheer depravity of Trump's actions, this latest action must shock us.

First off, it's un-American. The First Amendment guarantees religious freedom. After all, the United States was founded by Pilgrims fleeing religious persecution.

Secondly, it's dangerous. During the 2016 campaign, as Trump attacked Muslims and called to ban them from entering the United States, hate crimes against Muslims rose by nearly 20% . That disturbing trend is more likely to continue after the President used his public office to suggest that Muslims are vicious anti-Christian criminal deviants.

Trump's actions also damage American security. When Trump vilifies Muslims, it damages our relationships with Muslim-majority nations -- who already are uneasy about Trump's previous rhetoric.

But it also does serious damage to America's power in the world by alienating allies and forcing them to turn away from Washington. Here in the UK, Britain First is correctly viewed by most as an extremist, racist hate group with no place in British politics. Shortly after Trump's tweets, at least one member of Parliament condemned Trump and said he was not welcome to visit.

The UK has long been America's closest ally, with Brits and Americans fighting and dying together to defeat fascism. Now, Britain is being forced to turn away from the United States in horror as the President promotes neo-fascist hate.

This isn't a drill. Nor is it not some curiosity to shrug at, or look on in disgust as we get on with our days. When are we going to stop this madness?

Congress must grow a spine. Checks and balances only work if people are courageous enough to stand up to a demagogue. A "Decency Caucus" -- those elected officials in both parties who believe in core American values and democratic norms -- should be formed to send a clear message to Trump. No legislation should be passed until he apologizes for promoting the hate-filled bile of a neo-fascist group and takes the tweets down.

Today is yet another low point in a presidency defined by its constant low points. Republicans and Democrats can agree to disagree on taxes, health-care policy or foreign affairs. But we must stand united in opposition to Trump's bigotry, his persecution of religious minorities and his constant attacks on the core values of American democracy.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/28/europe/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-details/index.htmlMeghan Markle intends to become UK citizen after marriage to Prince Harry(CNN) Meghan Markle intends to become a UK citizen, the British royal family has announced, confirming that the American actor's marriage to Prince Harry would take place at Windsor Castle in May next year.

Kensington Palace said that Windsor, a royal residence west of London, had become "a special place for the two of them."

A spokesman said Markle would retain US citizenship through the process of becoming a UK citizen but it was "too early to say" if she would retain dual nationality. The process is expected to take several years.

The wedding is likely to fall after another big royal occasion -- Harry's older brother, Prince William, and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, are expecting their third child in April.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at a photocall to announce their engagement at Kensington Palace in London.

News of the couple's engagement was announced on Monday and came after months of speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their first public appearance as an engaged couple in the gardens of Kensington Palace on Monday afternoon, where Harry told reporters he knew Markle was "the one" from "the very first time we met."

Their first official joint engagement will take place in the city of Nottingham on Friday, where they will greet members of the public together for the first time before attending an event to mark World AIDS Day.

After the wedding, Markle will become the fourth patron of The Royal Foundation, a charitable organization set up in 2009 by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The couple will live in Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, the official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. One of Markle's two dogs, Guy, is already in the UK, while the other, Bogart, is now with friends of Markle's in Canada.

A church wedding

In choosing St George's Chapel at Windsor as the venue, the couple are following in royal tradition. Most recently, the church was the scene of the wedding of Peter Phillips -- son of Princess Anne and cousin to Harry -- who married Autumn Kelly in 2008.

Although Markle has been married before, that will not pose any obstacle to a church wedding as the Church of England permits divorcees to remarry.

The last royal wedding involving a divorcee was a civil ceremony rather than a church marriage. Harry's father, Prince Charles, married Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005 in a town hall in Windsor.

The then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, agreed the arrangements were "consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage."

The Church of England nevertheless allows the remarriage of divorced people "in exceptional circumstances."

Rules state that divorcees must be asked a series of questions designed to ensure "past hurts" have been healed and mistakes learned from.

The couple will wed in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Although Markle attended a Catholic school as a child, she is not a practicing Roman Catholic, so an Anglican wedding will not raise any denominational questions. Kensington Palace said she would be baptized into the Church of England before the wedding.

Current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said Monday he was "absolutely delighted" at news of the wedding. "I have met Prince Harry on a number of occasions and have always been struck by his commitment and passion for his charities, and his immense love for his family," he said in a statement

News of the engagement prompted hopes that Brits might be granted an extra day off on the day of the nuptials. The wedding of William and Kate was declared a special holiday, as was Charles' wedding to Diana and that of his younger sister Princess Anne.

But Downing Street has said that there are "no plans" for a special holiday to celebrate the wedding of Prince Harry and Markle.

It began with a blind date

The couple opened up for the first time about their relationship in an interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain broadcast on Monday evening. They have previously stayed clear of the public eye, opting for evenings at home instead of nights out to avoid media scrutiny, which has times been none too kind to Markle.

The two met for a drink in July 2016 on a blind date, brokered by a mutual friend, whose name they would not reveal, but "it was definitely a setup," Markle said.

A second date was followed by a camping trip to Botswana. "Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me," explained Harry.

"We were able to really have so much time just to connect," added Markle, "and we never went longer than two weeks without seeing each other, even though we were obviously doing a long-distance relationship. We made it work."

It was during a "cozy night" earlier this month at the couple's Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace when Harry proposed, Markle said.

"It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee," she said. "As a matter of fact, I could barely let you finish proposing. I said, 'Can I say yes now?'"

The ring features a stone from Botswana accompanied by two smaller diamonds from the jewelry collection of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana.

Harry wanted to include those on the ring, which he designed himself with a yellow gold band, "to make sure she's with us on this crazy journey together."0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/27/opinions/reps-bipartisanship-in-washington-is-happening-opinion-reed-gottheimer/index.htmlBipartisanship in Washington is actually happeningStory highlights Representatives Reed and Gottheimer write that 48 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle come together nearly every week to find common ground on tough issues

The need for a long-term bipartisan budget agreement couldn't be more clear, they write

Josh Gottheimer, a Democratic representative from New Jersey, and Tom Reed, a Republican representative from New York, are co-chairs of the House Problem Solvers Caucus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.

(CNN) When we tell people back home about the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group we co-chair, it's hard for them to believe that 48 members of Congress -- half of them Democrat, half Republican -- come together nearly every week to find common ground on some of our toughest issues. They'd probably find it equally shocking that, earlier this month, Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin locked arms in their own effort to drive problem solving, not just across the aisle, but across the two chambers of Congress.

This isn't some "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" faux idealism; it's actually happening and there is a growing group of us who believe that progress is more important than partisanship. We believe that getting to "yes" where it makes sense -- on health care, DACA and border security, infrastructure, and the budget -- is more important than obstruction just for the sake of it.

Josh Gottheimer

Rep. Tom Reed

We've heard time and time again that Washington is broken and gridlock makes it impossible for members of Congress to find common ground. But we believe the ground is starting to shift -- and that the public has finally had enough. If you look at a recent Harvard-Harris poll , 91% of Americans would prefer that Democrats and Republicans work together.

Earlier this year, we used this approach to engage our House colleagues in discussions about how to form an organized bipartisan bloc. Eventually, these efforts culminated in creating the Problem Solvers Caucus, the first bipartisan caucus of its kind. Some scoffed. For the better part of the last quarter century, they pointed out, the House of Representatives has been defined by a winner-take-all mentality. The majority holds the gavels and the power, rarely even acknowledging ideas from members across the aisle. So, how would a bipartisan caucus wield any real influence?

But that wasn't their only objection. Even if the Problem Solvers managed to drive bipartisan action in the House, many doubted the Senate would ever follow suit. If the House is dominated by majority rule, then the Senate is known for the fact that one person can stop the body in its tracks. In short, there was little reason to believe we could effectively counteract an entrenched system that drives the majority party to ram through its agenda and compels the minority party to exert maximum resistance.

In Markle, young girls in the UK and US have a role model who is not a princess but an independent-minded feminist and career woman, Merrick says

Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) Just as Princess Diana broke down the stuffiest of royal traditions and conventions, her younger son -- and his new fiancée -- are modernizing the royal family all over again.

Prince Harry's engagement to actress Meghan Markle is not the first to join a senior member of the British royal family with an American, nor with an American who has been married once before. The comparisons between their engagement and that of Edward VIII, who gave up the throne so he could marry divorced American Wallis Simpson, end there, however.

What makes this royal couple different from any other around the British throne is the way Harry has -- with, it seems, the positive influence of Meghan -- broken out of the tight constraints of royal protocol to discuss grief, mental health and to share his searingly honest admission of not always wanting to be a prince.

Harry and Meghan began dating 18 months ago, and so it is surely no coincidence that the prince's transformation from someone who partied hard into a taboo-breaking royal role model has happened over a similar period of time. The watershed moment came in April of this year, when Harry gave an interview to the Daily Telegraph's Bryony Gordon about his battle with mental health problems following the death of his mother 20 years ago.

The significance of this moment cannot be overstated: for the many people who suffer from anxiety, depression and other mental health issues, one of the toughest challenges can often be talking about it openly. It is still, in our modern society of social media sharing, a taboo for many. For a member of the royal family, whose members guard their private lives as closely as their crown jewels, such openness was extraordinary.

http://cnn.com/2017/11/28/us/tampa-killings-seminole-heights/index.htmlTampa killings suspect charged with 4 counts of murder(CNN) After a nearly two-month search, Tampa police arrested and charged a 24-year-old man with four counts of murder in connection to a series of fatal shootings that had terrified residents in the city's Seminole Heights neighborhood.

Howell Donaldson III was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon at a nearby McDonald's after police recovered a gun that they said had been used in the four killings.

Donaldson admitted that he owned the gun but did not admit to the killings, Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said, but police are convinced that they finally caught the person responsible.

"We've had other guns, but we knew this was the one," Dugan said. "Now the work begins to shore up the case and get a full prosecution."

Howell Emanuel Donaldson has been charged with four counts of murder in the first degree, police said.

The arrest came 51 days after the first of four shootings in Seminole Heights, each of which targeted citizens doing ordinary things, like waiting at a bus stop or crossing the street. The four seemingly unconnected victims were each killed -- but not robbed -- while walking alone at night within a half-mile area, police said,leading to fears of a serial killer on the loose.

In the past month, officers swarmed the tree-lined neighborhood, advising residents not to go outside alone, to be alert and keep their porch lights on. Some residents stopped walking their dogs, running outside, going for walks or waiting for the bus alone, saying they no longer felt safe.

Police said they didn't yet know the motive for the killings or why the suspect chose Seminole Heights.

"He was friendly and nice to the cops, but he didn't give us anything, tell us why he was doing it or anything like that," Dugan said.

For weeks, officials had said they were not calling the suspect a serial killer . But on Wednesday, Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said he was proud of the city, which "has now spent the last 51 days dealing with a serial killer."

The arrest

Police said they received a tip on Tuesday around 2:40 p.m. from a McDonald's employee about a man who had a gun in a bag at the fast food restaurant. The McDonald's is about two to three miles from where the killings took place.

Donaldson worked at that McDonald's, Dugan said, and went there earlier in the day. He gave a coworker a gun in a paper bag for safe-keeping, the chief said. The coworker then gave the weapon to a police officer, who called for backup and detained Donaldson for more questioning.

Dugan told reporters late Tuesday night about the arrest of Donaldson, even though they hadn't finished drawing up the charges against him. He said they wanted to get out the news of the arrest quickly to reassure the Seminole Heights community.

"The real goal is to let the people of Seminole Heights be able to get a good night's sleep," Dugan said. "It's been 51 days that they've been terrorized in their neighborhood and it is about letting these families know that we're going to bring this person to justice, and letting this neighborhood get some rest."

Dugan added that police recovered a hoodie and a jacket from Donaldson that might be the same ones worn by the suspect in surveillance video released last month. More lab work is needed on that, but "it's encouraging," Dugan said.

Donaldson is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if he had legal representation.

Suspect was on university basketball team

Tampa Police previously released surveillance video of a person suspected in the killings.

Donaldson attended St. John's University in New York beginning in fall 2011 and graduated in January 2017, according to Brian Browne, executive director of University Relations.

He was a walk-on for the men's basketball team during the 2011-2012 season but never played in a game, Browne said.

His freshman-year suitemate at St. John's said Donaldson introduced himself as "Trai" in the fall of 2011. The suitemate, who asked to not be identified, said they lived in the same suite the entire year, until Donaldson got an off-campus apartment.

When college friends sent the former suitemate Donaldson's mugshot early Wednesday morning, "my mouth dropped," the former suitemate said, still in shock.

"It's just like, what? Not Trai. I just don't see what his motive would be."

His first impression of Donaldson was that he was quiet, although the suitemate admitted that was typical the first few days of school. He said Donaldson had the best manners, dressed very well, and was a sneakerhead.

He said he never saw him angry, and at parties, he said Donaldson was a wallflower.

"[Trai was] just a regular guy," the former suitemate said. "Nothing stood out as violent."

Officials said they still had several unanswered questions about the motive for the killings.

"We're still trying to figure out this person's ties to the neighborhood," Dugan said. "We're not sure why he was in this neighborhood or what his motive is. There's still a lot more to go in this investigation."

Relief in Tampa

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who had visited Seminole Heights last week, said he had seen "firsthand the pain that these crimes have caused across the community."

It's been 51 days and it's time for Seminole Heights to have a good night's rest. pic.twitter.com/USQip4frCt — Bob Buckhorn (@BobBuckhorn) November 29, 2017

"In Florida, we have absolutely zero tolerance for this type of evil behavior and anyone responsible will be held to the fullest extent of the law," he said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Scott thanked Tampa police and other law enforcement agencies for working around the clock to solve the confounding case.

"Why somebody would have it in their mind to go take four individuals' lives, I just don't get it," Scott said. "And I don't know that we'll ever understand."

Buckhorn praised the "tired" law enforcement authorities who had worked 24 hours a day to solve this case.

"Today was a good day. Today, the good guys won. Today, Seminole Heights can sleep," he said.

"Today we begin the healing process. And today, the judicial process starts. And it will end. And I can promise you that when it does end, that this community will be a better place. Because I know where this guy is gonna spend his eternity."

The victims

The victims seem to have been selected at random, leaving the community on edge as the number of unsolved shootings mounted.

Benjamin Mitchell, 22, a full-time student at Hillsborough Community College, was shot and killed at a bus stop in the Seminole Heights neighborhood October 9.

Monica Hoffa, 32, a waitress, was shot and killed October 11. Her body was found two days later in a vacant parking lot.

Anthony Naiboa, 20, who had autism and had just started a temporary job packing relief supplies for hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, was shot October 19 when he accidentally got on the wrong bus and ended up in Seminole Heights.

Ronald Felton, 60, who worked in construction and had three grown children, was shot in the back on November 14.

Family member reaction to arrest

Maria Rodriguez, the stepmother of Naiboa, told CNN she was happy no more people will be harmed.

"We're relieved to a point. Justice has been served so far," she said.

Rodriguez said her family plans to follow the legal proceedings in the case.

"I want to be there because I want this person to get the death penalty," she said.

In late October, Dugan released blurry video of a "person of interest" wearing a hooded jacket casually walking down a street near one of the killings.

The police chief released new video about two weeks ago showing a similar-looking person with the same gait who was present near the last shooting, that of Felton. The person in the video, Dugan said then, had become a suspect.

Based on a witness statement, Dugan initially described the suspect as a black male between 6 feet and 6 feet 2 inches with a thin build and a light complexion. The surveillance images were in black and white.

The suspect was wearing all black and a black baseball cap and armed with a large black pistol, police said.-1

Environmental officials had to euthanize a black bear in Southbury after they said it attacked two miniature horses, killing one.

The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said its EnCon officers were called out to the scene on Saturday afternoon. DEEP confirmed that the 150-pound female bear attacked the two horses, leaving one of them dead.

The horse killed was named Savannah and had been with Frank Moon and her family for 10 years.

"It’s not often that the horses make noise unless they’re hurt and when they scream, they really do scream," Moon said.

Moon said the attack happened after dusk. He said they had just fed the horses when they heard them screaming.

"We did throw something heavy enough that it scared it and it climbed over the fence on the outside," Moon said.

The Moon family said all they could do was watch as the horror played out in what felt like slow motion. The bear sat with its victim, never threatening humans or the other miniature horse still in the barn.

"We stayed, feeling pretty much helpless and useless because there was nothing we could do," Moon said.

When DEEP officials arrived, they did what they usually do when faced with a bear that shows aggression. DEEP officials said they euthanized the bear, which has not been tagged before. The Moon family has mixed emotions about it.

"Savannah was really cute, really lovely, but the bear was just being a bear," Moon said. "It’s not good that that happens, but the bear didn’t do anything wrong in that sense."

Now, there’s just one miniature horse, precious. After living in Southbury for 10 years with no issues, the Moon family is confronting the reality of wilderness.

"I cannot give you the likelihood that I would have thought it was bear," Moon said. "It was so far removed from anything that I thought could happen."

DEEP said a necropsy will be performed on the bear. No other details were released by DEEP.

Miniature horses can live to 25 or 30 years and by nature, they like companions. The Moon family is still considering getting another one.

(Brett Hacker/KCTV5 News)

Animals at Great Plains SPCA and several other area shelters will be sleeping a little more comfortably thanks to a special delivery that was made Monday.

When Scott Poore first saw some floor mats at IKEA, it gave him an idea for shelter animals to sleep on.

The mats are comfortable, absorbent and easy to wash, a far cry from an old thin towel or blanket and certainly much much better than the metal floor of a crate.

Poore started a GoFundMe page for the cause and before he knew it, he had 2,000 mats ready to go.

Poore, with Adopt Don't Shop, says he isn't done yet. He says once every shelter animal has a mat in Kansas City, they're going to set their sights on the state of Kansas.

The family had to make the heartbreaking decision to put Carly down. About a week later, they found themselves in the same situation, only this time it was Sparky.

"Same thing, really lethargic and everything like that," said Dyer.

This time at the vet's office, "he was bleeding internally," said Dyer.

The vet told Dyer there was nothing they could do so the family put Sparky down.

"It was tough because they've been with us. They are our children," said Dyer.

The vet ran a toxicology on both dogs.

Carly's came back with high levels of ibuprofen and Sparky's with anti-freeze.

Dyer was stunned and could not believe his dogs possibly been poisoned.

So he posted fliers in his neighborhood. near 7th Street and Bethany Home Road, to try to get answers.

What neighbors told him had him in disbelief.

"About 18 months ago in the same neighborhood the same thing happened to five dogs in the same neighborhood," said Dyer.

For this dog-friendly community, the news of the possible poisonings has them concerned.

"I think we'd always be cautious about what she is sniffing and eating," said Justin Clowes.

"It’s disturbing and sad on a multitude of levels," said Maren Mascelli.

Dyer has this warning for other pet owners.

"Walk your fence line, make sure stuff hasn't been thrown over the fence when you’re walking down the street. Watch what the dogs are getting into," said Dyer.

The family did not file a police report. Dyer said they were grieving and just didn’t think to do it.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — A prison inmate died after being severely beaten by other inmates, the Colorado Department of Corrections said Tuesday.

Daniel Pena was assaulted Nov. 20 at the Cheyenne Mountain Re-Entry Center, a private prison in Colorado Springs. Pena died Sunday.

The details of Pena’s injuries were not released. The incident did not involve any officers. No suspects were identified.

Pena, 64, was sentenced in August 2014 to four years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree assault in Denver.

The offices of the corrections department’s Inspector General and El Paso County District Attorney are investigating Pena’s death as a homicide.-2

http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/donald-trump-far-right-immigration-videos/index.htmlIs Donald Trump losing control?That's just in the last 48 hours!

Trump is someone who prides himself on a sort of everywhere-all-at-once approach to governance. He throws lots and lots of things at the wall every day --through tweets, public statements and policy maneuvers. He has, from the start of his political career, reveled in thumbing his nose at conventional wisdom and political correctness. He is a provocateur by nature; he likes to get reaction, he likes to freak out the squares.

And yet, the last few days Trump feels even more unmoored than usual. More erratic. More wild.

"Something is unleashed with him lately," Times reporter Maggie Haberman said on CNN Wednesday morning. "I don't know what is causing it, I don't know how to describe it."

JUST WATCHED Maggie Haberman: Trump seems unleashed lately Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Maggie Haberman: Trump seems unleashed lately 01:13

Scarborough was more pointed. "Looks like I picked a good day to stop responding to Trump's bizarre tweets," he tweeted of Trump . "He is not well."

The retweeting of videos that purportedly depict violence being committed against Christians by Muslims is the sort of stuff you might expect to find on the Twitter feed of a local conservative talk radio host rather than the President of the United States.

It is the exact opposite of the efforts made by Trump's two predecessors in the White House -- George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- to avoid painting all Muslims with the broad brush of terrorism. It stokes an "us against them" mentality -- not to mention an anger -- that has traditionally been wholly off limits to presidents. (And the retweets could affect Trump's tenuous efforts to convince the courts -- which have previously cited his comments on Islam -- that he has the power to institute a travel ban from several majority-Muslim nations.)

All you need to know about these retweets is that they are being praised by white supremacist David Duke. "Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death," tweeted Duke . "He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T. Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!"

Then there is Trump's willingness to engage in baseless innuendo spreading -- the sort of stuff you might expect in a gossip tipsheet like " Page Six " but never from the leader of the free world.

Trump's reaction to Lauer's firing -- the result, according to NBC, of "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace" -- was to make suggestions about the personal behavior of other powerful personalities in the NBC orbit. He did this entirely without any sort of facts or substantiation. And, if past is prologue, Trump won't produce any evidence. He will simply besmirch two public figures and then move on.

Which brings us to the fact that the President of the United States is now, again, trafficking in two major conspiracy theories that he himself debunked not more than a year ago.

Trump apologized for the language he used when speaking about women in an "Access Hollywood" tape that emerged in October 2016. He never suggested at the time that the tape was fake. But now, according to The New York Times, Trump is telling associates -- and at least one US senator, that he has doubts about the authenticity of the tape. "We don't think that was my voice," Trump told the senator, according to the Times. ("Access Hollywood" reiterated earlier this week that that tape was 100% genuine.)

And, after five years of promoting the totally false idea that Obama wasn't born in the United States, Trump, last September, gave a perfunctory nod to the fact that, after all of that, Obama was an American citizen . But, apparently he has never totally been convinced of that fact and has taken to raising his lingering doubts about Obama's citizenship even since he has been elected president.

What's most concerning about all of that is the fact that -- even amid this impulse-laden 48 hours -- Trump has also dealt with North Korea's latest provocation via a public statement and spoken with the president of China.

The same man who is stoking conspiracy theories, fomenting gossip and retweeting violent anti-Muslim videos from questionable sources is also on the phone -- almost concurrently! -- with world leaders trying to avoid a war in the Korean Peninsula.

None of this behavior is normal.

But Trump's supporters will argue: that's the whole point! Trump was elected to do things differently. To shake up stodgy old Washington and actually get things done. Unpredictability is the new predictability!

Sure -- but only to a point. What that argument presumes is that this is all controlled fury and contained chaos -- that Trump, deep down, knows exactly what he's doing. That he is operating off of a strategic plan that plays the media and Democrats for chumps even while, somehow, #winning.

But, what if he isn't? ( And all available evidence suggests he isn't .) What if Trump is just spinning ever faster -- lashing out here, issuing a statement there -- as he twirls and twirls and twirls?

What then? And what if there is no one around him willing or able to slow him down or exert a semblance of control?

These are not hypothetical questions given the way Trump has acted since returning from his Thanksgiving break. And they are not inconsequential ones either. We are talking about the man who is in charge of America's nuclear arsenal in an increasingly fraught and tenuous world.-1

John Cornyn strikes optimistic tone on GOP tax effortsWashington (CNN) Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn expressed confidence Wednesday in Republicans' efforts to pass their tax plan, making a distinction between the current GOP legislation and their failed health care effort earlier this year.

"In this case, I do believe all (Republicans who have raised concerns) want to get to yes," the Texas Republican told CNN's "New Day" Wednesday morning. "They have legitimate concerns, and we're trying to get to address those concerns, and I think we passed a big hurdle yesterday ... (by passing it) in the budget committee."

The full Senate will vote on whether to take up and start debate on the tax bill Wednesday, setting up a final vote, which Republican leaders hope will be by the end of this week.

Cornyn said the bill will have to pass by "razor-thin margins" because of Democrats' refusal to work with the GOP.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, told "New Day" earlier Wednesday that Democrats are being kept out of the bill's crafting process as it's being "written in a back room" by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and special interest groups.

Trump Jr. met with Senate Judiciary Committee staff in September

(CNN) Donald Trump Jr. has agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as soon as next week, giving lawmakers their first opportunity to question President Donald Trump's eldest son over his contacts with Russians during the campaign season, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the matter.

Trump Jr.'s highly anticipated testimony, scheduled for December 6, comes as he has faced growing questions on Capitol Hill about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower where he met with Russian operatives after being promised dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have interviewed several of the participants in the meeting, including on Tuesday when the House panel questioned the Russian translator, Anatoli Samochornov, who also attended the Trump Tower session, sources said.

But Trump Jr.'s appearance will be one of the most anticipated events yet of the investigation, particularly in light of new revelations of correspondence he had with WikiLeaks during the campaign season.

Trump Jr.'s attorney declined to confirm or deny that his client would appear at next week's hearing, which is expected to occur behind closed doors. Trump Jr. has denied any wrongdoing.

THE VAN JONES SHOW COMING TO CNN IN JANUARY 2018

VAN JONES AND CNN TO ALSO LAUNCH A NEW CNN ORIGINAL SERIES

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Nov. 27 – Beginning in January 2018, CNN political commentator Van Jones will launch a one-hour prime-time program, airing bimonthly on CNN – The Van Jones Show.

Jones will return to CNN with his unique take on the forces that elected Donald Trump, the anti-Trump “resistance” movement and the future of both major parties.

The show will build on Jones’ successful town halls throughout 2017, The Messy Truth, and will continue to speak directly to voters across the country by exploring the raw, emotional policy debates and culture wars taking place in America.

Jones will introduce viewers and a live studio audience to the fresh and charismatic voices on the front lines of political fights across the country.

In addition to The Van Jones Show, CNN has green lit the production of a new CNN Original Series in collaboration with Citizen Jones, a production company. Hosted by Van Jones, the series focuses on reconciliation, hope and redemption within the criminal justice system.

Jones is a notable advocate for civil rights, ecological solutions and social justice. A Yale-educated attorney, he gained nationwide notoriety during the 2016 presidential election with his unique ability to speak to and connect with voters on both sides of the aisle. His most recent New York Times bestselling book, Beyond the Messy Truth, explores failures of both political parties before and after the election of Donald Trump. In his book, Jones advocates for the importance of principled bipartisanship to solve real problems.

In addition to the TV airings, The Van Jones Show will stream live for subscribers via CNNgo (at CNN.com/go and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Samsung Smart TV and Android TV) and on the CNN mobile apps for iOS and Android. The series will also be available the day after each episode on demand via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps.

A 17-year-old boy, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, recalled the scene outside the Sufi mosque as the massacre began. "I saw a man in army uniform," he said. "He opened fire on us. The bullets were ricocheting off the walls, hitting people in the legs and back."

When the attackers left, he went inside to search for his father among the dead. "He was on his side. It looked like he was shot up close in the head when he was already down," he said.

He and others who spoke to CNN said the entire incident lasted roughly an hour.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/29/news/economy/tax-reform-puerto-rico/index.htmlGOP tax bill 'devastating for Puerto Rico,' San Juan mayor saysThe mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, has a message for House Republicans: Your tax bill would crush us.

"It's devastating for Puerto Rico," Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told CNNMoney on Tuesday. "It would kill any chance we have of putting together a plan for sustained growth that would repopulate the island."

The House GOP bill has a provision that Puerto Rican leaders say amounts to a tax on goods manufactured on the island and exported to the mainland United States.

The bill would apply a 20% excise tax to payments made by companies on the mainland to their subsidiary businesses in Puerto Rico. Companies on the island are already considered foreign corporations, even though they're operating in a U.S. territory and employing Americans.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Tuesday that details about how the bill would affect Puerto Rico were still being worked out.

"There are a list of options we're working through to try to arrive at the best approach," he said.

Related: U.S. general leads troops out of Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico is struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria, and only 56% of the island's power is back up and running two months after the storm hit.

Yulin said the timing of the tax plan couldn't be worse.

"You have to wonder, what mind thinks that imposing a tax on goods and services in a economy that's in a coma, it's going to help?" she said. "That is a mind that really does not take into account the needs of the Puerto Rican people."

People were already fleeing Puerto Rico because of an 11-year recession. Many experts say the recession was triggered when Congress killed tax breaks that Puerto Rico offered companies as an incentive to operate subsidiary businesses there.

The damage caused by Maria could exacerbate the departures. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York estimates that as many as 213,000 Puerto Ricans will leave the island because of the hurricane.

That population decline, coupled with the potential tax bill, would make it hard to maintain the island's nearly 70,000 manufacturing jobs. Most of those jobs are in Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical industry. Leaders fear an increased tax burden, on top of the hurricane recovery problems, would cause companies to leave the island.

Related: Puerto Rico kills $300 million contract with Whitefish

Yulin and Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello don't always see eye to eye on politics, but they do share an opinion on the tax reform.

"If the purpose of this tax reform is to bring back jobs to the United States, one must emphasize that Puerto Rico is part of the United States and because of that the island can't be considered as a foreign jurisdiction," Rossello said in a statement on Monday.

Tax experts aren't sure why Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are considered foreign countries under the tax code, even though their residents are Americans. Some surmise that the provision in the House tax bill wasn't meant to affect the island.

"Nobody thought about Puerto Rico. ... It's just an accident that the issue is arising," said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Related: How a month of nightmares changed Puerto Rico

Others believe lawmakers will change the language so Puerto Rico isn't hit hard.

"I don't think there's anyone in Congress that wants to crush Puerto Rico," says Cate Long, an expert on Puerto Rico's debt crisis.

Yulin, the mayor of San Juan, isn't so confident. She praised Democratic leaders like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for hearing Puerto Rico's concerns. But the tax bill has been drafted entirely by Republicans.

"The Republican leadership has said, 'We're going to change it, we're going to change it,'" Yulin said. "But it doesn't change. And there's been enough time already to time change it."-1
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/27/news/economy/china-crackdown-pollution-economy/index.htmlChina takes economic hit as environment nears 'point of no return'Beijing wants to swap its polluted air for blue skies. Doing so will be costly.

China has transformed over the past four decades from an economic backwater to an unrivaled industrial power that consumes huge amounts of raw materials and energy. The tremendous change has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, but also polluted the country's air and water.

"The environment is near the point of no return," Alex Wolf, an economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in a recent research note.

China's economy has long taken priority over other concerns. Local governments tasked with meeting ambitious growth targets have historically kept the furnaces burning at massive state-owned businesses even when there's no demand for their products.

But Beijing recognizes that the situation is now dire. Air pollution killed more than 1.1 million people in China in 2015, the most in any country in the world, according to a study published this year by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute.

Related: Beijing's smog: A tale of two cities

President Xi Jinping repeatedly mentioned the environment during a major speech to fellow members of the ruling Communist Party in October. Tommy Xie, an economist at OCBC Bank, said that Xi's use of the word "green" -- 15 times in total -- means the "whole nation's mentality shifts."

"People in China, including local government and corporates, have now realized that environmental protection is no longer talk only," Xie said.

The government has already undertaken initiatives to promote clean energy vehicles and sideline polluting industries. Beijing has signed the Paris Climate Accord and is working on a plan to eventually phase out cars powered solely by fossil fuels.

The moves reflect the growing desire in the country for the government to help improve citizens' quality of life, experts say.

"Chinese people are very concerned about pollution, so it makes sense for the leading party to respond," said Wei Yao, an economist at Societe Generale. "What's most important to [the party] is social stability."

The changes are coming at the expense of economic growth, which has dropped from above 10% in 2010 to below 7% in recent years.

Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said that China has recently intensified its war on smog. He predicts the efforts will knock 0.5 percentage points off GDP growth -- a loss of about $56 billion -- in the final quarter of this year.

Related: China is winning 'arms race' for electric cars

The efforts are on full display in Beijing and nearby areas in the country's industrial heartland, which have been among the hardest hit by air pollution. The capital and cities in its orbit have been tasked with slashing harmful air pollutants by 25% before the end of the year.

China has put inspection teams to work across the region in an attempt to curb production at the most glaring rule violators. Some 180,000 companies are expected to be hit, according to Societe Generale figures.

Related: The Xi Jinping economy: What's next for China?

There are signs that the measures are starting to bite.

In Hebei, a province near Beijing, the owner of a glass factory told CNNMoney that sales had fallen about 15% this year as a result of the environmental crackdown.

The owner, who would only identify himself by his surname of Li, said that the government had ordered him to upgrade to cleaner machinery, which had disrupted production. He spent 8 million yuan ($1.2 million) on the equipment, which is still awaiting approval from regulators.

The question is whether authorities are willing to stick with the measures as the economic pain increases. When China's economy wobbled early last year, Beijing loosened some environment rules in order to stoke the fires of growth.

Societe Generale's Yao said the government must strike a balance between cleaning up the environment and protecting jobs.

"The pace of implementing the anti-pollution moves is the critical element," she said, warning that the government could risk mass unemployment if it moves too quickly. That's not happening so far, she said, as workers laid off from state-run businesses have mostly found other work.

Related: These countries want to ditch gas and diesel cars

Analysts generally agree that China's economy is strong enough to handle more disruption -- for now.

But should growth dip too sharply, the government may ease the pressure on big polluters.

"China's reform process has never been a straight arc," Xie said.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/28/investing/bitcoin-hits-10k/index.htmlBitcoin just blew past $11,000. What next?There's no stopping bitcoin right now.

The virtual currency has powered past $11,000 for the first time, capping a jaw-dropping rally of more than 1,000% since the start of the year.

Long shunned by regular investors as a murky domain for cranks and criminals, bitcoin (XBT) has gained growing mainstream acceptance this year, helping propel its value higher and higher.

It's been smashing through milestones at an increasing rate: it soared above $8,000 just over two weeks ago and only passed $9,000 for the first time over the weekend. By Wednesday morning in New York, it was trading as high as $11,200.

Its stratospheric rise this year has prompted warnings of a bubble. But experts say that the gains in recent weeks have been driven by the expectation that more major investors -- like hedge funds and asset managers -- are gearing up to start investing in the digital currency.

Related: Russia eyes cryptocurrency dominance

Next month, investors should be able to start trading bitcoin futures via the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is expected to give the virtual currency more legitimacy among professional investors. Futures allow traders to bet on the future price of assets like currencies, metals and agricultural commodities.

Bitcoin is one of many cryptocurrencies that have proliferated in recent years. Unlike the dollar or the pound, these virtual "coins" aren't tied to a central bank. Instead, they are "mined" by computers using complex algorithms.

The decentralized nature of bitcoin is what appeals to many of its enthusiasts and unnerves a lot of its skeptics.

It also makes it harder to settle arguments about whether the currency's huge gains this year amount to a bubble. Unlike stocks, its value isn't based on earnings or dividend payouts, and unlike bonds it doesn't pay investors a steady stream of income.

Related: Bitcoin costs as much as $13,000 in Zimbabwe

And the global market for bitcoin, at nearly $190 billion, is still relatively small. The S&P 500 stock index, for example, is worth more than $20 trillion.

"What is the fundamental value of bitcoin? No one knows the answer to this question," said Arthur Hayes, CEO of Hong Kong's Bitmex, a bitcoin derivatives exchange.

Experts said previously that the $10,000 mark would be a key milestone for the digital currency. Hayes and other industry insiders are predicting that the publicity surrounding bitcoin will continue to lure big investors and push prices even higher.

"Institutional investors ... will begin to pull the trigger in 2018," he said.

Related: Can anything stop bitcoin?

The virtual currency has famously attracted the derision of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who called it a "fraud" that would "eventually blow up." Warren Buffett has also expressed skepticism, warning of a "real bubble."

But other leading figures in finance have defended it. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein pointed out last month that "folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold."

Bitcoin's stunning ascent this year hasn't been particularly smooth.

In September, it plunged as much as 20% after the Chinese government cracked down on offerings in the digital currency, prompting bitcoin exchanges to close their doors.

Earlier this month, it plummeted by up to 30% within the space of a few days, before quickly bouncing back, after it appeared traders were switching to rival cryptocurrencies.0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/28/investing/social-stock-exchange-positive-impact/index.htmlSocial Stock Exchange: London market trying to change the worldStock markets are often driven by fear and greed. Not this one.

For sure, the Social Stock Exchange (SSE) in London is trying to raise funds for companies and make money for investors. But its companies must also fix social problems or improve the environment.

"The organizations that pass our vetting process and meet [our] listing requirements are then free to trade," the Social Stock Exchange says.

The SSE has seen rapid growth since it launched with just 12 companies in 2013. Today it has nearly 50, including MagneGas (MNGA), a cleantech company based in Florida, which joined the exchange earlier this month.

Thanks to its partnership with NEX (NEXGY), a U.K. regulated exchange that focuses on electronic trading, the SSE operates like a traditional stock market, allowing investors to buy and sell shares.

"From seed investment through to IPO and secondary listings, the Social Stock Exchange is able to cater for all fund-raising and visibility needs of those companies that fit its admission criteria," the SSE says.

The London exchange claims to be the only regulated market in Europe offering investors the chance to trade shares in companies committed to a better world.

The SSE says that ability to buy and sell shares is key to encouraging more people to put money into impact investing and social enterprises.

Other platforms, such as Canada's Social Venture Connexion (SVX), are taking a more cautious approach.

"The question for the future is how SVX can manage that secondary market, changes in value of shares and so on," said Adam Spence, director of SVX. "We need to look at the technological, regulatory and even moral implications of a secondary market in impact investments. That will take a few years."

SVX launched its online platform in 2013, connecting investors with qualified social enterprises that are not listed on a stock exchange but want to raise money via private share placements or crowdfunding.

Spence says the idea took root in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

"It was the early days of recession and we saw a huge need for capital to solve problems like inequality, climate change and so on. So we started to look at ways to mobilize capital," he explained.

Before companies can raise capital on SVX, they are assessed on the impact of their products or services. One of its members, Komodo OpenLab, recently raised $500,000 Canadian dollars ($390,000) to finance a device that helps people with mobility problems.

Impact investing is also growing in Asia. Bangladesh-born entrepreneur Durreen Shahnaz has set up the Impact Exchange, a public social stock exchange, and Impact Partners, a platform for private placements and crowdfunding to help social enterprises raise capital.

The former banker and media executive says she's building a "pipeline of high-impact enterprises" that she hopes will eventually list on the exchange.1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/28/politics/north-korea-missile-launch/index.htmlNew missile test shows North Korea capable of hitting all of US mainlandWashington (CNN) North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, topped with a "super-large heavy warhead," which is capable of striking the US mainland.

The country's state media made the announcement Wednesday, hours after leader Kim Jong Un ordered the 3 a.m. launch of the Hwasong-15 missile, which reached the highest altitude ever recorded by a North Korean missile.

State news agency KCNA called its so-called new missile "the most powerful ICBM" and said it "meets the goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development.

After the launch, Kim said North Korea had "finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force," according to KCNA.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis said earlier the missile launched demonstrated North Korea had the ability to hit "everywhere in the world."

The launch was the first since September, and came despite repeated warnings from President Donald Trump who told reporters at the White House after the launch that the US "will handle" the situation.

"We will take care of it," the President said.

The Hwasong-15 soared 4,475 kilometers (2,800 miles) in the sky, spending 53 minutes in the air, before splashing down in waters off the coast of Japan, North Korea said. The figures tallied with estimates released by Japan and South Korea.

Mattis, who was with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, outlined how much tougher that situation has become. The test missile, he said, went "higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken" and demonstrates that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now has the ability to hit "everywhere in the world basically."

"The bottom line is, it's a continued effort to build a threat -- a ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace and certainly the United States," Mattis concluded.

David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists said that if the missile hadn't been lofted into the sky and had flown on a standard trajectory, it would have been capable of traveling 13,000 kilometers, or 8,100 miles.

"Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any part of the continental United States," Wright said in a statement, though he noted that range probably wouldn't be possible if the missile were fitted with a heavy nuclear warhead.

The missile was launched from the west part of North Korea and is likely to have landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, according to Masaki Hikida, public relations officer at Japan's Ministry of Defense.

The flight time would suggest that this was a major ICBM test "possibly in operational settings" and should "disabuse US officials from thinking military displays, sanctions, or threats are deterring North Korean tests," according to Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.

"Today's test proves that Pyongyang still feels able to test at will," he told CNN, adding it also shows the Trump administration "has to get serious about deterring an atmospheric nuclear test."

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho had hinted in September that Pyongyang could carry out an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean, possibly by strapping a warhead atop a missile or dropping it from an airplane.

Condemnations

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson strongly condemned the launch and called for redoubled international pressure on Pyongyang, saying that the US "remains committed to finding a peaceful path to denuclearization." But he added a lightly veiled warning about limited US patience.

"Diplomatic options remain viable and open, for now," Tillerson said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that, "If we have to go to war to stop this, we will. If there's a war with North Korea it will be because North Korea brought it on itself, and we're headed to a war if things don't change."

On Wednesday, a North Korea official reiterated comments made to CNN in October that there would be no diplomacy until the country has proven its nuclear capabilities.

The official added the two steps needed to achieve this goal were the "testing of a long-range ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile)" capable of reaching the US, followed by an above-ground nuclear detonation.

"Before we can engage in diplomacy with the Trump administration, we want to send a clear message that the DPRK has a reliable defensive and offensive capability to counter any aggression from the United States," the official said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Prior to today's launch, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had warned of devastating consequences if the US takes military action against North Korea. Pyongyang can batter Seoul with a barrage of conventional weapons, putting millions of South Koreans and more than 28,000 US troops stationed there within range.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking from Tokyo, issued a warning of his own. The latest missile launch, he said, "significantly undermines the strong determination of the international community's peaceful resolution of the issue."

International diplomacy swiftly kicked into high gear, with US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley requesting an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council with her counterparts from South Korea and Japan. That meeting is set to take place Wednesday afternoon.

Carrots and sticks

Meanwhile, Tillerson announced that the US and Canada will convene a meeting of nations that contribute military forces to the UN Command that supports South Korea to discuss "how the global community can counter North Korea's threat to international peace."

For decades, multiple US administrations and international coalitions have tried and failed to curb Pyongyang's nuclear program, whether they've used carrots or sticks. Sometimes, North Korea has taken the carrots -- aid and greater access to the international system -- and still continued its program.

Sanctions, the latest round of which the US announced on November 22 , seem to have made little difference in curbing North Korea's resolve to obtain nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.

The Center for International and Strategic Studies, which closely monitors North Korean launches through its Beyond Parallel initiative, said historical data shows that Pyongyang is set to significantly ratchet up its testing in the first half of 2018.

South Korea demonstrated some of its efforts to prepare for North Korean hostilities on Tuesday. The country's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the South Korean military had carried out a "precision missile strike drill" just minutes after North Korea's launch.

The precision missile strike matched the flight distance of the North Korean missile and landed in waters off the east coast of South Korea, effectively showing North Korea it can hit the exact location where Pyongyang launched the Hwasong-15.

"Our army, navy and air force jointly fired three missiles (a ground-to-ground missile, a ship-to-ground missile and an air-to surface missile) and hit the same target around the similar time to show its ability to target North Korea's origin of provocation," said Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Park added that Moon and Trump spoke on the phone for about 20 minutes.

'On hair trigger alert'

The point, Mattis told reporters in Washington, was "to make certain North Korea understands that they could be taken under fire by our ally."

Mount of the Federation of American Scientists said the South Korean goal was to show the North that "it has the ability to hit the North's mobile missile launchers or leadership targets."

"It is a measured and pointed response but also a reminder that the peninsula remains on hair-trigger alert," he told CNN. "In this situation, provocations or even mistakes could quickly escalate out of control."

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Twitter that Trump "was briefed, while missile was still in the air, on the situation in North Korea."

North Korea has launched missiles at an unprecedented rate in 2017, testing two in July that also demonstrated intercontinental range.

Before Wednesday's test, North Korea had fired 22 missiles without active warheads during 15 tests since February. US officials say North Korea is continuing to develop its missiles, rocket fuel and engines, as well as targeting and guidance systems.

The US and South Korea believe Pyongyang may be able to put a miniaturized warhead on a missile sometime in 2018 -- giving it the theoretical capability to launch a missile with a warhead atop it that could reach the US.

It is currently testing a more advanced version of its existing ICBM, a US official told CNN earlier this month.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/asia/north-korea-missile-guide/index.htmlA guide to North Korea's missiles(CNN) North Korea's recent missiles tests show it's capable of sending rockets higher and farther than ever before.

Pyongyang's arsenal ranges from short-range Scud-like missiles, to large intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) that may be capable delivering a nuclear warhead to the US mainland.

As soon as a missile test is announced, analysts examine the flight of the missile and its trajectory to work out what type of armament was fired, and the potential lessons North Korea could be gleaning from the test.

Here are the most commonly used North Korean missiles, based on tests conducted throughout 2017.

Hwasong-15

Range: Estimated 13,000 kilometers (8,100 miles)

Length: Unknown

Type: Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)

Little is known about the Hwasong-15, which was tested for the first time on November 29, according to North Korean state TV. It set a new height record for a North Korean missile of 4,475 kilometers (2,800 miles) over a distance of 950 kilometers (600 miles).

A government statement said the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is a new type of "ballistic rocket tipped with (a) super-large heavy warhead which is capable of striking the whole mainland of the US."

It said the system was more advanced that the Hwasong-14, which was tested in July . With the Hwasong-15, North Korea had met its "goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development," the statement said.

While North Korean ICBM tests have demonstrated significant potential range, experts have cast doubt on the country's re-entry technology, and whether the missiles could fly anywhere near as far topped with a heavy nuclear warhead.

Hwasong-14

Estimated range: 10,400 kilometers (6,460 miles)

Length: 19.5-19.8 meters

Type: Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)

Following a test in July, a combination of US, South Korean and Japanese analysis showed the missile flew about 45 minutes, going 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) high and for a distance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).

Also referred to as the KN-20, the Missile Defense Project (MDP) says it is a two-stage, liquid-fueled missile capable of carrying a high explosive or nuclear payload. MDP gives a slightly lower range estimate but one that would still put parts of the US West Coast and Alaska within reach.

Hwasong-12

Estimated range: 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles)

Length: 17.4 meters

Type: Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)

An intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the Hwasong-12 has an estimated maximum range of over 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles), which would put the US Pacific territory of Guam within its strike capability.

According to MDP , testing of the Hwasong-12, also known as the KN-17, has only succeeded around 50% of the time.

A test in April 2017 "flew a distance of 60 km and reached a height of 189 km before starting to 'pinwheel,' landing into the Sea of Japan after 9 minutes of flight time," MDP said.

Musudan/Hwasong-10

Estimated range: 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles)

Length: 11.5 meters

Type: Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)

Another IRBM, the Musudan doesn't quite have the range of the Hwasong-12, topping out at around 3,500 kilometers (2,170 miles), according to NTI

Unlike its larger Hwasong cousins, the Musudan is believed to be road-mobile , making detection of potential launches more difficult.

However, despite over a decade of development and repeated tests, the Musudan "barely works," aerospace and rocket expert John Schilling told CNN in January 2017.

Of eight tests between 2016 and early 2017, seven failed according to South Korean and US assessments (though North Korea claimed some as successes or partial successes).

Taepodong-3/Unha-3

Estimated range: 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles)

Length: 30 meters

Type: Space launch vehicle (SLV)

Alongside its intercontinental and intermediate-range missile programs, North Korea has also developed several long-range rockets designed primarily to deliver satellites to space.

In the past, Pyongyang had been accused of using this program to covertly test ICBMs and other weapons technology, though the North Korean government always insisted its space program was peaceful and focused on putting scientific satellites into orbit.

Given the open testing of ICBMs and intermediate-range missiles, some analysts have suggested the two programs, if they were ever one, are now "moving on separate tracks."

The Taepodong-3, also known as the Unha-3, is a three-stage satellite launch vehicle, with an estimated range of 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) with a 1,000 kilogram (2,200 pound) payload, and a maximum range of around 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles), according to MDP.

While the Unha-3 is believed to be primarily non-military, MDP said it is "still possible that North Korea could use the Taepodong-3 as an ICBM and launch an untested re-entry vehicle in the direst of circumstances."

Scud missiles

Estimated range: 500 kilometers (310 miles)

Length: 12.18 meters

Type: Short-range ballistic missile (SRBM)

North Korea has a number of short- to medium-range missiles based on the Soviet Scud type design which dates back to the end of World War II.

Though Scuds typically carry conventional explosives, they could also be armed with nuclear warheads. Due to their much smaller size, they can also be fired from mobile launchers, making them harder to track and predict.

At a military parade in Pyongyang in April 2017 , North Korea revealed the KN-18, which MDP estimates has a demonstrated range of around 450 kilometers (280 miles) but may be capable of up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).

Other North Korean Scud variants have demonstrated this range, such as four which were fired into the sea near Japan in March 2017 , after flying over 1,000 kilometers.

Nodong/Rodong

Estimated range: 1,500 kilometers (930 miles)

Length: 16 meters

Type: Medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM)

As well as the short-range Scuds and long-range ICBM or IRBMs, North Korea also has several medium-range missiles which can be fired from mobile launchers and may be capable of delivering nuclear or chemical payloads as well as conventional high explosives.

The Nodong, one of North Korea's oldest missile designs, has a range of around 1,300-1,500 kilometers (800-930 miles), according to NTI

Also known as the Rodong, the missiles capabilities are such, according to MDP, that it "can only effectively be used against large, soft targets like cities, airports or harbors."

"Its range is sufficient to put parts of Japan within striking distance," the group said in a report

"However, the accuracy is extremely low for modern missiles and likely ineffective against hardened military targets, unless it was equipped with a nuclear warhead."

Submarine-launched missiles

Estimated range: 1,200 kilometers (745 miles)

Length: 9 meters

Type: Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM)

While preparations for ICBM or IRBMs are quite labor intensive and may be detected by intelligence services or satellites, missiles launched from mobile platforms or submarines are another matter altogether

The Pukkuksong-1, also referred to as the KN-11, is North Korea's main submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), with an estimated range of around 1,200 kilometers (745 miles), according to MDP-1

But Henry Charles Albert David Mountbatten-Windsor -- fifth in line to the British throne and better known as Prince Harry -- will have few places to hide after the announcement that he is engaged to his American girlfriend Meghan Markle.

Born on September 15, 1984, Harry was the second and last child born into the ill-fated marriage of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.

The pair divorced in 1996, and Diana died a year later. Not yet a teenager, Harry walked behind his mother's coffin in images broadcast to a global audience.

Harry took up a place at the school his mother chose for him, the prestigious Eton College -- following in the footsteps of his older brother, Prince William.

After leaving Eton, he traveled the world before enrolling at Sandhurst military academy in Berkshire, England. His nickname there was "Harry Potter," according to Lieutenant Kayon Mills, who trained with the prince. After completing the course he joined the Blues and Royals regiment of the British Army.

http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/asia/china-kindergarten-abuse-scandal/index.htmlChina child abuse scandal: Police accuse parents of making claims upBeijing (CNN) A child abuse scandal that has rocked China took a shocking turn Tuesday, as police accused two parents for fabricating tales of their children being drugged and molested at a Beijing kindergarten.

The police statement claimed that one father coaxed his child into saying they'd been given pills and that one mother, who'd told reporters her daughter was inspected by naked strange men, had made up her story and was ready to clarify her words and apologize to the public.

Doctors and experts examined the alleged victims and found no indication of molestation, the police said. Police claim to have recovered 113 hours of surveillance camera footage from the RYB Xintiandi kindergarten and found no evidence of child abuse.

A hard drive in which videos had been stored was damaged because a control room employee "often forcibly turned it off after school hours" to keep the noise level down, the police said in the statement.

Teacher detained

Police had previously detained a 22-year-old female teacher for her alleged role in the reported child abuse. She was said to have poked children who refused to take a nap with sewing needles as "punishment," according to the latest statement. Chinese police usually withhold the full names of suspects. They gave her surname as Liu.

Police said they had also detained another woman for "rumor mongering," accusing her of posting fabricated information online about the involvement of military personnel in the incident, which prompted an unusual denial from the country's defense ministry.

RYB Education representatives ring the New York Stock Exchange opening bell on the company's first day of trading in September.

RYB Education, the Beijing-based and New York-listed company that runs the kindergarten, apologized again to the children and to the public in a statement released Wednesday, expressing "sadness" and "shame." The company stressed its policy of "zero-tolerance" regarding child abuse and vowed to take concrete action to earn the public's forgiveness.

"If children were harmed in our facility, we will not evade responsibility," it said. "We will correct our mistakes, shoulder our responsibility and bear the legal consequences."

Over the weekend, the company said it fired both the detained teacher and the head of the kindergarten, promising to provide psychological counseling to the victims, upgrade safety measures in its facilities and set up an independent supervision system.

CNN's repeated phone calls to the company went unanswered Wednesday and attempts to reach the parents were unsuccessful.

Multiple allegations

Amid city-wide kindergarten safety checks, Beijing's education authority has also announced a plan to hire an inspector at every kindergarten.

But the latest developments don't appear to have quelled intense nationwide debates about the incident. It has sparked public outrage, parental soul-searching, government pledges and widespread online censorship.

The story broke last week after numerous parents accused RYB Xintiandi of drugging and molesting their children.

In a video posted on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, the mother who police now say was lying, said at least eight parents told the authorities that their young children had fallen victim to abuse and molestation while attending the school.

The video was viewed millions of times before being deleted from Weibo.

The unidentified mother told reporters last week that her 3-year-old daughter said she was injected with a brown liquid by a teacher and made to strip along with other children before being "examined" by a naked adult male stranger.

She said she and other parents allegedly found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies, adding that the kindergarten and the police had not allowed them to review videos from the school's surveillance cameras.

"My child said the teacher told them it was a secret and they were not supposed to tell anyone else, including parents," the mother said. "She now bursts into screaming at night, saying, 'I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?'"

RYB Education, whose share price plummeted on the New York Stock Exchange last week , had its stock price rebound in Tuesday's trading and closed up more than 23%. The company told investors last Friday that it would buy back shares worth up to $50 million.

The company and its franchises operate in approximately 300 Chinese cities and run about 1,300 daycare centers and 500 kindergartens around the country.

Shock and censorship

When CNN tried to visit the RYB Xintiandi kindergarten last Friday, it was relatively quiet around the campus with some parents and onlookers gathering outside the gate where a corporate statement was posted.

One grandfather, who had just picked up his granddaughter but declined to be named, told CNN that the 4-year-old mentioned her classmates being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret.

Another resident of the neighborhood who gave his surname as Liu said the kindergarten is the best in the area and costs as much as 5,000 yuan ($750) a month for bilingual class students. He said he was furious at the news, but believes those were isolated cases.

Past incidents involving RYB kindergartens included two cases in northeastern China, where four teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing 17 children.

Parents take photos of a notice posted by the RYB kindergarten announcing measures taken in response to allegations of children abuse in Beijing, China.

Amid an unrelenting outcry by the public over the scandal, Chinese government censors appear to have moved to contain the fallout. Many users have complained that their posts on the subject have disappeared from social media. The comment section for many online news reports on this story are disabled.

Zhang Quanling, a former anchor at state broadcaster CCTV with more than 11 million followers on Weibo, echoed the sentiment of many when she re-posted the police statement Tuesday night along with a sarcastic note.

"The stock price for the surveillance equipment maker should take a dive," she wrote. "What brand is it?"

Her post attracted hundreds of comments before it was removed.

Across Chinese cyberspace, parents of young children have started sharing tips on detection and prevention of child abuse and molestation -- some directly copied from school literature in the United States.

Earlier this month, videos of teachers at a Shanghai kindergarten physically attacking kids and force-feeding them what appeared to be mustard went viral. Shanghai police quickly detained several employees at the facility, while the agency involved had to apologize to the parents and to the public.

Critics have argued for many years that China's laws are too vague and lax on child abuse and sexual molestation cases.

Media in China have documented a rising number of incidents of abuse at childcare facilities, often in small cities and towns. In a lengthy investigative piece published last year, the state-run Xinhua news agency said 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/10/05/opinions/north-korea-mazarr-opinion/index.htmlOn North Korea, past foreign policy fiascos show US what not to do (Opinion)Michael Mazarr is a senior political scientist at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. This article was originally published October 5, 2017.

(CNN) The powerful recent PBS documentary on the Vietnam War offers a timely lesson about the sources of foreign policy disasters. They often follow a common, tragic script, built around two fundamental mistakes: untested assumptions about the need to act, and wishful thinking about magical schemes to act without consequences. And what's so disturbing today is that the US seems to be following the same script in the unfolding Korea crisis.

Modern foreign policy fiascos -- whether the war in Vietnam or the US invasion of Iraq or even the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan -- often begin with a sense of false urgency. In Vietnam, it was the domino theory (the theory that a communist takeover in one nation would lead to the collapse of other pro-Western governments nearby) and the obsession with defending every inch of global ground in the Cold War contest for supremacy.

In Iraq , it was the post-9/11 conviction that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was cooperating with terrorists. In the case of Moscow's lurch into Afghanistan , part of the motivation was a sudden and obsessive conviction that the CIA was trying to topple the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul.

All of these assumptions turned out to be wrong. Vietnam's fall did not trigger a line of communist dominoes. Saddam had no WMDs and feared al Qaeda almost as much as the United States. The CIA had a very limited role in Afghanistan in 1979. In each case, more precise facts and interpretations were widely available even at the time. But facing strategic and political imperatives to act, national leaders did not take the time to assess them.

Once a nation is convinced of the need to do something fast, it then often makes a second mistake on the way to disaster: It brushes aside the risks and costs of the escapade by concocting some scheme to avoid the worst outcomes. In Vietnam, the scheme eventually became graduated escalation: Successive US administrations put their faith in hitting North Vietnam progressively harder until it buckled, which it surely would -- long before the US got dragged into a quagmire. In Afghanistan and then in Iraq, Moscow and Washington used versions of the same basic scheme: We're going to go in, displace the government, and then get out, fast and clean.

Foreign policy disasters are often the sum of these two basic errors: Embracing exaggerated claims about the need to act, and inventing a conceptual magic wand to wish away potential consequences. Both are increasingly apparent in US policy toward North Korea's nuclear aspirations.

The assumption driving the perceived need to act is that a nuclear-armed North Korea with missiles that can reach the US is unacceptable. This could be true -- if Kim Jong Un hoped to start a war once he got them, or if his control of the arsenal was so flimsy that missiles might be fired at random. There is little evidence to support either of those propositions, however.

North Korea has actually been mostly restrained since the infamous 2010 attack on a South Korean navy corvette and subsequent artillery attacks, with the exception of a 2015 land-mine incident , and most experts believe that the main obsession of North Korean leaders is regime survival . A reckless drive south, using the nuclear arsenal as a sort of geopolitical suicide vest, would destroy that goal.

In fact, there is good historical reason to believe that an alternative approach can work: Deterrence, combined with a long-term effort to transform the regime in the North. That was the US Cold War strategy, adopted after Washington rejected heated demands for pre-emptive war against either the Soviet Union or China. Deterrence has worked in Korea since 1953. With help from China and Russia -- in the limited but critical sense of broadcasting zero tolerance for North Korean aggression -- it should be able to work in the future.

The second mistake is then to invent a scheme that wishes away the risks of pre-emptive action. In the case of Korea, the analogy to graduated escalation or the quick-exit proxy strategy is a notion of "limited" military strikes , attacks that would degrade the North's nuclear capabilities and send a message without provoking general war.

Such a scheme could work. One of the problems in recognizing an unfolding disaster is that there is always a chance the wishful plan could actually succeed. But the idea of limited strikes in Korea depends on a range of uncontrollable forces , from the reaction of local North Korean military officers to Kim Jong Un's emotions. It is a shot in the dark rather than a strategy whose means and ends are tightly linked. Much like graduated escalation in Vietnam, it depends on largely untested, and ultimately unverifiable, assumptions about the adversary.

At a minimum, the existence of these two symptoms of an emerging tragedy demands a far more intense national debate before the United States acts. And it suggests that two especially critical questions should be at the forefront of that debate: Is the alternative to action really unacceptable? And will the proposed course of action truly sidestep calamitous results?-1
http://cnn.com/travel/article/bresse-chicken-france/index.htmlBresse chicken, found in France, is world's most expensive(CNN) — A tiny town in eastern France may seem a long way to travel for a plate of chicken, but it's worth it.

I've come to the Michelin-starred Aux Terrasses in Tournus to taste one dish in particular -- roasted chicken breast strips with a tabbuleh malted barley garnish and an onion stuffed with mushroom sauce.

The breast is on the large side, its juicy flavor a million miles away from supermarket blandness. The white meat is soft but firm, under a thin, brown-seared skin that lacks excessive fat.

As for the gravy pot, I'm tempted to drink it on its own.

My taste buds are exploding -- and they should be. Because I'm eating volaille de Bresse, the most expensive chicken in the world, commanding a cool €40 per kilogram ($48) in the butcher shops of Paris.

High quality

Chef Jean-Michel Carrette took over his father's business in 2005 and has kept Aux Terrasses' Michelin star in tact with an imaginative and bold menu.

"I like to use Bresse chicken and I'm in luck because the quality of the local produce is the highest the world," he says.

Bresse chicken is the favorite of Michelin chefs, as well as French Presidents. François Hollande would have nothing else served at his table and Emmanuel Macron is also said to be an ardent fan.

The chickens are raised in the historic region of Bresse, a former French province. As France only exports 5% of its production, you'll likely have to travel here to savor its taste.

The next day Marie-Paule Meunier, from the Committee of Promotion of the Bresse Poultry offers a history lesson in the charming market town of Louhans, considered the capital of Bresse chicken, as we eat in an expressly certified brasserie.

The original corn-fed chicken

Bresse chickens have a white body, blue legs and a red crest. John Malathronas

"Unlike many foods and recipes that are lost in the mists of time, the history of the Bresse chicken can be traced easily through an abundance of documents detailing how the farmers paid their rent in chickens and how they gifted them to invading armies," she says.

"The first mention is registered in 1591 and tells us how the citizens of Bourg-en-Bresse offered two dozen birds to the Marquis de Treffort for having routed the troops of Savoy."

"In this region, between the rivers Doubs and Saone and below the Jura mountains, the cultivation of maize started soon after its arrival from the New World."

Volaille de Bressem it seems, is the original corn-fed chicken.

Its fame spread in the 19th century aided by the fact that the breed of white chickens (the Bresse de Bény variety) it is produced from matches the colors of the French flag -- blue legs, white body and red comb.

The ultimate accolade came 60 years ago, when the Bresse chicken became the first live foodstuff to obtain a protected designation of origin certification (AOC) now valid across the European Union, something usually granted to items like Champagne, Parma ham or Stilton cheese.

Raising Bresse

Bresse chicken feed is a mix of corn, wheat and desiccated milk. John Malathronas

There are around 180 farms rearing Bresse chickens in a legally defined area of Bresse.

The Laurency family farm , which lies seven kilometers from Louhans, raises 20,000 Bresse chickens a year.

"Not only must a certificated chicken be reared in Bresse, but also only eat food grown in the region," says Anthony, the youngest farm hand while pointing out the chickens foraging freely in the fields; by law they must have 10 meters of area each.

He shows me the feed they have just mixed: "700 kilograms of our own corn to 300 kilograms wheat grain, topped by 7% desiccated milk.

"The feed is intentionally poor in protein so that the birds must forage for insects, worms or snails as well as grass to supplement their diet."

Their muscle must be turned into fat before they reach our tables, so they're rested in wooden cages called "épinettes" in rooms with low diffuse light while they eat, dream and chill out.

The farm buys chicks from a centralized selection center that guarantees the purity of the breed -- which was nearly extinguished in the flames of World War II.

Chicks arrive when they are just a day old and cost $2.40 each, unlike other breeds you can buy for just 35 cents a piece.

Most Bresse chickens are slaughtered by the time they are four months old, while the larger "poulardes" -- females on the verge of ovulating -- are allowed to live one month longer.

The biggest and most precious of them all is the capon, a castrated rooster that must "go through all seasons."

Chicks who are to be raised as capons usually arrive in February. They're then castrated in April and slaughtered in time for Christmas.

Top poultry rearer

Most Bresse chickens are matured for around four months. John Malathronas

December is the time of the region's major agricultural fete dating from 1862, the Glorieuses de Bresse.

This is a series of four one-day events in four different market towns, with prizes for the top chicken farmers.

In a profession that's traditionally female orientated -- men used to toil the fields while women reared the chickens -- breeder Rachel Roussel-Voisard is a trailblazer.

On December 15, 2007 she became the first woman to receive the top poultry rearing prize, a blue Sevres vase in the Glorieuses at Louhans.

In her farm, outside the village of Chapelle-Voland at the feet of the Jura mountains, everyone works for the chickens.

Roussel-Voisard grows her own maize and has a flock of Charollais sheep keep the grass trim like a golf cours. The neighbor's cows provide milk and Cassis the cat hunts mice to keep the coops free of vermin.

I watch as she performs a "roulage," one of the region's traditions.

She takes a recently slaughtered, plucked capon and wraps a white linen cloth around it.

With a trussing needle and string, she sews what can only be described as a legless diaper with only the neck sticking out.

She keeps on stitching without piercing the skin, pulling very tightly and pushing out the air.

This is an ancient preservation technique; as the dead bird is in no direct contact with air, it can keep for up to three weeks in a cold store.

The tight wrap also helps distribute the fat evenly, however Roussel-Voisard thinks there's more to it.

"It's not just for conservation, aesthetics and taste, but it's also a mark of respect for the animal itself," she says.

Pharmacists will be trained to consult with patients before providing the drug

(CNN) The United Kingdom will be the first country where consumers can buy the drug Viagra without having a prescription, the drug's maker, Pfizer, announced Tuesday.

The UK's regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, said the reclassification moves the erectile dysfunction drug from a prescription-only medication to a pharmacy medication.

The move is expected to help clamp down on unregulated sales of the popular drug.

"Erectile dysfunction medicines are a popular target for criminals selling unlicensed and counterfeit medicines," the regular agency said in its announcement. In the past five years, it has seized more than $66 million (50 million British pounds) in unlicensed and counterfeit medicines for erectile dysfunction, it said.

"Making this medication more widely available will help direct men who might not otherwise seek help into the healthcare system and away from the risks that come with buying medicines from websites operating illegally," the announcement said.

http://time.com/5041046/norh-korea-ballistic-missile-test-donald-trump/?xid=homepageTrump Threatens North Korea Sanctions After Missile Test(WASHINGTON) — President Donald Trump threatened new sanctions on North Korea Wednesday after its most powerful missile test yet and urged China’s leader “to use all available levers” to convince its wayward ally to “return to the path of denuclearization.”

It was not immediately clear if Trump was referring to additional U.S. sanctions or another around of penalties at the United Nations. Agreement between the U.S. and China, both veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council, is key to such action. The council is due to hold an emergency meeting Wednesday afternoon.

Trump tweeted that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about “the provocative actions of North Korea. Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today. This situation will be handled!”

After a 2 ½ month pause in its rapid tempo of nuclear and missile tests, North Korea said it launched a “significantly more” powerful, nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile. Outside governments and analysts concurred the North had made a jump in missile capability.

Some observers believe the Hwasong-15 missile that was tested on a high trajectory and splashed down in the Sea of Japan in the early hours of Wednesday in Asia could potentially reach Washington and the entire eastern U.S. seaboard.

That suggests progress by Pyongyang in developing a weapon of mass destruction that could strike the U.S. mainland. Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea from having that capability — using military force if necessary.

A White House statement about the phone conversation between the U.S. and Chinese leaders said Trump made clear “the determination of the United States to defend ourselves and our allies.” Trump also “emphasized the need for China to use all available levers to convince North Korea to end its provocations and return to the path of denuclearization.”

China’s state-run Xinhua news agency said Xi told Trump that denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, maintaining international nuclear-nonproliferation regime, and preserving peace and stability in Northeast Asia are China’s unswerving goal.

Xi said China would like to keep up communications with the United States and all other related parties, and “jointly push the nuclear issue toward the direction of peaceful settlement via dialogues and negotiations,” according to Xinhua.

U.S. sanctions against North Korea were bolstered last week after the Trump administration declared North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism. Those sanctions targeted North Korean shipping and Chinese companies that deal with the North.-1

A Massachusetts man who collected about $76,000 in donations for fake charities that he claimed helped child cancer patients, injured veterans and firefighters has avoided jail.

Prosecutors say 26-year-old Zachary Noonan was sentenced Tuesday to three years’ probation and ordered to pay restitution and seek mental health treatment.

Authorities say Noonan once worked for an advertising company that solicited funds for nonprofits. After his employment ended, he continued soliciting money for fake charities that in many cases had names similar to legitimate charities.

Prosecutors say Noonan kept most of the money for his own use and no funds were ever used for their intended purpose.

http://time.com/5038985/grammy-awards-2018-nominations-jay-z/?xid=homepageGrammy Awards 2018: Jay-Z Leads with 8 NominationsNEW YORK — Jay-Z is the leader of the 2018 Grammy Award nominations in a year where the top four categories are heavily dominated by rap and R&B artists, giving the often overlooked genres a strong chance of winning big.

The Recording Academy announced Tuesday that Jay-Z is nominated for eight honors, including album, song, and record of the year. Bruno Mars is also nominated for the big three, while Kendrick Lamar — who earned seven nominations — and Childish Gambino are also up for major awards.

Jay-Z’s personal and revealing album, “4:44,” is nominated for album of the year alongside Mars’ 90s-inspired R&B adventure “24K Magic,” Lamar’s hard-hitting rap masterpiece “DAMN.,” Gambino’s funk-soul project “Awaken My Love!” and Lorde’s critically acclaimed pop album, “Melodrama.”

Record of the year nominees include Jay-Z’s “The Story of O.J.,” a song about blackness and managing money that also references O.J. Simpson; Mars’ Top 5 hit, “24K Magic”; Lamar’s No. 1 smash, “Humble”; Gambino’s “Redbone,” which peaked at No. 12 on the Hot 100; and the year’s biggest hit, “Despacito,” by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber.

“Despacito” is also nominated for song of the year — a songwriter’s award — along with Mars’ No. 1 hit, “That’s What I Like”; the title track from Jay-Z’s “4:44”; rapper Logic’s suicide prevention anthem, “1-800-273-8255”; and “Issues” by Julia Michaels, the singer who has written hits for Bieber, Selena Gomez and other pop stars.

Michaels is also nominated for best new artist, where R&B and rap rule again: Her competition includes singers SZA, Khalid and Alessia Cara, as well as rapper Lil Uzi Vert.

No rock or country acts were nominated in the top four categories. The rap- and R&B-heavy nominations, which include numerous black and Latino artists, come after the Grammys were criticized earlier this year when some felt Beyonce’s multi-genre “Lemonade” album should have won album of the year over Adele’s “25.” Adele also expressed that Beyonce should have received the prize.

The win for Adele, though, marked another year when the Grammys awarded its biggest prizes to an artist outside of the rap or R&B genre. Kanye West, Eminem, Mariah Carey and others have also lost in the top categories over the years to pop, rock and country acts despite owning the year in music, critically and commercially.

“We have a current membership that is savvy and certainly timely, is current, and reflective of what music is about today and in the future. And clearly the diversification work that we’ve done for our membership is evident in all of the nominations this year,” Neil Portnow, the academy’s president and CEO, said in an interview. “I think it’s a testimony to our hard work and intention of having a very vibrant, current, relevant, diverse voting membership.”

Jay-Z or Lamar could make history next year when the Grammys take place in New York City on Jan. 28, 2018: Either album could become only the third rap-based album to win album of the year; and either song could become the first in the rap genre to win record or song of the year.

“4:44,” which includes songs about Jay-Z’s relationship with Beyonce and family life, marks the rap icon’s first nomination for album of the year as a lead artist; it is Lamar’s third in the top category. Lamar will compete with Jay-Z in all seven categories he is nominated in, including best rap album, best rap song, best rap performance, best rap sung performance and best music video.

Mars is behind Jay-Z and Lamar with six nominations, including best R&B album, best R&B song and best R&B performance. Gambino, better known as Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning actor Donald Glover, scored five nominations.

Others who earned five nominations include SZA, Khalid and No I.D., who produced Jay-Z’s album and is up for non-classical producer of the year.

Ed Sheeran, who has the second best-selling album of the year with “Divide,” was snubbed in the top categories. “Divide” earned a nomination for best pop vocal album, while his No. 1 hit, “Shape of You,” is up for best pop solo performance.

Nominees for best pop vocal album include Lady Gaga’s “Joanne,” Coldplay’s five-song EP “Kaleidoscope,” Imagine Dragons’ “Evolve,” Lana Del Rey’s “Lust for Life” and Kesha’s “Rainbow,” marking her first Grammy nomination. Kesha, who has been in a legal war with former mentor and producer Dr. Luke, is also nominated for best pop solo performance for “Praying.”

Leonard Cohen and Chris Cornell are both nominated for best rock performance; other deceased nominees include Glen Campbell, Gregg Allman and Carrie Fisher, who is nominated for best spoken word album, where Bernie Sanders, Mark Ruffalo and Bruce Springsteen are also nominated.

In the country categories, Chris Stapleton leads with three nominations. Miranda Lambert, who earned two nominations, was surprisingly shut out of best country album though her double album, “The Weight of These Wings,” was a critical favorite.

Others who earned multiple nominations include Pharrell, Ledisi, Nothing More, Alison Krauss, Daniel Caesar and Foo Fighters. Randy Newman’s song “Putin,” his sardonic ode to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is nominated for best arrangement, instruments and vocals.

Taylor Swift, who didn’t earn nominations for her single “Look What You Made Me Do” — released before the Grammy cutoff date — did earn a nod for best country song for writing Little Big Town’s No. 1 hit, “Better Man.” Swift is also nominated for best song written for visual media for “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” her collaboration with Zayn from the “Fifty Shades Darker” soundtrack. Her new album, “reputation,” will qualify for nominations at the 2019 Grammys.

Cardi B, who had one of the year’s biggest hits with “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),” earned two nominations: best rap song and best rap performance. Another female rapper scored nominations, too: Rapsody is up for best rap song for “Sassy” and best rap album for “Laila’s Wisdom.” In the latter category, she will compete with Jay-Z, Lamar, Migos and Tyler, the Creator. Snubs include Future, J. Cole and DJ Khaled, who has two of the year’s biggest hits with “Wild Thoughts” and “I’m the One.”

Albums and songs eligible in the 84 categories at the 60th annual Grammys had to be released between Oct. 1, 2016 and Sept. 30, 2017. This year is the first year the Grammys used online voting for its main awards show; it started online voting for the Latin Grammys last year.

http://time.com/money/5040083/morning-routines-hard-adopt-pay-off/6 Morning Routines That Are Hard to Adopt But Will Pay Off For LifeThe early birds will inherit the earth.

At least that’s what a 2009 University of Leipzig study found. The researchers concluded that “morning people were more proactive than evening types.”

But being an effective early riser isn’t just about waking up before everyone else. It’s about putting yourself in a positive mindset and getting important things done before everyone else.

So there’s no point in setting your alarm clock at a crazy-early time if you’re just going to zone out in front of the television for a bit before slouching off to work.

To start your day right, you’ve got to get into some good habits.

Following are six morning rituals that may seem hard to adopt but will ultimately reap major rewards, if you stick with them.

Make a plan the night before

This isn’t a morning ritual per se, but it’s a habit that’s definitely conducive to a productive morning routine. So make sure to set yourself up for a successful morning by creating a game plan the night before.

It’s always helpful to have everything you need for the day laid out and ready to go when you wake up. Make sure you’re stocked on whatever you need for breakfast. Write out a little schedule on what you need to accomplish the next day.

This all sounds pretty simple, but when you’re getting home at night, it’s very tempting to just crash on the sofa with a glass of wine and leave all the thinking for tomorrow.

Wake up painfully early

Sorry, night owls. It’s time to adapt.

In a poll of 20 executives cited by Laura Vanderkam, a time-management expert and the author of “What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast,” 90% said they wake up before 6 a.m. on weekdays. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, for example, wakes at 4 and is in the office no later than 7. Disney CEO Bob Iger gets up at 4:30 to read. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is up at 5:30 to go jogging.

Yes, this might sound awful, but if you get to sleep earlier, that’ll numb the pain of such early wake-ups over time. The bottom line: Productive mornings start with early wake-up calls.

Start the day right with exercise

Yeah, there are super humans among us who crave that pre-sunrise workout (that, or they’re just really good liars). Still, for everyone else, waking up at the crack of dawn to sweat and get sore probably doesn’t sound ideal.

But the morning is probably the ideal time to exercise. By starting your day with exercise, you’ll prevent yourself from putting it off.

Think about it this way: If some of the busiest people in the world can find time to workout, so can you. For example, Vanderkam notes that Xerox CEO Ursula Burns schedules an hourlong personal-training session at 6 a.m. twice a week.

US President Barack Obama starts out each day with strength and cardio training while Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey does three repetitions of a seven-minute workout, Anisa Purbasari reported for Business Insider.

“These are incredibly busy people,” says Vanderkam. “If they make time to exercise, it must be important.”

Tackle your high-priority projects

The quiet hours of the morning can be the ideal time to focus on an important work project without being interrupted. What’s more, spending time on it at the beginning of the day ensures that it gets your attention before others — kids, employees, bosses — use it up.

Vanderkam uses the example of a business strategist who dealt with so many ad hoc meetings and interruptions throughout the day that she felt she couldn’t get anything done. She started thinking of the early mornings as project time, and chose a top-priority project each day to focus on. Sure enough, not a single colleague dropped in on her at 6:30 a.m. She could finally concentrate.

Work on your side hustle

Your side project is easy to skip when you’ve been in meetings all day, are tired and hungry, and have to figure out what’s for dinner. That’s why many successful people put in an hour or so on their personal projects before they officially start their days.

A history teacher at the University of Chicago told Vanderkam that she spent the hours between 6 and 9 working on a book about the religious politics of West Africa. She was able to read journal articles and write several pages before dealing with her teaching responsibilities.

By carving out the time in the morning to write, and making it a habit, she could follow through.

She’s not in bad company. According to the Telegraph, Ludwig Beethoven, John Milton, Kurt Vonnegut, Maya Angelou, and Victor Hugo all tackled their creative projects in the morning.

Enjoy the silence

Life can get crazy. It’s often hard to find any moments to spare in your busy schedule. If you’re always rushing around in the morning, it’s difficult to imagine being able to spare any time to have a quiet moment.

But practicing mindfulness isn’t a waste of time. Try to reserve a few minutes for silent contemplation at the start of every day. You can use those peaceful moments to pray, meditate, envision your future success, or reflect on what you’re grateful for — whatever works for you. That short pause can put you in a great mindset for the rest of the day.

"This drop in gold came when GDP surprised to the upside, the dollar started to rally and yields moved higher," Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.

"The drop in physical demand has made gold very, very sensitive to the U.S. dollar and U.S. bond yields. There is basically nothing else that is driving the gold market this year."

Gold has risen 12 percent so far in 2017, bouncing chiefly in the first quarter as it clawed back some of its losses posted towards the end of 2016 in the run-up to the second U.S. interest rate increase in a decade.

It is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

While another rate increase is expected next month, fears for more aggressive hikes have receded. Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell said in his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday that gradual rate increases would be the best way to sustain the U.S. recovery.

Geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe-haven assets such as gold, but the metal took little support from news overnight that North Korea had tested a new type of intercontinential ballistic missile.

A lack of clear drivers means that gold has traded between $1,265 and $1,300 throughout November, its narrowest monthly range in 12 years.

"When you have a period of low volatility, it's actually quite difficult to break out of that," Oxford Economics analyst Daniel Smith said. "Low volatility tends to mean low volatility going forward, (and) you need something fairly major to shock things out of their ranges."

"In terms of gold, you would need some kind of shock probably around inflation, or interest rates, or some major political event. But it does feel as though it's going to be drifting into year-end."

Among other precious metals, palladium was down 1.32 percent at $1,013.95 an ounce, after reaching its highest since February 2001 on Tuesday at $1,028.70.

Silver was down 0.71 percent at $16.711 an ounce, while platinum hovered around $948 an ounce.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/iraq-urges-extension-of-opec-oil-deal.htmlIraq urges extension of OPEC oil deal for another nine monthsThe Iraqi oil minister has repeated his call for an extension to a cap on global oil supplies and added that the deal would not need any mid-term review.

OPEC and countries outside the cartel, such as Russia, will meet in Vienna Thursday to consider whether an existing curb on supply, should be extended by nine months.

The current agreement runs out at the end of March and Jabar al-Luaibi, Iraq's oil minister, said Wednesday that any mid-stream review was unnecessary.

"No, no. The existing declaration (will) finish at the end of March. So we extend this another nine months, so that means it will end by the end of 2018," said Al-Luaibi.

Al-Luaibi added that while he was happy with the current price of oil he was also keen it didn't encourage others to overproduce.

"We are happy with $60, maybe a little bit more than $60, but we have to be careful about the effect on the other side of the river," the minister said.

The price of oil collapsed from near $120 a barrel in June 2014 due to weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production. OPEC's reluctance to cut output was also seen as a key reason behind the fall. But, the oil cartel soon moved to curb production — along with other oil-producing nations — in late 2016. The oil exporters then extended that agreement through to March 2018.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/zimbabwe-coup-china-benefits-from-president-emmerson-mnangagwa-post-mugabe.htmlZimbabwe coup: China benefits from president Emmerson Mnangagwa post-MugabeSince Mugabe assumed power in 1980, Beijing has fostered intimate political, military and personal ties with the controversial politician, providing his government with interest-free loans — a relationship that's resulted in hefty Chinese investments within Zimbabwe's tobacco, diamond and power industries.

China has backed Mugabe even as he was slammed in the West for despotic rule — in 2008, Beijing vetoed a United Nations resolution that would have imposed an arms embargo and financial restrictions on the African leader.

But links have soured as of late. Mugabe's indigenous law, which requires foreign companies to have majority black Zimbabwean ownership or face the risk of closure, was a major source of tension as it endangered Chinese commercial projects. Mugabe's move to nationalize Zimbabwe's diamond mines also irked Beijing, whose state-owned companies are major players in local diamond fields.

"As Zimbabwe's largest source of foreign investment, Chinese investors are inevitably impacted ... dissatisfaction is rampant among many in China, who question the solidity and future of the special friendship between the two countries," said a 2016 Brookings report.-1
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/saudi-prince-miteb-bin-abdullah-freed-after-1-billion-settlement-deal.htmlSaudi prince freed after reportedly paying more than $1 billionSaudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, detained earlier this month in a corruption crackdown, has been released after paying authorities more than $1 billion for his freedom, according to media reports.

Once seen as a contender to the throne, Prince Miteb was among hundreds of other political and business figures rounded up in a sudden anti-corruption purge at the start of November.

The 64-year old cousin of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was said to have been released on Tuesday after reaching an "acceptable settlement agreement," Reuters reported, citing a government source who could not be verified by CNBC. News agency AFP also quoted a source close to the government revealing details of the release.

The amount of the settlement was undisclosed but according to the reports, Prince Miteb was understood to have paid an equivalent of more than $1 billion for his freedom.

At least three other people have reportedly reached settlements with the Saudi government.

Saudi officials have been looking to strike deals with some of those in detention, asking for them to hand over assets and cash in exchange for their freedom.

In some cases, the Saudi government had been seeking to appropriate as much as 70 percent of a suspect's wealth, the Financial Times reported in mid-November. The settlements have the potential to channel hundreds of billions of dollars - allegedly accrued through corruption – back into depleted state funds.-1

The new ICBM, called the Hwasong-15, was ordered by leader Kim Jong Un and is the country's the most powerful missile so far, according to a televised broadcast. It added that the nation's missile program will not threaten any country as long as they do not infringe on North Korea's sovereignty.

The statement also confirmed details about the Hwasong-15 launch, which it described as successful: The device was fired at a lofted trajectory, hit an altitude of 4,475 kilometers and flew 950 km during a 53-minute flight. These statistics were already known by the international community.

In July, Pyongyang tested an ICBM known as the Hwasong-14 that was believed to be capable of hitting a bit more than half of the continental U.S.-1
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/chinas-toilet-revolution-will-give-domestic-tourism-boost-xi-says.html'Toilet revolution': China has its sight set on reforming its bathroomsAmid sweeping new regulations that have targeted everything from financial market liberalization to tightening internet controls, China has its sight set on reforming one additional domain: its toilets.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday brought attention to a national drive to upgrade toilets in the country by calling for sustained efforts in building clean restrooms in both urban and rural areas, state news agency Xinhua reported.

Xi said that doing so would boost the domestic tourism sector as well as standards of living, Xinhua added.

Launched in 2015 by the local tourism administration, China's three-year "toilet revolution" plan has reportedly resulted in 20 billion yuan ($3.03 billion) being sunk into installing and improving 68,000 toilets located at tourist destinations across the country, according to the China Daily.

Upgrading those facilities was important even though toilets were a "seemingly petty issue," a Xinhua editorial said.

That was because some public restroom facilities in rural regions remained "little more than makeshift shelters surrounded by bunches of cornstalks, while others [were] open pits next to pigsties," leading to unhygienic living conditions.

According to state mouthpiece Xinhua, Xi had spoken to rural residents about the standards of toilets in the countryside and later reiterated that hygienic toilet facilities were needed to build a "new countryside."

Aside from improving sanitation, the campaign also aimed to increase the number of "three-star-rated" public toilets at popular tourist areas, the China National Tourism Administration previously said. According to authorities, toilets are given star ratings based on some 58 variables, including ventilation, background music and whether or not toilet paper is provided.

The call for clean toilets also gives a boost to the growing domestic tourism industry as unhygienic restrooms had "long been a big put-off for visitors," Xinhua said.

Xi also reportedly called for enhanced public facilities to be built to support development in domestic tourism, a move that plays into Beijing's years-long attempt to rebalance its economy from a manufacturing-led model to one driven by services.

Ahead, China intends to build or renovate 64,000 toilets at tourist sites between 2018 and 2020 according to local media.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-report.htmlNorth Korean missile lands in Sea of Japan, Pentagon saysPentagon on North Korea missile: We are assessing the situation 22 Hours Ago | 01:45

North Korea on Tuesday fired a missile that traveled about 1,000 kilometers before crashing into the Sea of Japan, the Pentagon said in a statement.

The Department of Defense said that initial assessments indicated the missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In a news conference, Japan's Defense minister also said it seemed to be an ICBM.

The missile went higher than any shot North Korea had previously taken, according to Defense Secretary James Mattis.



Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered an emergency meeting of Cabinet ministers following the launch, North Korea's first since Sept. 15, when one flew over northern Japan and into the Pacific Ocean.



"A missile was launched from North Korea which appears to have landed within Japan's exclusive economic zone," Abe's office tweeted. "As soon as new information comes in, we will let you know."

The exclusive economic zone is a legal designation established by the United Nations Law of the Sea.

The South Korean military conducted a "precision missile-firing drill" as a response to the launch, a South Korean military official told NBC.-1

The new Boeing MD-10 has been converted into a working hospital by charity Orbis International. It flies to developing countries to provide training for doctors and nurses, as well as delivering sight-saving surgeries.

The plane is made up of nine modular compartments.

There's the admin office, which has a hidden stairwell down into the converted cargo hold. No longer a place for luggage, it's now used by the plane's maintenance team.

Next it's the audio visual room that not only takes care of the on board Wi-Fi but monitors the many cameras inside the plane. These allow surgeries to be broadcast around the world, as well as streamed live to a 3-D TV for students sat in the classroom at the front of the plane.

Towards the back of the plane is the operating room kitted out with microscopes, scalpels and 3-D monitors. Right at the back of the plane is a large recovery room for patients.

The plane is also self-sustaining. They make their own hospital grade oxygen, burn their own jet fuel to power their equipment and have a water purifier that, according to Director of Aircraft Operations Bruce Johnson, is designed "to kill every bacteria known to man."0

Ocado describes the OSP as a "proprietary solution for operating online retail businesses." In an announcement Tuesday morning, the companies said that the scalable and modular end-to-end solution provided by the OSP offered a "unique answer to the opportunities and challenges posed by shifting offline/online trends in grocery."

Shares of Ocado spiked on the news, rising more than 26 percent as the session opened Tuesday.



The businesses said that the agreement set out plans for the "immediate initiation" of the development of a customer fulfilment center that would use Ocado's proprietary mechanical handling equipment.



The warehouse will serve the Paris area as well as the Normandie and Hauts de France regions. The build and launch of the fulfilment center is expected to last "at least" two years.



Jean-Charles Naouri, Groupe Casino's CEO, said the agreement represented a "major leap in terms of quality: 50,000 food items will be offered in the first stage to customers in the Greater Paris area with precise and speedy delivery at home and through a platform which makes it achievable to do this profitably."



Ocado CEO Tim Steiner said the business would continue to make investments to commercialize its proprietary platform and expected the Casino Groupe deal "to be one of many successful collaborations with leading retailers to use it the world over."

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/this-chart-shows-that-oil-could-be-headed-to-80-and-heres-how-to-trade-it.htmlThis chart shows that oil could be headed to $80, and here’s how to trade itCrude oil prices are under pressure, but Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com says the charts are pointing to a massive rally for the commodity.

Gordon is standing by his call that the market is starting to see signs of inflation. He also said the Federal Reserve won't significantly tighten monetary policy. A Fed tightening, in this case raising interest rates, would boost the dollar, which tends to trade inversely with oil.

Central bank policymakers meet Dec. 18-19, and analysts are nearly unanimous that the to Fed will nudge up interest rates, according to a CME Group survey.

"The Fed's not going to raise rates significantly over the next year," Gordon told CNBC in a telephone interview Wednesday.

The central bank is "not going to provide the boost that the dollar would need to continue to rally," he said on CNBC's "Trading Nation" on Tuesday. "So if the dollar continues to stay quiet to slightly weak, crude oil should continue to move on up."

But even from a technical standpoint, Gordon says a very promising inverse head and shoulders pattern has formed in the chart of crude, which he takes to be a bullish sign signaling a rally.

"Now we've come back and we've begun to break what we call the shoulder line, and we should begin to moving up, potentially reaching the $80 level," he said. "So what I'd like to do is just be long crude oil."

In other words, Gordon sees crude surging 38 percent from Tuesday's levels.

To play for a huge surge in crude, Gordon wants to trade the oil-tracking ETF USO. He is buying the March 16 weekly 11-strike call for about $1, meaning that he sees USO staying above the $11 level. This means that Gordon is risking $100 on the trade, and will make money so long as USO closes above $12 on March 16.

But in case USO starts dipping below $11, Gordon wants to establish a place to stop out of the trade.

"If the $1 premium we just outlaid gets cut in half down to about 50 cents, the trade isn't working," he said.

Crude oil is up almost 8 percent year to date.0
https://www.thedailybeast.com/strong-evidence-that-us-special-operations-forces-massacred-civilians-in-somaliaStrong Evidence that U.S. Special Operations Forces Massacred Civilians in SomaliaUpdated with Defense Department response appended, 1:30 p.m. EST, November 29, 2017.

MOGADISHU, Somalia — It was around five in the morning when Abdullahi Elmi heard the gunfire. Sitting in his small home in Bariire, in southern Somalia, the farm administrator had been recording the names of the laborers who had worked the day before. Stacks of accounting books sprawled on the floor around him. Across the room, his wife sat with their three-year-old son who dozed as his mother rocked him back and forth in her arms.

When the sound of gunshots began, Abdullahi thought they were too far away to be heading towards his farm. But within seconds they seemed to grow louder, and closer, sending Abdullahi and his wife, carrying their young son, sprinting through the nearby forest of banana trees in search of safety.

Sheltering beneath the long leaves, Abdullahi came across his neighbor, Goomey Hassan, who had also sprinted into the banana grove with his wife when he heard the barrage of gunfire. The two families waited for 20 minutes before they decided it was safe to return, and began walking cautiously back to their homes, both Abdullahi and Goomey careful to walk in front of their wives in case the gunfire returned.

As the women entered their houses, the two men stood outside to see what had happened, eventually spotting Somali National Army soldiers walking in the distance. At first Abdullahi was relieved, the national army must have come to stop their rival clan from attacking their farm, he thought. But as the soldiers saw the men, they raised their weapons, ordering Hassan and Elmi to get down on the ground.

“ Blood from a gunshot wound poured into the earth around him. ”

“I put my hands up and they told us you are under arrest, then I heard the noise from their big cars and I knew this was more than just a clan fight,” Elmi said. “They told my wife to go back in our home and then they went inside to search. I was pleading with them not to take anything.”

When the soldiers finished their search, they ordered the men to move with them towards the scene of the shooting. There Abdullahi and Goomey saw their fellow farmers’ bodies sprawled across the ground. The small pot that one of them had been using to make tea still stood upright near the corpses. And they also saw what they later estimated to be around 20 American soldiers standing around the bodies. A Somali National Army soldier who was at the scene estimated 10 to 12 Americans were there. Abdullahi felt his chest tighten as he heard his friend, Ali-waay, calling for help, blood from a gunshot wound pouring into the earth around him.

One of the Somali soldiers ordered Abdullahi to put his head on the ground. The bottom of a boot belonging to an American soldier kept it there.

THE U.S.-LED OPERATION on Aug. 25 would result in the death of 10 civilians, including at least one child, and become the largest stain on U.S. ground operations in the country since the infamous Black Hawk Down incident in 1993.

In the operation’s aftermath, hundreds of people in the nearby town Afgoye flooded the city’s streets demanding justice for those killed, and survivors on the farm refused to bury their dead until the Somali government recanted its allegations that they were members Al Shabaab, and offered an apology.

The Daily Beast conducted an investigation into the Bariire operation and its aftermath, interviewing three of the operation’s survivors over the phone from Mogadishu and meeting in person with the Somali National Army Commander in charge of the Somali soldiers who assisted in the operation under the command of soldiers from U.S. Special Operations Forces.

The Daily Beast also met in Mogadishu with over two dozen Somali intelligence officers, political analysts, local leaders, and former and current government officials familiar with the incident. Two of these individuals are also involved in an ongoing local, non-government-sponsored investigation into the incident.

The Daily Beast also met in person with the commander of the Ugandan People’s Defense Forces whose purview under the mandate of the United Nations peacekeeping force includes Bariire, and who was approached by the Americans about their plan to re-capture and hold Bariire.

The vast majority of these sources preferred to speak anonymously, either because they were not authorized to discuss the incident or because they feared possible retribution from either the Somali Federal Government or the Americans for doing so.

The details that emerged paint a damning picture of at least one U.S. ground operation in the African nation. This includes U.S. Special Operators firing upon unarmed civilians, using human intelligence from sources widely considered untrustworthy to Somalis in the region as well as government officials, and instructing their Somali counterparts to collect weapons that were being stored inside a home—not displaced on the field in the course of the firefight—and placing them beside the bodies of those killed prior to photographing them. In the aftermath of the incident, according to our sources, American diplomats also pressured the Somali government to bury the unfavorable findings of a Somali Federal Government-led investigation.

Hours after the operation, AFRICOM released a statement noting that it was aware of allegations of civilian casualties in the operation and that AFRICOM was “conducting an assessment into the situation to determine the facts on the ground.” The AFRICOM press release also stated that “the Somali National Army was conducting an operation in the area with U.S. forces in a supporting role.”

Yet a majority of bullet casings collected from the farm that was attacked, which were seen by The Daily Beast, were from American—not Somali National Army—weapons. This appears to confirm that the Special Operations team did not command SNA while remaining behind during the operation, as the AFRICOM statement would have the public believe, but rather were responsible themselves for firing upon and killing unarmed civilians.

According to Maj. Audricia Harris, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, “this incident remains under investigation” and the DOD cannot comment on any specifics of the employment of U.S. Special Operations forces. She noted that U.S. Special Operations “take all measures during the targeting process to avoid or minimize civilian casualties or collateral damage and to comply with the principles of the Law of Armed Conflict.” (The complete list of queries and responses can be viewed here‍ .)

The details surrounding the planning of this incident collected by The Daily Beast suggest, however, that the Special Operations Forces involved in this mission did not sufficiently vet the information they were presented with prior to carrying out this operation.

LOWER SHABELLE has long been a hotspot in Somalia’s decades of conflict, with Bariire town at its heart. The area is one of the most fertile regions in the otherwise barren Somali landscape: here farmers cultivate green fields of bananas, mangos, and tomatoes running parallel to the Shabelle River while businessmen sell the produce in the nearby capital Mogadishu.

But the same lushness that makes the region attractive to farmers has also made it desirable real estate for Al Shabaab: the plentiful crops are ripe for taxation, the vegetation is good for taking cover from drone surveillance, and the Shebelle River creates a natural barrier between Al Shabaab and enemy forces, while its bridges create opportunities for Al Shabaab’s hit and run attacks.

The Islamic extremist group has held sporadic control throughout the region since January 2009, when the Ethiopian forces that had helped oust the Islamic Courts Union, a confederation of Sharia courts that rose to power in southern Somalia in 2006, withdrew from the region. Though in the years following the African Union Peacekeeping Mission in Somalia or AMISOM retook some large towns and established Forward Operating Bases throughout Lower Shabelle, the area remains one of the last large swaths of territory where Al Shabaab maintains pockets of control.

For years the heart of Al Shabab’s dominance in the area of Lower Shabelle near Mogadishu could be found in Bariire town, located just 45 kilometers from the capital. From this town the group ran courts they used to implement Sharia law in the region and organized attacks carried out in Mogadishu. According to Minister of Parliament Ahmed Moalim Fiqi, the town had acted as Al Shabaab’s “small capital” near Mogadishu. “[Bariire] had become a nightmare for the Somali government and created problems for Somalia’s security partners,” Fiqi says. “Every security report [Somali Parliament’s Security Committee] received, Bariire was included.”

“ The Americans appeared woefully unaware that in this vast and forest-rich region, Al Shabaab isn’t the only factor contributing to instability. ”

And the Somali Parliament wasn’t the only one taking note of Bariire. U.S. Special Operators recognized the town’s strategic significance as well, which is why in July this year they approached the Ugandan People’s Defense Force or UPDF Brig. Gen. Kayanja Muhanga, whose responsibilities under AMISOM include Lower Shabelle, about a plan they had developed to retake Bariire town and the surrounding region. Unlike U.S. operations in years past, this campaign wouldn’t consist of targeted airstrikes or raids, both of which have seen relative success in Somalia. Instead, the U.S. wanted to hold the land they would capture and provide intermittent on-the-ground support with the local force in charge of maintaining control of the territory.

According to Brig. Gen. Muhanga, the Americans were requesting the Department of State sponsored equipment for building Forward Operating Bases or FOBs, such as caterpillars and graders, from a nearby AMISOM FOB, as well as UPDF troops to be retasked with the Somali National Army to hold the terrain in Bariire and beyond. The UPDF general was skeptical of this plan. His troops were already overstretched across the region; not only would they not be able to provide adequate security for the FOB building equipment, but he questioned whether he could lend enough troops to hold a new FOB with the Somali National Army, which he knew to be under-trained, under-equipped, and likely unable to hold any outposts themselves.

And in addition to foolhardy planning of the hold-terrain operation, the Americans also appeared to be woefully unaware that in this vast and forest-rich region, Al Shabaab isn’t the only factor contributing to instability. Further complicating the security landscape is the ongoing conflict among Somali clans, primarily the Habar Gidr and Biyomal. The rivalry between them, like most clan conflict in the country, revolves around land and, with the emergence of a functioning Somali state, power.

Though clan alliances and clan conflicts span centuries, the current flare up in Lower Shabelle dates back five years when Biyomal and Habar Gidr renewed their fight over the majority Habar- Gidr-controlled land. The Biyomal, a smaller clan which have traditionally lived in Lower Shabelle, claim the land is rightfully theirs given their historic presence in the region, while the Habar Gidr began to migrate south to the fertile Lower Shabelle in the 1990s when civil war broke out and their clan won authority in the region. They maintain that having lived on the land for decades they can legitimately call it their own.

But unlike centuries past, clan conflicts in modern Somalia have been complicated first by Al Shabaab and later by the presence of AMISOM, American Special Operations, and other foreign militaries operating in the country.

Since Al Shabaab formed in 2007, the group has thrived on local conflicts, offering support to the militias in their clan wars in exchange for their firepower when Al Shabaab confronts government forces. But farmers in the region, who aren’t part of these militias, though they are often armed to protect their land and livestock, aren’t as lucky. When their territory is taken over by Al Shabaab, they don’t have a choice: either agree to pay taxes to the group and to live under their authority or risk disarmament and death.

This modus operandi creates a military landscape ripe for confusion, where distinguishing Al Shabaab militants from armed farmers in Al Shabaab controlled territories requires accurate, unbiased, on-the-ground intelligence.

Yet because foreign militaries, including U.S. Special Operations, often rely either on clan militias, or the Somali security forces which have incorporated some of these militias into their ranks, for human intelligence, there is ample opportunity for clansmen to label their rivals falsely as “Al Shabaab,” and garner the support of foreign forces, and their much more sophisticated weaponry, in their own clan wars.

When the UPDF commander, cognizant of the difficulties of terrain and this kind of operation, turned down the American’s request for UPDF support and advised against the mission, the Americans turned instead to the Somali National Army’s 20th Brigade, a poor semblance of a military at best.

“ These American guys are our friends, but they came in rushing into operations without understanding the SNA capability. ” — UPDF Brig. Gen. Kayanja Muhanga

“I told the U.S. guys the SNA can’t hold ground, they don’t have the weapons to hold ground,” Gen. Muhanga said. “These American guys are our friends, but they came in rushing into operations without understanding the SNA capability because they wanted to achieve something themselves.”

Unlike the SNA’s special forces unit, Danab, which has been trained by the Americans to operate alongside them in ground operations, the SNA brigade this U.S. team approached had not only never been trained by any U.S. Special Operators but also was led by a former Al Shabaab commander, Sheegow Ahmed Ali, who had worked closely with the Biyomal militia in the region, led by Abdullahi Ali Ahmed also known as “Wafo,” in the lead-up to this operation.

The Americans seemingly worked with them ignorant of both the clan dynamics pitting Wafo’s militia against Habargidir clansmen like those on the farm and of a complaint, obtained by The Daily Beast, made by the Lower Shabelle Community Elders committee to the regional president, the minister of interior, the United Nations mission, the U.S. Embassy, the E.U. Delegation and the African Union representative last year about Wafo’s Biyomal militia attacking civilians and using AMISOM protection to do so. The letter stated that “AMISOM is sheltering and providing logistical support to Biyomal militia forces….while Biyomal Militia is burning farms, looting properties and killing innocent civilians without discrimination (elders, children, women and youth) under the AMISOM protection in their barracks.”

The Daily Beast also learned from multiple Somali government and security officials, that the Americans were using a translator who had a history of suspected manipulation of U.S. Forces.

The translator, known as Bashir, had been involved in a 2016 operation in Galkayo, northern Somalia, in which a U.S. drone strike targeted and killed 22 members of a local militia which had been working in collaboration with U.S. forces, according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism. After the incident, many believed Bashir was complicit in providing inaccurate intelligence to the American forces because the local force was from a rival clan to his own. Given that his wife is from the Biyomal clan, many suspect Bashir had helped persuade the Americans that the Habar Gidr on the farm were Al Shabab as well, though the reason the U.S. would use a translator suspected previously of manipulating them into killing non-Al Shabaab combatants is unclear.

“We don’t believe the Americans have any agenda to kill us, they don’t have an agenda to support one clan against another,” says Ali Osman Diblawe, one of the farmers who was attacked in the operation. “But the Biyomal clan used misinformation and propaganda to wrongly kill us. They persuaded the Somali government and the Americans that we are Al Shabaab, which we are not.”

DIBLAWE’S FARM is located on one of Lower Shabelle’s fault lines where government soldiers and Al Shabab militants meet.

Six days before the operation on his farm, the fighting had come so close to his village that he and other farmers fled, returning to their homes a day later when the smoke had settled and Al Shabaab militants vacated the area.

The fighting he and other villagers heard was in Bariire town, where even without the UPDF support, the American Special Operations team had begun their campaign to retake and hold first Bariire and then the surrounding area, according to UPDF Gen. Muhanga. At first, the strategy appeared to be working: the U.S. and SNA team successfully retook Bariire and set up four outposts on each corner of the city in order to hold it against Al Shabaab as planned.

With their farm just one kilometer away from Bariire town, now seemingly under government control, Diblawe decided to meet with the SNA in Bariire and explain the ongoing clan conflict in the nearly liberated area. Diblawe and some of his fellow villagers owned small arms, mostly old AK-47s, to protect their land against the Biyomal, which he feared the SNA might misinterpret as the farmers being fighters for Al Shabaab.

Diblawe walked with a friend and fellow villager, Ali-waay, to Bariire town where he met with Gen. Sheegow. A rotund man who stands roughly five foot five inches tall, Sheegow didn’t give Diblawe the impression of a feared military commander.

But a glimpse into the 56-year-old’s life before he joined the Somali National Army proves otherwise. Prior to 2012, Sheegow was an Al Shabaab commander who defected to government forces with between 50 and 100 of his fighters. But most suspect it was a defection born from the fear of being imminently captured by Somali government troops than a change of heart. The first battle his brigade fought with Al Shabaab under the SNA flag, they lost—along with a number of arms and military cars that fell into Al Shabaab’s hands. The incident raised questions about whether the general had lost on purpose in an effort to continue supporting the extremist group.

The Daily Beast met Sheegow in Mogadishu, where three government officials say he was to be reprimanded for the emerging pattern of civilian casualties under his leadership in the part of Lower Shabelle, for which his brigade is responsible. Sheegow denied those claims.

According to Diblawe, during his meeting with General Sheegow he explained that the Biyomal and the Habar Gidr had been fighting over land in the area Sheegow was now responsible for and suggested the general either disarm both groups or reconcile the two clans.

“He told us he would reconcile us with the Biyomal and that there wasn’t anything to worry about,” Diblawe says. Upon returning to his village, he told the villagers about his agreement with Sheegow and instructed them to place all of their small arms in one of the village’s corrugated tin homes, per the instructions of Gen. Sheegow.

In an interview with The Daily Beast, Sheegow denied having met with Diblawe prior to the operation, although immediately after the incident he told local media that he had “talked with the farmers in the area and instructed them to put their weapons in their homes to avoid confusion” about who was and wasn’t Al Shabab.

Waiting for the next steps in the reconciliation process, Diblawe and other villagers returned to their fields, hoping to hear word from Sheegow about when the reconciliation efforts would begin. But days later Diblawe and others in the village noticed something strange looming over their farms with a noise that pierced the sky around them. Staring at the sky from outside his home, Diblawe though it looked like a strange crow circling the village. But the loud hum that pierced the otherwise peaceful landscape suggested otherwise. Diblawe knew this wasn’t a bird. It was a drone.

“ Sheegow was an Al Shabaab commander who defected to government forces with between 50 and 100 of his fighters. ”

“It was coming in the morning, around five or six in the morning and again around five in the evening,” Diblawe said. “It was clear the Americans with Sheegow were interested in us, that’s why they were using their spy drone above us.”

Diblawe returned to the general, begging Sheegow to let him speak directly with the Americans so he could clarify who the villagers were. Diblawe suggested the foreign force search their farm so they could see the small arms and Diblawe could explain why the villagers were in possession of them. Again, Sheegow told him to be patient and that the reconciliation process would begin soon. Diblawe returned to his village wary of the general, and feeling disheartened knowing that without the general’s support, he had no chance of trying to communicate with the Americans directly.

The next day villagers spotted the drone hovering overhead again. Diblawe’s concerns grew. He returned to Sheegow for the third time, pleading to speak with the Americans. Again, Sheegow denied him.

That would be Diblawe’s last plea for help. The next morning gunfire tore through his small village and Diblawe’s concerns that the farmers had been mistaken for Al Shabab were proven true.

AFTER GATHERING with roughly 20 other villagers to say the morning prayer on Friday, Diblawe had crawled back into his bed hoping to rest a bit more before starting his day. Less than 10 minutes later he heard the sound of gunfire and sprinted out of his bed to his doorstep, from which he saw his neighbor, Ali-waay, standing with his hands up and uniformed men in the distance. Diblawe immediately started running toward the forest behind his house.

“I was barefoot and there were a lot of bullets hitting near me but I didn’t stop for one second, I ran and started heading in the direction of Bariire town, I thought the military there could stop the firing,” he said.

Arriving in Bariire, Diblawe first saw an SNA lieutenant, Mohamed Mohamud Abor, and ran up to him, demanding to see Sheegow. The lieutenant brought the winded farmer to Sheegow’s outpost, where looking the general in the eye Diblawe was overcome by a sense of both despair and bewilderment. “I asked him why all of this is happening, we just left him here yesterday and told him our concerns, and now the people were being killed,” Diblawe said. “I told him let us rescue the people who are still alive, let us see if we can save these people.”

Meanwhile on the other side of the farm from Diblawe’s house, Abdullahi and Goomey were being escorted to the center of the village by Somali National Army soldiers. Told to lie down on the ground, the two men could hardly believe the carnage around them. Ten of their friends were sprawled across the ground. Some like Ali-waay —the same man who gone to town with Diblawe the day before— were barely alive and calling weakly for help. The soldiers around them were not listening.

Roughly thirty minutes earlier, Goomey had been praying with most of them, and saw the teapot they had begun to brew still sitting on the ground, the body of a pre-teen boy in a brown t-shirt and dark blue jeans stretched out beside it. He knew the others would have been waiting for the tea when the barrage of gunfire began. The Daily Beast has photographs of the villagers taken after the attack, although many are too graphic for publication. They show the teapot, a black water heater, and a large pot scattered around the boy’s body.

Near the boy, Goomey saw his friend, Dangaweyne, who had traveled with him from the nearby town Afgoye to their small village the day before. A few meters away was another wounded man, Abdullahi Abdullahi, weakly shouting “save me, save me!” in the direction of Goomey and Abdullahi Elmi. Just beyond was Ali-waay, his chest bleeding, begging the men to help him and another man, asking if someone could move his leg which had been contorted after he fell to the ground from a gunshot wound.

“ The body of a pre-teen boy in a brown t-shirt and dark blue jeans stretched out beside the pot where he had boiled tea. ”

Abdullahi asked the Somali soldiers if he could help the men. The Somali soldier looked at Abdullahi for a moment and agreed. But as he started to stand up, an American soldier stopped him. “The American guy got angry and directed me to lie down, so I lay down with my chest on the ground and he put his boot on me to keep me there,” Abdullahi said. With his head tilted to his side, Abdullahi could see the Somali soldiers entering the house where the farmers had kept their old AK-47s.

Carrying the weapons out of the home, the Somali soldiers then placed them beside the bodies of the other villagers. He and Goomey also saw three of the American men, who Goomey describes as one tall man with two shorter men next to him, taking pictures of the bodies with the weapons placed beside them. One of the men was taking a picture with with a small black camera that gave off a flash with each photo taken, while the other two were taking photos on their phones, Goomey says. A Somali National Army soldier who arrived later at the scene estimated there were between 10 and 13 U.S. Special Operators in the village who, he said, were Navy SEALS.

As they were taking photos, Abdullahi saw the Americans point the Somali soldiers to a small house. They entered the makeshift shanty and emerged with a roughly 50-year-old man known as Hassan “Dooro,” whose second name means “chicken” in Somali, because he is a chicken farmer. Abdullahi later learned from Hassan, that the Somali soldiers found him lying under his bed where he had hidden once he heard the sound of gunfire.

Back in Bariire, Sheegow had agreed to give Diblawe a vehicle of SNA soldiers to take him to the farm. Sheegow first said he was informing the Americans in Bariire so they could warn their counterparts at the farm, and after around 15 minutes Diblawe headed back in the direction of his village. When they arrived at the scene, Diblawe could hardly believe what he saw and looking at the American soldiers he was amazed by how well equipped they were. While the SNA soldiers were carrying AK-47s, the Americans had machine guns and three well equipped armoured vehicles. A Somali National Army soldier in Bariire later described the American’s weapons as looking like a more modern and smaller version of an M16 which were outfitted with scopes and were extendable at the back. Goomey also noticed the cars, which he describes as the “color of tea when you add milk to it.”

Once Diblawe arrived, the Somali soldiers who came with him also looked with horror at the scene, some of them saying they knew these men and knew they were civilians. “The Somalis who came later were crying as they were looking at these people, one of them was asking why they killed these people and that he knew Ali-waay, why was he shot,” Abdullahi says. A few minutes later the soldier who had told Abdullahi and Goomey to get on the ground, said they were released and got back into their car. With that the Somali and American team packed into their vehicles and left the scene, the message that these were civilians having finally been relayed to them. With the help of the Somali soldiers who arrived with Diblawe and stayed at the scene, they began collecting the bodies of the dead, still in shock from what had just transpired.

When Abdullahi finally went back to his small home, he saw that the money on his shelf was gone. The soldiers had taken everything.

IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH of the attack, the Somali Ministry of Information first announced that Somali soldiers had killed eight Al Shabab fighters in a raid on a farming village near Bariire town and that “no civilians were harmed or killed in this operation.” But as the details of the operation reached Mogadishu, and elders from the Habargidir community as well as local administrators began speaking with local media about the farmers who were attacked, Somali officials started offering conflicting accounts of who the farmers were. The Somali President, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, even published a tweet offering condolences to the families of those killed in Bariire which was removed minutes later. And as that news spread, so too did the public anger at the Somali federal government and their American counterparts.

Diblawe and the other farmers refused to bury their dead until the Somali government officially recanted their allegations that the farmers were Al Shabaab militants, bringing the bodies to Mogadishu to be kept in a refrigerated truck and shown to the Somali officials they believed green-lit the operation.

By the time the bodies arrived in Mogadishu, which would have been an unprecedented act for Al Shabaab militants, dozens of family members and elders had spoken out in defense of the farmers and hardly anyone in the city still believed they were extremists. Within days, even the Chief of Defense Forces and Minister of Information admitted that it had been civilians killed in the operation.

With the outpouring of public anger, the Somalia federal government opened an investigation into the incident, in the course of which government officials approached Diblawe and others to collect information on who they were, why they had weapons, and what happened during the attack. But to much of the public’s surprise, the federal government never made the outcome of that investigation public nor did the Somali president ever officially admit that civilians had been wrongly targeted during the ground operation.

According to one government official and one former security official, the outcome of that investigation not only confirmed that the farmers were civilians but was buried under pressure from the United States government. According to these sources the U.S. first tried to pressure Somali officials to deny the allegations that the farmers were civilians publicly but knowing the political cost of doing so, the President of Somalia refused. Instead to appease the families of the victims, the Somali government then paid them between $60,000 and $70,000 each, according to both of these sources, one of whom strongly believes was in fact paid for by the American government.

“ The farmers refused to bury their dead. They brought the bodies to Mogadishu. ”

With little public acknowledgment of wrongdoing from the national government, a former official then began an independent investigation into the operation, in the course of which he collected the shell casings from the area in the days after the attack.

The Daily Beast saw photos of the shells taken at the scene as well as five individual shell casings in person in Mogadishu.

According to multiple weapons experts consulted by the Daily Beast, the casings are a mix of both 7.62x39 mm rounds, mostly likely from AK-47s such as those used by the SNA, and 5.56x45 mm NATO rounds on M27 disintegrating belt links. The 5.56x45mm rounds are used by M249 Squad Automatic Weapons or their lighter versions, the Mark 46 or Mark 48 machine guns, which are known to be used by U.S. Special Operators. These links are also stamped “ALK,” which indicates manufacture at the Lake City Ammunition Plant, a U.S. government owned facility in Independence, Missouri which manufactures and tests small caliber ammunition for the U.S. military.

The Somalia National Army is not in possession of any weapons that would fire such rounds. According to a former high-ranking intelligence official who is now a senior security advisor to the Somali Federal Government, the Somali National Army only carry AK-47s, PKMs, and some DSHk machine guns mounted on the back of pickup trucks due to the longstanding arms embargo the U.N. Security Council imposed in January 1992.

Additionally Diblawe, Goomey, and Abdullahi, all eye witnesses of the attack’s aftermath, noted that the Somali National Army soldiers present were carrying AK-47s which do not incorporate the type of machine gun belt link which composed the majority of those casings collected on the farm, while the American soldiers were carrying what they described as machine guns.

This evidence strongly suggests that the American team themselves fired upon the farmers and that soldiers serving under the U.S. Special Operations Command can be held directly responsible for the deaths of these unarmed civilians.

ON SEPTEMBER 29th, roughly one month after this operation, the four outposts the Americans had established with the SNA around Bariire town were overrun by Al Shabaab forces. According to the UPDF commander, the Americans and Somalis had set up three outposts on each corner of the city, two on the north side of the town with Danab, which had been posted to Bariire after the farm incident, and SNA forces and one on the south side across the Shabelle River with Gen. Sheegow’s SNA forces, with a bridge crossing over the river connecting them. Early that morning, Al Shabaab detonated two vehicle born IEDs or VBIEDs in Bariire, the first of which destroyed the bridge connecting Sheegow’s outpost to the two others on the other side of the river.

After the bridge was destroyed, another VBIED hit the Danab base and Al Shabab fighters began to assault both the Danab and SNA northern outposts. By the end of the two hour long siege, at least 40 soldiers were dead, according to a member of the SNA, and at least 10 of their vehicles and much of their equipment had been seized by Al Shabaab.

“The Americans came with that over-confidence that they could hold Bariire, but even if you have better weapons, you have to know the terrain,” says Gen. Muhanga, who also noted the Americans had visited the outposts the day before they were overrun, but left to return to Mogadishu. “I warned them those outposts would be overrun, I warned them that those boys would be killed.”

The loss of Bariire town signaled the end of the failed U.S. military campaign to retake and hold the area from Al Shabaab. Today, the town is under the control of Al Shabaab—and Diblawe, Abdullahi and Goomey, who have lost ten of their friends, are once again subject to Al Shabaab's extremist rule.

UPDATE, 1:30 P.M. EST, November 29, 2017:

In an apparent rush to preempt The Daily Beast's investigation of the Bariire incident, published earlier today, AFRICOM announced this afternoon that it had concluded its investigation. It offers no evidence whatsoever to corroborate its findings. This is the full text:

Aug. 25 civilian casualty allegation assessment results released

After a thorough assessment of the Somali National Army-led operation near Bariire, Somalia, on Aug. 25, 2017 and the associated allegations of civilian casualties, U.S. Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAF) has concluded that the only casualties were those of armed enemy combatants.

After a thorough assessment of the Somali National Army-led operation near Bariire, Somalia, on Aug. 25, 2017 and the associated allegations of civilian casualties, U.S. Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAF) has concluded that the only casualties were those of armed enemy combatants.

Before conducting operations with partner forces, SOCAF conducts detailed planning and coordination to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties and to ensure compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict. U.S. Africa Command and the Department of Defense take allegations of civilian casualties very seriously.

For details on the Aug. 25 operation, visit: http://www.africom.mil/media-room/pressrelease/29846/civilian-casualty-allegations-in-somalia

That link leads to the initial statement about the operation in August, which provides no details whatsoever:

Civilian casualty allegations in Somalia

We are aware of the civilian casualty allegations near Bariire, Somalia. We take any allegations of civilian casualties seriously, and per standard, we are conducting an assessment into the situation to determine the facts on the ground.

The Notorious Islamophobe Whose Warnings About Islam Donald Trump RetweetedJayda Fransen was a notorious Islamophobe long before Donald Trump retweeted her warnings about Islam. The 31-year-old was convicted of religiously aggravated assault for shouting at a woman in a hijab last year. She told the woman Muslims cannot control their sexual urges, saying: “That’s why they are coming into my country raping women across the continent”. Fransen has also advocated shooting Muslims and called for her opponents to be hanged. On Wednesday, Trump retweeted her three inflammatory, unverified videos she posted to stir up hatred of Muslims, a common tactic of the far right, anti-Islam Britain First, of which Fransen is deputy leader.

The videos Trump retweeted are all in keeping with Britain First’s repeated claims Britain First, a fringe group built around publicity stunts and social media, says that Islam is an irredeemable threat to Europe.

Trump’s action stunned Britain, with one MP calling Britain First “a fascist, racist, extremist hate group”. For six years, the group has fought and failed to get this kind of publicity, as electoral success eluded it. When Sadiq Khan became the first Muslim elected mayor of a major Western city last year, the Britain First candidate turned his back in protest. Paul Golding, who is also the party’s leader, said he was protesting Islamic extremism.

It has carried out so-called “Christian Patrols” in areas with large Muslim populations, during which its members have scuffled with locals, often while repeating the myth that British cities have “no go zones”. It has repeatedly held protests outside mosques and called Allah a “false prophet”. Its founder Jim Dowson, a fundamentalist Christian, quit the party in 2014, saying its confrontations with Muslims were “counter-productive”. Britain First claims to be defenders of “traditional British Christian values” and Golding has regularly invoked religious rhetoric to justify its actions.

It is often more akin to a militia than a party. Members have been pictured holding wooden “training” knives and wearing combat fatigues in the woods. When Thomas Mair shot and stabbed MP Jo Cox to death, witnesses said the far right terrorist shouted “Britain first!”. The party said he was “categorically not a member” and denied any link. The party is bigger on social media than at the ballot box It has never come close to winning any elections (Golding polled just 1.2% when he stood for London mayor) but tries a build its following on sites like Facebook. There, it publishes videos showing its leadership travelling to confront Muslims in public places and clips, like those Trump retweeted, that it claims show Muslims being violent. In August, Fransen tweeted a video she said showed “migrants in Spain attacking tourists and locals”. It actually showed UK rapper, MoStack, defending himself with a broom as someone tried to attack him with a knife.

Its Facebook page has close to two million likes, more than any other UK party. Fransen’s personal page has 210,000. But campaigners Hope Not Hate estimated Britain First has just 1,000 members. Paul Golding’s attempts at notoriety Both Golding and Fransen have were both banned from entering Luton, a town outside London where they have often demonstrated. Golding was released from jail in January, having broken a court order not to enter a mosque, and made a video saying his time behind bars made him “more bitter”. In the alarming clip, he predicted a “day of reckoning” and threatened “journalists and politicians” who have committed “crimes against our nation”. He said: “I can promise you, from the very depths of my being, you will all meet your miserable ends at the hands of the Britain First movement. Every last one of you.” Inside Jayda Fransen’s Self Promotion Machine Fransen, who was party leader during Golding’s stint in prison, was ecstatic to receive Trump’s attention, tweeting in block capitals: “GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP! GOD BLESS AMERICA!”

Fransen often styles herself a crusading heroine, signing off social media posts “OCS” - Onward Christian Soldiers - and calling herself a “soldier of Christ”. She often protests outside mosques holding a white cross.

On the London campaign trail, Fransen admonished the party’s “pro-EU, Islamist-loving opponents” for “ruining our country”, saying: “We will not rest until every traitor is punished for their crimes against our country. “And by punished, I mean good old fashioned British justice at the end of a rope!” Her and the party’s social media channels churn out “Jayda’s Soapbox”, a series of videos where Fransen repeats far right shibboleths about immigration and the treacherous left. A week after her November 2016 conviction for harassing a Muslim woman, she put out a video saying: “If the presence of armed police is required to protect an innocent Christian family against Muslims in Britain, then they should be permitted to turn their guns on those Muslims.” Fransen was charged over a speech she gave in Belfast and is due in court again on December 14. She and Golding are also being prosecuted for religiously aggravated harassment over leaflets and videos they distributed during a rape trial of four Muslim men.-1

(CNN) For the first time since 1999, there are no white male solo artists nominated for a best album Grammy and people have definite feelings about that.

This year's nominees for album of the year are Jay-Z's "4:44," "Awaken, My Love!" by Childish Gambino, "DAMN" by Kendrick Lamar, "Melodrama" by Lorde and "24K Magic" by Bruno Mars.

In 1999, the nominees for that category included four female artists: "The Globe Sessions" by Sheryl Crow, "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" by Lauryn Hill, "Ray of Light" by Madonna, "Come on Over" by Shania Twain and "Version 2.0" by the band Garbage whose lead singer was the woman, Shirley Manson.

He said he wasn't expecting the sadness of his latest role

(CNN) Daniel Day-Lewis is known for immersing himself in his roles, but this time around it may have ended his acting career.

The esteemed actor recently talked to W magazine about his role as couturier Reynolds Woodcock in the forthcoming film "Phantom Thread," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.

Day-Lewis got so into character that he learned to sew -- apprenticing for months under the head of the costume department at the New York City Ballet -- and even recreated a Balenciaga sheath dress using his wife, filmmaker Rebecca Miller, as his model.

But the 60 year-old actor said diving into the life of Woodcock and all the drama it entailed also sunk him into a depression.

"Before making the film, I didn't know I was going to stop acting," he said. "I do know that Paul and I laughed a lot before we made the movie. And then we stopped laughing because we were both overwhelmed by a sense of sadness."

Brooks said in a radio interview the yearbook inscription was forged and that the accusations against Moore were political attacks that would not lead to a jury conviction in a court.

(CNN) Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said Tuesday that a woman who accused Republican nominee for US Senate Roy Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 is "clearly a liar."

The woman, Beverly Young Nelson, now 56, showed reporters at a news conference earlier this month what she said was Moore's inscription in her yearbook in 1977, which read, "To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.' Love, Roy Moore DA, 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House." Moore has denied writing the inscription and his lawyer Philip L. Jauregui demanded earlier this month that Nelson and her lawyer, Gloria Allred, hand over the yearbook to be examined by a third party. Allred said Tuesday that they'd only do so if the Senate holds a hearing on Moore and the former Alabama Chief Justice testifies.

Brooks, who said Tuesday that he voted for Moore in the Alabama Senate race, said in a radio interview the yearbook inscription was forged and that the accusations against Moore were political attacks that would not lead to a jury conviction in a court.

"What you have is the mainstream leftwing socialist Democrat news media trying to distort the evidence to cause people to reach the conclusion that Roy Moore engaged in unlawful conduct with a minor and my analysis of the evidence is that is not the case," Brooks said on "The Dale Jackson Show" on WVNN Alabama radio. "Most importantly, the media likes to say 'well, there are nine complainers.' Seven of them aren't complainers. In fact, I would be calling seven of those ladies as witnesses on behalf of Roy Moore on the issue of whether he is engaged in any kind of unlawful conduct."

He continued, "There are only two that have asserted that Roy Moore engaged in unlawful conduct. One of those is clearly a liar because that one forged the 'love, Roy Moore' part of a yearbook in order to try to for whatever reason get at Roy Moore and win this seat for the Democrats and there's a lot more to it as to why I believe that the evidence is almost incontrovertible about whether the yearbook was forged."

http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/president-donald-trump-competency/index.htmlTrump's behavior raises questions of competencyWashington (CNN) Donald Trump potentially has millions of lives in his hands as the threat of a devastating war with North Korea swiftly escalates.

Yet the President of the United States is raising new questions about his temperament, his judgment and his understanding of the resonance of his global voice and the gravity of his role with a wild sequence of insults, inflammatory tweets and bizarre comments.

On Wednesday Trump caused outrage and sparked fears of violent reprisals against Americans and US interests overseas by retweeting graphic anti-Muslim videos by an extreme far right British hate group. Earlier this week he used a racial slur in front of Native American war heroes . He's attacked global press freedom, after cozying up to autocrats on his recent Asia tour.

And now there are reports that the President has revived conspiracy theories about former President Barack Obama's birthplace and is suggesting an "Access Hollywood" video on which he was heard boasting sexually assaulting women, and for which he apologized last year, had been doctored.

In normal times, it would be a concern that the President is conducting himself in a manner so at odds with the decorum and propriety associated for over two centuries with the office he holds.

If diplomacy is unable to defuse the North Korea crisis, or slow its march to the moment when Kim Jong Un can credibly claim to be able to target all of the United States with a nuclear payload, Trump will face one of the most intricate dilemmas of any modern President. Will he live with the threat posed by a mercurial, wildly unpredictable adversary? Or, will he launch what could turn out to be a hugely bloody and destructive war to remove Kim's nuclear threat?

There will be a premium on Trump's judgment, his capacity to absorb the most serious detail and to make choices that could put many, many lives at risk, and draw the United States into escalating situations in Northeast Asia.

Alternative truths

JUST WATCHED Trump retweets anti-Muslim content Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump retweets anti-Muslim content 01:03

For years, Trump, living his life in the glare of the New York tabloids took refuge in convenient alternative truths, constructed his own version of reality and actively promoted conspiracy theories. He maintained that model of behavior as a candidate and a President. But the fact such conduct is coinciding with what could evolve into a major global crisis will force his staff, fellow world leaders, the media and the public to grapple with the implications.

That's the context in which Trump's recent behavior is coloring and is the reason why this moment could turn about to be more significant than the unorthodox and unconventional months of his presidency up to now.

It's also why its fair to ask questions about his state of mind when, for instance, retweeting explosive videos of doubtful authenticity featured by the far right nationalist group Britain First, as he did on Tuesday.

"I have no idea what would motivate him to do that," former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on CNN's "New Day" on Tuesday. "To me, it's bizarre and disturbing, particularly when I think of him doing that in the context of North Korea, where moderation, and temperance and thought I think is critical."

Conversations about Trump's fitness and mental state have percolated in Washington for months. They have been fanned by the comments of GOP Sen. Bob Corker who warned the President could spark World War III.

Republican Sen. Jeff Flake last month fired off an explosive Senate speech in which he said that no one should stay silent, "as the norms and values that keep America strong are undermined and as the alliances and agreements that ensure the stability of the entire world are routinely threatened by the level of thought that goes into 140 characters."

On Wednesday, Flake said he was "flummoxed" at Trump's latest behavior after reading his latest Tweets.

"It's very inappropriate. Why? What does that get us? I'm having a hard time understanding it," Flake said, adding that he would start a series of Senate speeches on Trump's disregard for the truth.

In some ways, Trump's latest wild behavior turn gives Republicans yet another problem.

GOP senators will shortly vote on a tax reform bill that if it passes will give Trump a long awaited victory.

But that win will also bolster his prestige and power as President, leaving some to question whether the likes of Flake and Corker are putting principled objections to Trump's leadership aside for their own political reasons.

Crushing convention

JUST WATCHED A history of Donald Trump's 'birther' claims Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A history of Donald Trump's 'birther' claims 02:31

Trump has always crushed convention and been ready to step on racial, cultural and behavioral taboos, evidenced in his response for instance to Charlottesville riots and willingness to exploit foreign terror attacks to push his immigration policies. In many ways his spurning of political correctness has been key to his appeal. But some close observers of the President say they believe he has become even more unmoored in recent weeks.

"Something is unleashed with him lately," said New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who wrote about Trump's return to Birther conspiracy theories in on Wednesday morning.

"I don't know what is causing it, I don't know how to describe it," said Haberman, who is also a CNN contributor.

Trump's supporters often counter that the media is overreacting to his tweets and a style of conduct that often appears designed to cause outrage and offense -- or to distract attention from other political controversies.

They point to the roaring stock market, prospering economy and the dismembering of ISIS in Syria as evidence of a presidency that is doing far better than it appears from news reports.

Though some admit they wish he would not be so inflammatory in his tweeting, it is often maintained that his behavior should not be taken literally.

Yet in a time of national crisis, and as Trump's words resonate around the world, that conceit seems a dangerous one, that could lead the President and the rest of the world into misunderstandings and escalation.

In the end, the President's recent unrestrained conduct also leaves the public with serious questions to consider -- for instance in his preference on many occasions for conspiracy theories over objective truth.

At some point, he might be forced to come before the world and explain why such a potentially bloody war in Asia is necessary.

But his habit of creating alternative realities and eroding trust could come back to haunt him.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/politics/sarah-sanders-trump-tweets-analysis/index.htmlSanders' unreal explanation of Trump's tweetsWashington (CNN) On Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump retweeted three videos purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence against Christians. He did so despite the fact that the videos came from a far-right, anti-Muslim group in Britain and remain unverified.

Which is all beside the point, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

"Whether it is a real video, the threat is real," Sanders told reporters Wednesday morning . "That is what the President is talking about, that is what the President is focused on is dealing with those real threats, and those are real no matter how you look at it."

When pressed on the difference between the videos being real or fake, Sanders replied, "I'm not talking about the nature of the video. I think you're focusing on the wrong thing. The threat is real, and that's what the President is talking about."

Yes. She really said that. The official spokesperson for the White House said that whether or not videos depicting violence committed by Muslims are actually real is beside the point . And that by focusing on whether the videos are real, reporters are "focusing on the wrong things."

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/29/investing/stocks-tech-retail-nasdaq/index.htmlThe world turned upside down: Retail soars, tech sinksWhat's going on with the market?

Tech stocks, which have surged all year, are tanking. But some of the market's biggest laggards of 2017 -- such as retailers, banks and airlines -- were all rallying sharply. Up is down. Black is white.

The Dow hit a new all-time high Wednesday thanks to growing hopes for tax reform and bank-friendly comments from Jerome Powell, President Trump's nominee to succeed Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair during his Senate hearing Tuesday.

The Dow is now up more than 20% this year, and is not far from the 24,000 milestone.

Transportation stocks were surging, led by big gains in airlines Southwest (LUV), Delta (DAL) and JetBlue (JBLU). That's despite a recent spike in oil prices.

And many beaten-down retailers, companies like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Target (TGT), were among the top gainers in the S&P 500.

Meanwhile, big tech stocks -- which have propelled the market higher all year -- were tanking. The Nasdaq fell more than 1%, led by big drops in Google (GOOGL, Tech30) owner Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Netflix (NFLX, Tech30).

Momentum darlings Nvidia (NVDA, Tech30) and PayPal (PYPL, Tech30) and red hot gaming stocks Electronic Arts (EA, Tech30) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI, Tech30) plunged too. They have been some of the market's top stocks throughout most of 2017.

Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, thinks this is a good sign though. He said that it makes sense for investors to start cashing in their chips -- so to speak -- with high-flying tech stocks and look more for bargains in other sectors.

Related: Market soars on tax plan, Powell hearing

Saut said that some of the concerns about Amazon and Walmart (WMT) killing the rest of retail are overblown.

Strong sales on both Black Friday and Cyber Monday is good news for struggling department store chains, as well as specialty retailers who have been thriving lately, like Home Depot (HD), Best Buy (BBY) and Children's Place (PLCE).

Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, agreed that it's encouraging to see a rotation from areas of the market that have been sizzling to ones that have not done as well. The underperforming stocks tend to be cheaper.

"Any pullbacks in certain sectors are healthy given how hot the market has been broadly. Something like this is necessary," Sonders said.

That could be a reason why transportation stocks were rallying too. They have also lagged the surge in tech. Saut added that the transportation stocks were also getting a lift from the strong GDP number reported Wednesday morning.

Economic growth was revised higher -- to the best levels in three years. Saut said a healthier economy outweighs the negative effect of higher oil prices on airlines, truckers and railroads. Crude prices did slip on Wednesday though.

Saut said he wouldn't be abandoning techs just yet though. That's because their earnings are still likely to be better than most other sectors this year and next.

But Saut and others think that the recent rebound for financials may just be in its beginning stages.

Michael Materasso, senior vice president and co-chair of Franklin Templeton's fixed income policy committee, said the banks should benefit from Powell's Fed policies and the rebound in economic growth. Relaxed financial rules won't hurt either.

"The market was impressed with Powell. He spoke like a businessman. His answers were more direct and there was less Fed-speak," Materasso said. "He is Yellen 2.0 on interest rates but more constructive when it comes to deregulation."0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/health/glitter-environment-hazard-microbead-ban-trnd/index.htmlGlitter is not just annoying, it could be bad for the environment(CNN) Glitter is the ultimate supervillain of the craft and makeup world: Charming, but insidious. Use it once, and you'll be vacuuming it out of the carpet and picking it from under your nails until the day you die.

On top of it all, scientists are saying it's dangerous for the environment.

This impending ban prompted some scientists to tell The Independent that glitters -- like loose glitter and those found in makeup and body products -- should be considered a similar hazard.

"I was quite concerned when somebody bought my daughters some shower gel that had glitter particles in it," said Richard Thompson, a professor at Plymouth University who led a study examining how plastics affected marine environments

"That stuff is going to escape down the plughole and potentially enter the environment," he said.

Microplastics can pollute marine environments , leech chemicals into the water and pose harm to marine life if they are ingested.

Dr. Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at Massey University in New Zealand, told The Independent "all glitter should be banned."

Luckily, there is hope for those of us who still choose to punish ourselves for a glittery fix: Some companies make environmentally friendly alternatives that are biodegradable and don't clog up waterways.

For those in the UK, the coming microbead ban will also tackle some shiny concerns: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told The Independent the ban will include glitter in "rinse-off" cosmetics.-1
http://time.com/5041315/garrison-keillor-fired-improper-behavior-allegations/?xid=homepageGarrison Keillor Fired Over Alleged Improper Behavior(MINNEAPOLIS) — Garrison Keillor, the former host of “A Prairie Home Companion,” said Wednesday he has been fired by Minnesota Public Radio over allegations of what the network called improper behavior.

Keillor told The Associated Press of his firing in an email. In a follow-up statement, he said he was fired over “a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard.”

Keillor didn’t detail the allegation to AP, but in an email to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Keillor said he had put his hand on a woman’s bare back in an attempt to console her.

“I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it,” Keillor told the newspaper. “We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.”

Minnesota Public Radio confirmed Keillor had been fired, saying it received a single allegation against Keillor about “inappropriate behavior” and didn’t know of any other allegations. MPR said it was notified of the allegation last month and that it stemmed from Keillor’s conduct when he was responsible for producing “A Prairie Home Companion.”

In his statement to AP, Keillor said it was “poetic irony to be knocked off the air by a story, having told so many of them myself. But I’m 75 and don’t have any interest in arguing about this. And I cannot in conscience bring danger to a great organization I’ve worked hard for since 1969.”

Keillor retired as host of the long-running public radio variety show in 2016. His hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile, is in his second season as “Prairie Home” host. After Keillor retired, he continued to work with MPR on other projects.

The firing Wednesday came shortly after Keillor, an avowed Democrat, wrote a syndicated column that ridiculed the idea that Sen. Al Franken should resign over allegations of sexual harassment.

MPR also said the name of the show, produced and distributed nationwide by American Public Media, would be changed. The show has been named “A Prairie Home Companion” for more than 40 years. MPR also said it will end distribution of “The Writer’s Almanac,” Keillor’s daily reading of a poem and telling of literary events, and end rebroadcasts of “The Best of A Prairie Home Companion” hosted by Keillor.

Keillor started “A Prairie Home Companion” as a Saturday evening show in 1974, featuring tales of his fictional Minnesota hometown of Lake Wobegon “where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.”

The show featured musical acts, folksy humor, parody ads for fake products such as Powdermilk Biscuits and the centerpiece, Keillor delivering a seemingly off-the-cuff monologue, “The News From Lake Wobegon,” in his rich baritone voice.

“A person could not hope for more than what I was given,” Keillor said in his statement Wednesday to AP.

Keillor bowed out with a final show at the Hollywood Bowl in July 2016, and turned the show over to Thile, a mandolinist and frequent “Prairie Home” guest musician. Keillor went on a 28-city bus tour this summer, vowing it would be his last tour, but he continues on the road with solo shows.

Keillor still produces the radio show, “The Writer’s Almanac,” for syndication, and is finishing a Lake Wobegon screenplay and a memoir about growing up in Minnesota.

Thile’s record company referred a request for comment from the AP to MPR.-1

A committee that monitors the deal recommended that the full group of 24 oil-producing nations extend the accord by nine months. But Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak declined to say whether he supported that option, stoking fears about Russia's commitment that have weighed on prices all week.

"Ask five economists," as the Edgar Fiedler adage goes, "and you'll get five different answers."

Yet, when it comes to the tax reform package aimed at fixing our broken system, the undersigned have but one shared perspective: Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people. If, however, the bill fails, the United States risks continued economic underperformance.

In today's globalized economy, capital is mobile in its pursuit of lower tax jurisdictions. Yet, in that worldwide race for job-creating investment, America is not economically competitive.

Here's why: Left virtually untouched for the last 31 years, our chart-topping corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrialized world and a full fifteen percentage points above the OECD average. As a result of forfeiting our competitive edge, we forfeited 4,700 companies from 2004 to 2016 to cheaper shores abroad. As a result of sitting idly by while the rest of the world took steps to lower their corporate rates, we lowered our own workers' wages by thousands of dollars a year.0

And Amazon's head of cloud services just revealed that the company's enterprise division could achieve a similarly grandiose position.

CNBC asked Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy if Amazon could become the world's largest enterprise company.

"It has the chance, I think, to be a really large business," Jassy replied in the interviewed that aired Wednesday. "And I think if we were able to accomplish the right type of customer experience .... as the market moves more and more toward cloud, I think we have a chance to be the largest enterprise company in the world."

Amazon is the undisputed leader in the cloud business overall. But companies like IBM and Microsoft that have longstanding relationships with business leaders have leveraged their sales teams to grow their own cloud businesses.

Still, Jassy's comments echoed those of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who has consistently credited the company's market leadership in e-commerce to "relentless" focus on customers.

"I do think it's possible," Jassy said of becoming the largest enterprise brand. "It's not really the goal I have, or the team has, for itself — we really don't ever really talk about it that way. Our mission is to enable any developer or any company to be able to build all their technology applications on top of our infrastructure technology platform."

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/amazon-seattle-office-space-13-point-6-million-square-feet.htmlAmazon Seattle office space: 13.6 million square feetIf you're wondering just how much of an effect Amazon's HQ2 could have on real estate in the city it chooses, take a look at its presence is in the Seattle metropolitan area.

The company occupies and is committed to own 13.6 million square feet there, or the equivalent of five Empire State Buildings.

That's based on a new report published by BuildZoom, an online marketplace for contractors and homebuilders. According to the report, Amazon's office footprint in Seattle spans 13.6 million square feet across 45 structures in downtown Seattle, Bellevue, Queen Anne and South Lake Union. By comparison, the Empire State Building has 2.8 million.



That's much bigger than the 8.1 million square feet previously disclosed by Amazon. BuildZoom, which looked into publicly available building permits and other media reports for the estimate, said the discrepancy likely comes from the buildings located outside of downtown Seattle (Bellevue and Queen Anne) and future leases and structures currently in development.

The scale of Amazon's headquarters in Seattle gives a clue to what the city that wins Amazon's HQ2 bid will have to expect. Currently, 238 proposals from 54 regions are waiting for Amazon to announce the winner for HQ2 early next year. Amazon said it plans to invest over $5 billion in HQ2 and create over 50,000 new jobs.

"A campus of this magnitude will not be easy for any city to accommodate except for the very largest," BuildZoom chief economist Issi Romem wrote in the report.

Romem pointed out that Amazon will likely help fill office space in the city that wins the HQ2 bid. But at the same time, it could create problems by increasing office rent and pushing out existing tenants, he wrote.

"Amazon will likely reduce vacancy rates, crowd out other tenants, and drive up office rents, especially in the short run. In the longer run, Amazon will expand the office supply and, more generally, help deepen the talent pool," Romem wrote.

http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/29/garrison-keillor-says-hes-been-fired-by-minnesota-public-radio-over-allegations-inappropriate-behavior.htmlGarrison Keillor fired by Minnesota Public Radio over allegations of inappropriate behaviorGarrison Keillor, the former host of "A Prairie Home Companion," was fired on Wednesday by Minnesota Public Radio after the network received allegations of "inappropriate behavior" against the radio personality.

MPR said in a statement that it was “terminating its contracts with Garrison Keillor and his private media companies after recently learning of allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.”

The company said it was notified last month about the allegations, which involved Keillor's days on “A Prairie Home Companion.”

“MPR retained an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations,” the company said. MPR added that it found “no similar allegations” involving Keillor and other staff members.

Keillor told The Associated Press in a statement on Wednesday that he was fired over "a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard." He didn't provide details.

“It’s some sort of poetic irony to be knocked off the air by a story, having told so many of them myself, but I’m 75 and don’t have any interest in arguing about this. And I cannot in conscience bring danger to a great organization I’ve worked hard for since 1969,” Keillor told AP. “A person could not hope for more than what I was given.”

Just yesterday, an Op-Ed written by Keillor appeared in The Washington Post, headlined: “Al Franken should resign? That’s absurd.” The piece referred to an allegation that Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota had groped a woman as “low comedy” that should be forgiven.

“Eleven years later, a talk-show host in LA, she goes public, and there is talk of resignation," Keillor wrote. "This is pure absurdity, and the atrocity it leads to is a code of public deadliness. No kidding.”

The Keillor bombshell came just a few hours after NBC fired “Today” co-host Matt Lauer for “inappropriate sexual behavior.” Both episodes are part of what has become an ongoing trend since Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct toward multiple women spanning decades. Big names such as Charlie Rose, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. have also been accused of sexual misconduct since the Weinstein news emerged in October.

Keillor replaced Lauer as the top trending topic across social media as the news broke, and one user dug up a clip from 1994 in which the radio humorist discussed sexual harassment at a National Press Club event.

“A world in which there is no sexual harassment at all is a world in which there will not be any flirtation," he said.

Keillor retired as host of his long-running public radio variety show in 2016. His hand-picked successor, mandolinist Chris Thile, is in his second season as "Prairie Home" host.

The show, built around a fictional Minnesota town called Lake Wobegon, started in 1974. Keillor often said Lake Wobegon was the place “where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.” The broadcast featured musical acts, folksy humor, parody ads for fake products such as Powdermilk Biscuits and “The News From Lake Wobegon.”

Keillor, in retirement from "Prairie Home," has continued to produce the radio show “The Writer’s Almanac” for syndication, and is finishing a Lake Wobegon screenplay and a memoir about growing up in Minnesota, according to AP.

With just 13 days until the Alabama special election, Col. Lee Busby has entered the tight and bitter race to fill the seat once held by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Busby is running as an independent write-in candidate against Moore, the Republican dogged by sexual misconduct allegations, and Democratic nominee Doug Jones.

“It all started out with me walking down the street thinking: ‘Hell, I’d vote for me before I’d vote for either of those two guys,’” Busby told Fox News.

He said his decision has nothing to do with the handful of women who claim Moore sexually harassed them when they were underage.

“I have no idea what’s at the foundation of all of that controversy,” he said. “It’s not my issue, on a personal level.”

Multiple Republicans have called for Moore’s removal, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John McCain.

ROY MOORE TELLS RALLY CROWD SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS ARE 'DIRTY POLITICS'

Sexual allegations aside, the colonel said he’s always had a gripe with Moore.

“I don’t think his professional qualifications speak to the U.S. Senate,” he said. “He’s a judge, that’s great.”

As for Jones, Busby believes that he fails to represent Alabama voters.

The retired colonel believes his candidacy gives Alabamians a more reliable option, and his lengthy resume proves his qualifications for the job. He served for 31 years in the United States Marine Corps, half of which were spent in active duty. He served in Iraq for about a year in 2007.

He served as deputy chief of staff for Marine Forces Europe and also served as vice chief of staff for Lt. Gen. John Kelly, the current White House chief of staff for President Trump, at the Marine Forces Reserve.

He said it was a privilege to work for Kelly, but he insists his campaign has nothing to do with his former boss’ position in the White House.

“I think you tend to work easier with people you know and trust,” Busby said about Kelly, adding that “this is not based on that.”

Busby said he offers more than military experience.

ROY MOORE SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS CONDEMNED BY GROWING NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS

As an investment banker, entrepreneur, small-business owner, and employee of a multinational cooperation, Busby said he possesses the skills and knowledge to become much more than a military leader.

“It’s actually much more varied than that,” Busby said about his career. “And I think that’s a strength.”

The write-in candidate says he’s never before considered running for political office, but believes this long-shot campaign was “custom made for him.”

“I would never, ever make it in a conventional campaign,” he said. “I’ve never been interested or willing to pay the kind of political dues that one has to pay to move up.”

Even with the controversy surrounding the race, the little-known write-in candidate is a very-long shot contender -- for Alabama voters to elect him, they must write in “Lee Busby” on their ballots.

The bigger question is not whether he'll win, but how his candidacy might tilt the race by drawing votes from Moore or Jones.

Although some have questioned his intentions, particularly since he entered the campaign so late, he says his motives “come from the heart.”

As for his policies, the newcomer plans to support the Republican platform, including repealing and replacing ObamaCare, supporting the tax reform bill, pushing for stiffer immigration laws and supporting a pro-life agenda.

But one reason the boost won’t be as strong as Republicans might like is that the Federal Reserve would be expected to move to keep that growth in check.

Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody’s economy.com, said that if massive tax cuts aren’t offset with correspondingly large tax increases or reductions in government spending, the Fed’s response could even cause the economy to contract.

“If the tax cuts are deficit financed, that is going to juice the economy and it will overheat, significantly raising the odds of a recession early in the next decade,” Zandi told HuffPost.

With the national unemployment rate at or beneath 5 percent for the past two years, many economists consider the economy at or approaching “full employment” ― the lowest amount of unemployment possible without spurring higher-than-ideal inflation. In other words, unemployment is low, but not so low that labor scarcity gives workers enough leverage to drive up wages so dramatically that it prompts runaway inflation.

The Fed has a dual mandate to maximize employment and keep the rate of price growth stable, pursuing the latter goal by targeting a 2 percent inflation rate. If inflation show signs of exceeding the 2 percent threshold, the Fed could hit the brakes by raising an influential interest rate. An increase in the benchmark federal funds rate ― the rate banks charge one another for overnight lending ― would dampen economic growth by raising the cost of credit throughout the economy.

Depending on how fast the Fed decides to raise the benchmark rate, the short-term benefits of the tax cuts could disappear ― or as Zandi fears, prematurely initiate an economic “bust” cycle, or downturn.

Several prominent assessments of the Republican tax cuts likewise anticipate that a counter-response from the Fed would limit the gains from them ― even if they don’t quite share Zandi’s level of concern.

The Joint Committee on Taxation, a panel that analyzes tax legislation for Congress, said in a report Thursday that the Senate version of the bill would increase growth by just 0.8 percent, an estimate roughly in line with other analyses.

“The monetary policy response function used in this analysis assumes that the Fed will act aggressively to counteract any demand stimulus resulting from the proposal because the economy is expected to be operating near full employment,” the JCT said.

In a report on the House version of the legislation, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center also said the Fed’s response would dampen the bill’s impact.

“Interest rates are projected to rise in the short run because the legislation would boost aggregate demand and output, leading the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to avoid a surge in inflation,” the TPC said.

Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump's nominee to become Federal Reserve chairman, testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Nov. 28, 2017.

A key point of contention is whether and how much the tax cuts sought by President Donald Trump will actually boost economic growth to such a degree that inflation will pick up enough to prompt the Fed to act.

Zandi is on one end of the spectrum, warning that the tax cuts would both significantly stimulate the economy and do so at a time when that would be unhealthy. But others are far from certain that the tax cuts will even prompt enough growth to elicit a response from the Fed.

The Republican tax cuts are due to cost $1.4 trillion over a 10-year period, according an estimate by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Absent accompanying spending cuts or tax increases, those cuts would be paid for through borrowing and add to the national debt.

The $1.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money ― and in lean times, it would probably have a greater impact.

But in today’s economy, it is a relative drop in the bucket. Even assuming the cuts are deficit-financed and every last dollar cycles back into the economy through consumer spending, the law would pour $140 billion a year into the American economy on average over 10 years ― an amount equivalent to just under three-quarters of a percentage point of the current gross domestic product of $19.5 trillion.

Many of the wealthy individuals who receive a tax cut, though, will not spend more money, so it is likely that merely half of the tax cuts will go back into the economy, said Joseph Gagnon, a former Federal Reserve economist who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

As a result, Trump’s tax cuts increase the chance that interest rates will rise sooner, but “not by a huge amount,” Gagnon said.

For example, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee, the panel responsible for adjusting interest rates, could decide to raise the federal funds rate four times between now and the end of 2018 instead of the currently expected three times, Gagnon said.

Whether the tax cuts generate so much growth that it prompts push-back from the Fed, or they merely fall short of the rosy expectations projected by GOP lawmakers, Republicans should brace themselves for disappointment, he said.

“The tax cuts are not gonna boost the economy as much as Republicans hope ― in part because I don’t believe in the long-run growth effects that some believe will occur, and in part, because the Fed may raise rates a little faster,” Gagnon said.

Andrew Levin, a former Federal Reserve economist who now teaches at Dartmouth College, was more optimistic that the economy has room to grow before inflation would become a concern for Fed officials, including chairman-designate Jerome Powell.

Even nine years after the 2008 financial crisis, inflation continues to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target, Levin noted. An inflation measure that filters out the more volatile prices of food and energy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the 12-month period ending in October, according to the Department of Commerce.

For Levin and other like-minded economists, this is evidence that the jobs market continues to hold back inflation despite the historically low official unemployment rate of 4.1 percent as of October.

The most inclusive unemployment figure, which counts workforce dropouts and people working part-time involuntarily, remains much higher at 7.9 percent.

That could be one reason why employers have been slower to give workers a raise. Wages before inflation grew just 2.3 percent in the 12 months ending in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The slow wage growth is one of the factors that stems inflation, since employers raise prices to compensate for the added cost of salaries, Levin said.

“If what we see over the next year is hopefully some moderate pickup in wage growth, that would be good,” Levin said. “That would give the Fed breathing room to make a few more modest hikes next year, but keep rates relatively low compared to historical norms.”0

A half-dozen lawmakers and aides told the Times that the president had asked several senators to quickly end the investigation ― including Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is leading the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Intelligence Committee member Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).

Burr recalled his conversation with Trump in an interview with the Times: “It was something along the lines of, ‘I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible.’”

Burr said he replied, “when we have exhausted everybody we need to talk to, we will finish.”

BURR on the record >>



“It was something along the lines of, ‘I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible”https://t.co/fKdDR1Pkym — Jonathan Martin (@jmartNYT) December 1, 2017

Burr told the Times that he did not feel pressured by the president’s request, dismissing the behavior as coming from someone who has “never been in government.” He also acknowledged that other members of the Intelligence Committee had similar interactions with Trump.

“Everybody has promptly shared any conversations that they’ve had,” Burr told the paper.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), however, deemed these conversations “inappropriate” and a breach of the separation of powers, according to the Times.

“It is pressure that should never be brought to bear by an official when the legislative branch is in the process of an investigation,” Feinstein told the Times.

Trump’s reported requests to lawmakers came around the same time special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s potential ties to Russia was beginning to heat up.

The Justice Department appointed Mueller as special counsel in May, after Trump decided to fire FBI Director James Comey as the bureau conducted its own Russia investigation.

Testifying in front of the Senate Intelligence Community in June, Comey said that Trump had asked him to drop any investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn, who was ousted from his post in February, was under investigation by the FBI over his potential ties to Russia.

Comey also told the Senate that Trump had asked him for his loyalty as FBI director and complained that the Russia investigation “cloud” was impairing his ability to perform as president.

There are currently several investigations into potential ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government, including one led by the special counsel, one led by Burr and the Senate Intelligence Committee, and one led by the House Intelligence Committee.-1

Simmons responded to screenwriter Jenny Lumet’s accusation that he sexually violated her in 1991 by issuing a statement apologizing for “thoughtless and insensitive” actions in previous relationships. He admitted that Lumet may have been frightened on the night of the alleged incident, but he denied that he forced himself on her.

“While her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real,” Simmons said. “While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologize.”

Munn wasn’t pleased with Simmons’ response and mockingly translated the statement using a “Douchebag Dictionary.”

“Yo Russell, your statement was a little wonky, lemme help you out,” the “X-Men” star tweeted Thursday, along with a highlighted screenshot of Simmons’ statement.

“According to the Douchebag Dictionary I believe your statement translates to ― Our memories are different because I see women as disposable entertainment and Jenny thought she was a human being. Oops!” Munn wrote.

In a Thursday column for The Hollywood Reporter, Lumet described a night in 1991 filled with dread after Simmons allegedly offered her a ride home from a New York City restaurant but instead took her to his apartment.

Lumet wrote that Simmons cornered her in the elevator, pressing into her with his body, hands and mouth. Then he moved her into the bedroom where, she said, he penetrated her. At no time, Lumet maintained, did she ever tell Simmons she wanted to have sex with him.

“I desperately wanted to keep the situation from escalating,” Lumet wrote. “I wanted you to feel that I was not going to be difficult. I wanted to stay as contained as I could.”

The daughter of acclaimed director Sidney Lumet is the second woman to publicly accuse the Def Jam Records co-founder of sexual assault. Earlier this month in the Los Angeles Times, Keri Claussen Khalighi accused Simmons of sexually assaulting her when she was 17 in 1991, while Simmons friend and filmmaker Brett Ratner allegedly did nothing to help her.

Variety also reported this month that police investigated both Simmons and Ratner for alleged sexual battery of a 29-year-old woman in 2001, but no charges were brought.

Munn herself is one of a growing number of women and men who have publicly outed their alleged sexual abusers and harassers ― many of whom held powerful positions ― in the wake of movie producer Harvey Weinstein’s downfall.

Earlier this month, Munn alleged that Ratner had masturbated in front of her without her consent in 2004. She later told The New York Times that she doubted the increased awareness of sexual abuse in Hollywood would actually change the industry, saying that Ratner still had a $450 million deal with Warner Bros.

“If you ask me, now, do I feel good? Do I feel like I have justice? No,” Munn told The New York Times. “There’s an understanding that there will be backlash in the marketplace and to their bottom line if they don’t make these big announcements.”-1

The satanic messages were quickly echoed and amplified by Fox News’ Sean Hannity and The Drudge Report, the network found.

NBC analyzed a database of the messages linked to known Russian troll accounts revealed by the House Intelligence Committee last month. Though the tweets have been taken down and are no longer accessible to the public, they are still available in archives, according to NBC.

One of the more grotesque “story lines” propagated by the trolls included fake posts that Clinton and campaign manager John Podesta participated in a satanic ritual and supported a devil-worshipping “priestess.” The hoax was linked to a question about a “spirit cooking” artistic performance in one of the campaign’s hacked emails. The emails were hacked, according to U.S. intelligence, in an operation orchestrated by the Kremlin.

Neither Podesta nor Clinton ever responded to the question. Artist Marina Abramović never actually did the “spirit cooking” performance, which wasn’t satanic, in any case. Yet the trolls tweeted that the Clinton Foundation paid “occult Spirit Cooking priestess $10,000,” according to an archived tweet obtained by NBC. Other tweets said Podesta and Clinton attended the “Spirit Cooking satanic ritual.” The lie was quickly referred to in a tweet by Hannity and on his website. The eventual retelling by Hannity and The Drudge Report became even more sensational.

Twitter

Other tweets generated by the trolls spewed racist messages and accused the Democrats of being sympathetic to rapists, according to NBC.

The bizarre “Pizzagate” tale that emerged during the campaign falsely linking Clinton and Podesta to a nonexistent child sex trafficking ring at a Washington, D.C., pizza shop was was also pushed by Russian trolls — and again amplified by American right-wing conspiracy theorists. Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, pleaded guilty to federal and local charges after he opened fire last December at the eatery, believing he was attacking criminals. Fortunately, no one was injured.

Michael McFaul, a U.S. ambassador to Russia for two years during the Obama administration, told the network that the tweets are proof that the Kremlin aimed to support Donald Trump, hurt Clinton and generally create chaos during the election.-1

In films you can imagine people clearing security checks with a quick blood test that matches their genetic profile to something held on a futuristic database.

The team from Colombia University and the New York Genome Centre have developed a method to quickly (and accurately) identify people from their DNA and cell lines.

Current DNA testing of blood samples (for example, in cases of paternity investigation) can take as much as a week to return results.

The idea for immediate use was to enable scientists to check cancer samples that might have been mislabeled or contaminated - a major reason why lots of cancer studies fail.

But it also has real-world application in being able to identify victims in a mass disaster or analyse a crime scene in real time.

Study senior author, Yaniv Erlich, says: “Our method opens up new ways to use off-the-shelf technology to benefit society.”

The technology is designed to run on an instrument that is the size of a credit card (known as the MinION) so would be portable for investigators. It works by pulling in strands of DNA through microscopic pores and reads out sequences of DNA letters or nucleotides (e.g. A, T, C, G).

The study’s lead author Sophie Zaaijer compares to the brain’s ability to make out a bird from a few telling features in an abstract Picasso line-drawing.

Previously the high error-rate and large sequencing gaps had stopped this being useful for human cells, with their billions of nucleotides, but the updated version of the MinION has given it “near-perfect accuracy”.

You might want to get out the heavy-duty thermals and stand outside to catch a glimpse of something pretty special. That’s because Earth will have front row seats for the first and last supermoon of 2017 in the next few days, known as the ‘full cold moon’. Appearing 14% larger and 30% brighter than the moon usually does, according to NASA, it will be well worth looking out for.

What Is A Supermoon? NASA says that a supermoon happens when a full moon coincides with the moon’s perigee - meaning the point in its orbit at which it is closest to Earth (the farthest point is known as apogee). The moon is usually about 238,000 miles away from Earth but when in perigee it is about 222, 135 miles away - that’s a difference of 30,516 miles. It is this combination of being physically closer to earth and being a full moon that makes it look so much larger and brighter. “Generally speaking, full moons occur near perigee every 13 months and 18 days, so it’s not all that unusual,” Geoff Chester of the US Naval Observatory told NASA Science News. When Can I See The Supermoon? The moon will rise on Sunday 3 December and becomes totally full at 15.47 GMT, though of course it will be big and full all night. It won’t actually reach perigee – or the point at which it’s closest to Earth – until the next morning at 08.45 GMT.

The report includes a breakdown of statistics on the number of kids and young people who have been referred to NHS-funded secondary mental health, autism and learning disabilities services in England. Out of the 2.6 million people known to have been referred to these three services in 2016/17, 556,790 were under 18.

However, the report hinted that the actual number of children accessing thee services may be greater as the authors believe “the statistics may undercount people aged under 18”. “It is likely that the level of coverage of mental health services for children and young people in the source of these statistics is good, but lower than that for adult mental health or learning disabilities and autism services,” the report stated. This is because data submissions were not received from around 25% of the expected organisations providing services for children and young people. The report stated: “We are working closely with providers who have not yet submitted data and expect coverage and data quality to increase for this area in future submissions.” The report looked at the ages of children most likely to be in contact with these services and compared them by gender. The results revealed that among children aged 14 to 18, girls were more likely to be in contact with secondary support services than boys. And 16-to 17-year-old girls were most likely to have been referred to mental health, learning disabilities and autism services, out of all young people. However within the “under 14” age group, boys were approximately a third more likely to be in contact with mental health, learning disabilities and autism services (as shown in the chart below).

NHS Digital

Mental health and autism charities contacted by HuffPost UK stated that it would be difficult to comment on the reasons for this gender shift, as the report did not differentiate between referrals for the three different services - mental health, autism and learning difficulties. NHS Digital stated they grouped the figures to include mental health, learning disability and autism services because many people who have a learning disability or autism use mental health services and people in learning disabilities and autism services may also have a mental health problem. This means a single referral may include contact with either type of service. Commenting on the statistics for young people, Matt Blow, policy manager at YoungMinds told HuffPost UK he was “pleased” to see the annual report has included data on children and mental health for the first time. “Children and young people’s mental health is at crisis point, and with 50% of all life-long mental health problems first appearing by the age of 14, it’s vital that mental health support is provided as soon as possible to those who need it,” he said. “The last in-depth national prevalence study of children’s mental health was carried out in 2004, before the rise of social media. The Government needs to commit to commissioning regular, in-depth prevalence studies to identify risk factors and trends over time, and to ensure that mental health services are commissioned based on an accurate picture of need.” Sarah Lambert, head of policy and public affairs at the National Autistic Society, said: “Due to the fact the Government doesn’t regularly record a person’s autism diagnosis, it is hard for the National Autistic Society to comment on these figures, as they may not accurately reflect the autistic population. This is something we campaigned for during our Autism Diagnosis crisis campaign and we’re pleased to say that the Government has now publicly committed to collecting and publishing autism diagnosis and diagnosis waiting times in England from April 2018. “However, research suggests that 71% of autistic children develop mental health problems in their childhood, despite autism not being a mental health condition. This can often happen if the support that an autistic child needs is not available, and can impact on a child’s wellbeing and education. In fact, our recent education report that we launched alongside the All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism revealed that over 50% of autistic children are not happy at school. “Far too many autistic people in England are living with avoidable mental health problems, if we can provide the right support for autistic people from the beginning, we can ensure their lives can be transformed. It is therefore essential that the Government ensures all autistic children are provided with the right mental health support and that a national autism and education strategy is put in place.”-1

To change this and challenge stigma, here are seven things people with HIV want you to know.

Improved treatments now mean that for many men and women, their HIV is undetectable - meaning the HIV levels in their blood are so low they cannot be detected by tests used to measure viral load and that the disease cannot be passed on through sexual intercourse or to a new generation.

A 20-year-old patient starting therapy today is expected to live to 78 years old, similar to the general population, which has a life expectancy of 81 years.

Research looking at data of more than 88,000 people with HIV shows young people receiving treatment in 2017 now have a “near-normal” life expectancy thanks to improvements in antiretroviral therapy.

Lack of awareness around the improvements in treatment could be one explanation.

Earlier this year research found that two in five people “would be uncomfortable dating someone living with HIV on effective treatment”.

With high profile faces like Prince Harry talking about HIV , stigma around the illness is slowly but surely reducing, but we still have a long, long way to go.

1. It doesn’t make you a bad person.

Gus Cairns, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1985, wants the media and the public to stop villainising those affected.

“People with HIV have come to signify danger. To mix in a risky metaphor, we’re seen as the viral terrorists walking among you, our virus primed to explode,” he blogged on HuffPost UK.

“Untrue. We’re not bad people. Anyone can catch HIV in an unguarded moment, during a bad period in their lives or just through bad luck.”

2. Women get HIV too.

Ann Marie Byrne, a grandmother and campaigner who is living with HIV, believes “women are often forgotten” when discussions about HIV take place, both in everyday conversation and in the media.

“We are considered to be a lower risk group than say gay men and yet as women we are stigmatised as much if not more as the media often portray us as ‘promiscuous’ and deserving of contracting this virus,” she previously said.

“[People on] social media use words like ‘Karma’ and speak of ‘this disgusting disease’. We are portrayed as being ‘dirty’ and less worthy of sympathy than women living with other medical conditions because of our so called ‘lifestyle choices’ which of course, is totally untrue.”

3. You can still have a family.

In 2015 Andrew Pulsipher, from Phoenix, US, posted a photo of himself with his wife and three healthy children to dispel myths that having HIV means you can’t have children.

Pulsipher has been HIV positive since birth, having had the disease passed on from his parents. He and his wife had their three children through fertility treatment.

“Having a negative family can be the most positive thing in your life” he said.

“I know HIV has a negative stigma, but that it doesn’t have to and I want to help change that. It is a treatable disease and you can live a normal life with it. I am proof of that.”

4. Sex education isn’t good enough.

HIV campaigner James Hanson was diagnosed with the illness at the age of 18 and says more needs to be done to educate LGBT+ teenagers on the risks.

“I strongly believe the education system fails young LGBTI+ people every day,” he blogged on HuffPost UK.

“We have won the battle of equal age of consent and equal marriage in the UK, the next fight is to make inclusive SRE compulsory in all schools.

“The education system has one of the biggest influences on young people’s lives, therefore they have a real key responsibility to make sure young LGBT+ people are leaving school with the [information] they need for life.”

5. There’s a lot of shame involved with HIV.

Paul Thorn set up the radio show HIV Happy Hour to raise awareness of what it’s really like to live with the illness.

He told HuffPost UK learning to manage internalised shame is a huge challenge after diagnosis.

“I lived for many years feeling ashamed because I have HIV. It has prevented me from going for jobs that I wanted and seeking relationships with people who I found attractive because I thought they wouldn’t would want me,” he said.

“That kind of feeling can exist in the very core of you to the point that you can’t stand the sight of yourself in the mirror. It has taken me many years to realise that I am worth something and to start caring about myself, maybe even love myself a little.”

6. You can still get tattoos.

There are no documented cases of HIV transmission due to tattooing, but due to common misconceptions around the illness many people do not realise this.

Rob Curtis previously told HuffPost UK of how he was turned away by a tattoo artist after telling the receptionist he was HIV positive.

“I was also really shocked that this would even be an issue. I had told the studio that I was HIV+ and taking anti-viral medication which means it’s not possible to infect someone else,” he said.

“The artist should have known this, so I felt really disappointed that she was letting her stigma get in the way of her art.”

7. Being diagnosed is a good thing.

Philip Christopher Baldwin was diagnosed with HIV in 2010 at the age of 24. He says being tested and receiving a positive diagnosis is better than living in ignorance.

“There are approximately 17,000 people in the UK who do not know their HIV status. If you are HIV positive and do not know, your health could be compromised. Two-fifths of HIV positive people in the UK are diagnosed late,” he blogged on HuffPost UK.

“By testing negative you put an end to any doubts that you may have about your HIV status. Test positive and you can start treatment, thereby ensuring you remain healthy.”-1

The online shopping bonanza is expected to bring in as much as $6 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights, which tracks online spending at America's 100 largest retail websites.

Digital sales have been strong this holiday shopping season: American shoppers spent a record $5 billion online in 24 hours on Black Friday, a 16.9% increase over last year, according Adobe Digital Insights.

The performance is welcome news for embattled retailers who were having a dismal 2017. Store closings have more than tripled this year to a record 6,700.

2. Dollar under pressure: The U.S. dollar was trading lower against major currencies on Monday.

Investors are looking ahead to a U.S. Senate vote that could come later this week on tax reform.

If the legislation gets through the Senate, it will have to be reconciled with the bill the House passed earlier this month. That process could be messy, and progress could stall.

"The dollar would get a bit of a lift from anything that convinced markets that a growth-supportive package was really likely but more muddle seems more probable," said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale.

The dollar suffered its biggest fall on Monday against the euro, which got a boost from strong eurozone economic data and signs that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is making progress in forming a government.

3. Time's new owners: Media firm Meredith (MDP) has agreed to buy the publisher Time Inc. (TIME) for $2.8 billion.

Acquiring the legendary magazine business gives Meredith control of dozens of big titles such as People, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly.

Meredith already publishes several top magazines, including Parents, Shape and Better Homes & Gardens.

It plans to sell a sizable chunk of the combined business -- $650 million worth -- to a company owned by GOP mega-donors Charles and David Koch.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/30/investing/oil-opec-production-cuts-prices/index.htmlOPEC and allies extend oil production cuts by 9 monthsOPEC is sticking with its production cuts.

The cartel and other major producers including Russia agreed Thursday to extend production cuts until the end of 2018.

Saudi Arabia, the group's de-facto leader, pushed to prolong the limits, which are designed to reduce a global oil glut, by nine months.

The country's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, confirmed the agreement at a press conference following the coalition's meeting in Vienna.

"Our key metric is to bring inventories down to their normal levels," he said.

U.S. crude futures were volatile on Thursday, swinging from nearly $58 per barrel to lows near $56.50. The were trading at $57.30 after the agreement was confirmed.

Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the agreement was a "success" and "very constructive."

OPEC and its allies first agreed to slash output in late 2016, a response to oversupply and an oil price crash. They had been scheduled to expire in March 2018.

Data from the International Energy Agency and OPEC show the countries have largely stuck to their agreement. And there are signs that it's working.

"A lot has been achieved towards stabilizing the market, but to build on this success in 2018 will require continued discipline," the IEA said in its latest monthly report.

Prices have more than doubled from the extremely low levels hit in early 2016 when there was severe oversupply.

Croft said that agreement struck Thursday could lead to further gains. Libya and Nigeria -- two OPEC members that were originally excluded from the deal -- both signed up.

The challenge for Saudi Arabia has been to keep producers with different priorities on board.

The cartel is aware of its diminishing power to influence the market as shale producers gain more clout. One big reason is the rise of American oil producers, which are not part of the output agreement.

"The days of OPEC alone being able to take the load of swinging supply to fix imbalances are over," al-Falih said.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/30/news/economy/india-economy-gdp-growth-recovery/index.htmlIndia's economy bounces back from slowdownIndia's economy has bounced back from a year-long slowdown, but not enough to regain the global growth crown from China.

Gross domestic product grew by 6.3% in the three months through Sept. 30, up from 5.7% in the previous quarter. That compares with China's growth rate of 6.8% in the same period.

Still, the numbers will be music to the ears of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose two biggest policy decisions of the past year have been widely blamed for a slump that cut growth to its slowest pace in three years.

India was the world's fastest growing major economy at the end of 2016, with GDP expanding by 7%.

But the sudden ban last November of India's two most valuable rupee notes at the time -- accounting for 86% of the country's cash -- stunned industry and brought activity in some sectors of the economy to a screeching halt.

An overhaul of the country's tax system in July, replacing myriad state levies with a single set of national rates, dealt business another blow, even if it should help the economy in the long run.

Related: What did Modi get wrong with India's economy?

India appears to have put those troubles behind it for now.

The stronger growth "indicates that perhaps the impact of two very significant structural reforms... is now behind us, and hopefully in the coming quarters we can look for an upwards trajectory," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said at a press conference shortly after the data was released.

"I think the most significant aspect is the fact that this quarter's positive result has been impacted significantly by the growth in manufacturing," he added.

"The improvement in industry is eye-catching," Priyanka Kishore, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics, told CNNMoney.

Kishore added that India's national tax overhaul continues to drag on growth, but the economy appears to have shrugged off the effects of the cash ban.

The reversal in India's fortunes should be sustainable, economists predicted.

"Growth will continue to accelerate over the coming quarters," wrote Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics, in a note.

"Recovery is underway," Oxford Economics' Kishore said. "Next year we should be looking at these headwinds turning into tailwinds for the economy."1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/middleeast/reza-zarrab-us-trial-erdogan/index.htmlErdogan helped Iran evade US sanctions, witness claimsNew York (CNN) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan personally intervened in a scheme that allowed Iran to dodge US and UN sanctions, a gold trader with ties to the Turkish government claimed in explosive court testimony in New York on Thursday.

It's the first time Erdogan has been named in the closely-watched US criminal case over Iran's violations of international sanctions and movement of billions of dollars.

The case's central figure, Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader, was arrested in Miami last year and has since been the case's top named defendant. There are eight other defendants facing similar charges.

He quietly cut a plea deal last month and admitted to defrauding the United States, money laundering, and bank fraud, according to court documents.

On Thursday, Zarrab testified in federal court about Erdogan's alleged role in Zarrab's scheme, which involved laundering funds from Iranian oil and gas sales through Turkish banks, including the state-run bank, Halkbank.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/01/europe/damian-green-computer-pornography-intl/index.htmlBritish 'deputy PM' Damian Green caught in porn claimsLondon (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May's de facto deputy, Damian Green, has been accused of having "thousands" of thumbnail pornographic images on his work computer.

The material -- none of which was deemed to be illegal -- is alleged to have been discovered during a raid in 2008 aimed at targeting government leaks, according to Neil Lewis, a former Scotland Yard detective who was involved in the case.

Lewis told the BBC that he was "shocked" at the volume of material on the computer and that he had "no doubt whatsoever" that the images had been accessed by Green.

This latest revelation will heap further embarrassment on Green and May, whose government is already facing attacks on multiple fronts.

Green is already the subject of a government investigation after he was accused by journalist Kate Maltby of making unwanted advances toward her during a meeting in 2015. Green has described those allegations as "completely untrue" and "deeply hurtful."

The latest revelations follow a story in the Sunday Times last month alleged that "extreme" pornographic material had been found on Green's computer.

Lewis says was surprised at Green's denial, and had come forward in support of the Sunday Times source, another senior retired police officer. Lewis said he carried out the raid at Green's office and examined the computer himself.

He said that Green's denial of the original allegations was "quite amazing" and said he felt compelled to speak out.

"The computer was in Mr Green's office, on his desk, logged in, his account, his name," said Lewis told the BBC.

"In between browsing pornography, he was sending emails from his account, his personal account, reading documents ... it was ridiculous to suggest anybody else could have done it."

Lewis added that none of the images found were "extreme" but that analysis of the computer suggested that they had been viewed "extensively" over a three-month period, sometimes for hours at a time.

A spokesman for Green, who holds the title of First Secretary of State, said he would not comment on the latest claims. "It would be inappropriate for Mr Green to comment on these allegations while the Cabinet Office investigation is ongoing; however, from the outset he has been very clear that he never watched or downloaded pornography on the computers seized from his office.

"He maintains his innocence of these charges and awaits the outcome of the investigation."

Another Conservative MP, Andrew Mitchell, questioned why Lewis had come forward. "I think it is highly questionable whether a retired police officer should misuse this sort of material in this way and I think the police need to explain why there was any record kept of entirely legal activity," he told the BBC.

In his BBC interview, Lewis rejected suggestions that Green's computer might have been hacked, saying: "It would be a very bizarre situation for somebody to hack a parliamentary computer to place pornography."

"The shocking thing, as I was viewing, I noticed a lot of pornography -- thumbnails -- which indicated web browsing.

"There were a lot of them. I was surprised to see that on a parliamentary computer. I had to take a step back, because I wasn't expecting that. When you ask me a number, I couldn't tell you. There were thousands."

Lewis also rejected claims somebody else could have been viewing the material on Green's computer, saying: "It was so extensive, whoever had done it would have to have pushed Mr Green to one side to say 'Get out, I'm using your computer'."-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/entertainment/the-shape-of-water-review/index.html'The Shape of Water' flows into sweet, strange love story(CNN) Guillermo del Toro's visual artistry thrives in the realm of fantasy. The director funnels those skills into a sweet but strange container with "The Shape of Water," a sensual if not fully buoyant reimagining of monster classics that essentially transforms "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" into an unlikely land-sea love story.

For those who consider "Pan's Labyrinth" del Toro's masterpiece, that status remains unthreatened by this appealing but relatively slight film, which is intriguingly set during the early 1960s, informed by a Cold War sensibility, and possesses a broader message about conquering prejudices and fears associated with the different and unknown.

Sally Hawkins provides the movie's melancholy emotional spine as Elisa, a mute cleaning woman in a secret government facility. She's understandably shocked to discover that the lab has become home to an aquatic, man-like creature (Doug Jones, who also disappeared under makeup in del Toro's aforementioned "Pan's" and "Hellboy"), captured by a federal agent (Michael Shannon, at his venomous best) who tortures him with a shock prod.

" allowfullscreen>

Sad and lonely, Elisa's support system includes her caring co-worker (Octavia Spencer) and gay neighbor (Richard Jenkins), dealing with his own difficulties finding love in this closeted era. She also encounters an unexpectedly sympathetic figure in the form of a scientist (Michael Stuhlbarg) working on the project, the purpose of which -- other than keeping "the asset," as it's called, away from the Soviets -- is, like many of the film's obvious questions, left largely shrouded in mystery.

Then again, all of that's really secondary to the gradual bond that develops between the unusual captive and the highly empathetic Elisa, which begins innocently enough, if symbolically, with a hard-boiled egg.

"There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions," Lauer said in a statement provided to CNN. "To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC."

"Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly," Lauer said.

The statement was timed for release with Thursday's "Today" show. NBC read the entire statement aloud on the morning show.

"Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I'm committed to beginning that effort," Lauer said. "It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It's been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace."

On Thursday's "Today," Savannah Guthrie was once again joined by Hoda Kotb, who also filled in for Lauer on Wednesday.

"It is a difficult morning here again," Kotb said. "Our top story is once again about our former colleague."

Stories about the fallout, containing new allegations of sexual harassment by Lauer, were featured on the front pages of Thursday's newspapers and early morning newscasts.

When NBC News chairman Andy Lack fired Lauer on Tuesday night, the proximate reason was a detailed harassment complaint filed by a female NBC employee on Monday night.

But Lack also knew that Variety and The New York Times were working on in-depth investigations.

Variety's story came out on Wednesday afternoon. It contained new allegations of sexual harassment by three unnamed women.

The New York Times published a chilling account later in the day. The newspaper said it interviewed a former employee who said Lauer "summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her." The accuser left NBC one year later. She asked The Times for anonymity.

The misconduct allegations came as a profound shock to many "Today" show viewers -- and to some NBC staffers.

Some NBC veterans said they did not recognize the man they were now reading about.

Some of the same sentiments were heard last week when CBS fired Charlie Rose.

This is an unprecedented moment in morning television, with two empty chairs on two network broadcasts -- "Today" and "CBS This Morning" -- because of sexual harassment allegations against anchormen.

"Today" is grappling with a scandal that threatens NBC's bottom line. The "Today" show makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year through ad sales, so any deterioration in the ratings will hurt the network's parent company, NBCUniversal.

The ratings race between "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America" is legendary. In recent years the third-place "CBS This Morning" has been edging closer to them.

Now there's a sense in the television news business that anything could happen -- that viewers may react to the NBC and CBS scandals in any number of ways.

Insiders are also speculating about who might take over for Lauer. He was the face of the "Today" show for 20 years and had about a year left on his contract when he was suddenly terminated.

"The arrival of hard consequences for these men may have come too late in the news industry, but media organizations are unquestionably leading the national reckoning now underway," media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote in Thursday's New York Times.

"For the news business, this is the way it has to be: Its main product, after all, is integrity, which, in the case of the networks, is personified by those who sit behind the desk," he wrote. "Once the audience's trust is lost, the entire enterprise falls apart."-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/politics/kate-steinle-verdict-reactions/index.htmlTrump slams 'disgraceful' Kate Steinle verdictStory highlights A jury acquitted Garcia Zarate of murder and involuntary manslaughter charges

Trump often cited Steinle's death as a warning against so-called sanctuary cities

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump slammed what he called a "disgraceful verdict" in the 2015 shooting death of Kate Steinle by an undocumented immigrant, a crime he seized on during his presidential campaign as part of his call for tougher immigration policies.

"The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!" he tweeted Friday morning in the wake of a jury's acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who had been deported five times before the shooting.

"No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration," the President tweeted hours after the verdict.

A jury acquitted Garcia Zarate of murder and involuntary manslaughter charges, as well as assault with a firearm. Garcia Zarate was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, however. His attorneys claimed the shooting was accidental. The Justice Department is considering bringing federal charges against Garcia Zarate, according to spokesperson Sarah Flores. All available federal options are on the table, CNN is told.

In particular, on the campaign trail, Trump often cited Steinle's death as a warning against so-called sanctuary cities. The term loosely refers to jurisdictions that in some way do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The stated reasons vary, from protecting undocumented immigrants to preserving local law enforcement's ability to gain the trust and cooperation of communities. Some jurisdictions have also been barred by the courts from complying with certain federal requests.

http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/us/no-known-evidence-assault-border-patrol-agent-death-invs/index.htmlNo known evidence of assault in border agent deathVan Horn, Texas (CNN) Less than a day after a Border Patrol agent died and another was badly injured in a November 18 incident in West Texas, President Donald Trump tweeted that "We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!"

The next day, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered a $20,000 reward for information in "this murder of" Border Patrol Agent Rogelio "Roger" Martinez, 36. "Help us catch this killer," he wrote on Twitter.

But ten days into the FBI's investigation, facts to back up claims of an assault by a unknown assailant remain thin. Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke said Thursday that the circumstances around the death of Martinez remain a mystery.

The FBI has released no information to support the idea that Martinez was murdered, or that he and the surviving agent were attacked. (CNN has confirmed the identity of the second agent, but Customs and Border Protection requested that he not be named, citing "security concerns.") A person familiar with the investigation said that as of late Tuesday the agency had not ruled out any possibilities.

That includes the possibility that the two men simply fell into a concrete-lined culvert adjacent to Interstate 10, about 12 miles east of their base in the small town of Van Horn. That is the area where they were found about 11:20 p.m. on that dark night, several hours after the moon had set. Martinez was alive, but had traumatic head injuries and broken bones. The other agent had a contusion to the back of his head requiring stitches, among other injuries, according to local Border Patrol union representative Lee Smith. Both men were taken first to a hospital in Van Horn, then airlifted to a trauma center in El Paso. Martinez died on November 19; the second agent was released from the hospital on November 22, walking with the help of a cane.

On November 21, the FBI's Special Agent in Charge of the El Paso Division, Emmerson Buie Jr., said at a press conference that the FBI was investigating the incident as "a potential assault of a federal officer." The bureau announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone involved.

The FBI is seeking information on potential assault of Rogelio Martinez.

FBI spokeswoman Jeanette Harper said Wednesday that the bureau is investigating "a few responses to the combined reward of $45,000." But she said the FBI had no further information to share.

"We're in fact-finding mode. We're trying to answer all those questions everybody has," she said.

Gov. Abbott's office said the reward offer had resulted in tips which were passed along to the FBI. They had not responded as of late Thursday to repeated queries about what led Abbott to describe the incident as a murder.

Late Thursday, the FBI announced a digital billboard campaign covering areas near the southwest border, from Arizona to Texas, seeking information from anyone who drove through Van Horn between 10 p.m. and midnight on November 18. The campaign highlights the $45,000 in reward money available for information that helps resolve how Martinez died and the second agent was injured.

In the meantime, friends and family have little to go on.

"They haven't told us anything more about what happened," said Elvia Martinez, the mother of Roger Martinez, at her home in El Paso on Tuesday.

"It does look weird" that there's so little information, said Israel Velasquez, a close friend of Martinez who flew in from Cincinnati to serve as a pallbearer at his funeral. "And what I've heard is weird," he added, declining to elaborate.

Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the agents' union, was one early voice just after the incident calling it "a brutal attack." "This was something well-thought out and planned," he said.

Cabrera said Tuesday evening that he remained convinced the agents were ambushed, based on his experience as an agent, on evidence he said he wasn't at liberty to discuss, and on that $25,000 FBI reward. If it had merely been a fall, he said, surely the FBI could have confirmed that within a week and a half.

"It bugs me they say they're investigating this as a potential assault," he said. "If someone dies, shouldn't it be a homicide? I hope they can get moving on this thing. A lot of agents want answers."

The area where Martinez and the other agent were injured is known to be a drop-off point for bundles of marijuana carried through the desert from the Mexican border, about 30 miles south. On November 10, in one of two such seizures that day, agents found six 50-pound backpacks of marijuana stuffed into a culvert under I-10, near where the two agents were found on November 18.

Border Patrol spokesman Rush Carter said he couldn't confirm whether it was precisely the same culvert. But he said such traffic is common enough for agents on the night shift from the Van Horn station to make it a regular part of their duties to check the culverts for contraband.

That may have been what Martinez was doing. According to the Border Patrol, Martinez and the second agent were patrolling in separate vehicles. It's unclear why both ended up at the culvert. The Border Patrol does not have a record of a radio transmission from either agent asking for help, though given the remote location, it is possible either would have radioed only agents who were close by -- something that would not have been recorded.

At some point that night -- neither the Border Patrol nor the FBI have released the time frame -- the second agent called his wife, disoriented, telling her he didn't know where he was. She then called the Van Horn station to tell them something was wrong, according to a Border Patrol agent who spoke directly with her.

According to Lee Smith, the local union rep who met with the surviving agent, that officer said he doesn't remember what happened that night. The last thing he remembers is arriving at work that day, Smith said. Contacted at his home, the agent declined a request for an interview.

The bottom of the culvert where the two agents were found is about an 8- to 10-foot drop from a narrow, rocky verge along the highway. Six square tunnels run beneath the highway, each just over 6 feet high. Four days after the incident, police tape attached to a rock marked the spot.

Culberson County Sheriff Oscar Carrillo, one of the responders that night, told CNN "it did not look like the scene of an attack or an ambush," and that to suggest that it was would be "very premature."

Then, too, neither the Border Patrol nor the local sheriff that night put out an all-points bulletin known as a BOLO, for "be on the lookout" for possible assailants, to other law-enforcement agencies.

"There wasn't enough information to put a BOLO together," said Carter, the Border Patrol spokesman. "But we definitely did reach out to law enforcement partners."

Carter also said that, since the incident, the Border Patrol has beefed up enforcement activity in the area, borrowing agents from other stations to the east and west.

The Van Horn station normally has about four dozen agents. The Border Patrol declined to say how many more agents have been brought in.

Historically, the Big Bend Sector, which includes the Van Horn Station where Martinez and the other agent worked, has been relatively safe. For the fiscal year ended September 30, the 511 agents in that sector reported a total of seven incidents in which 11 agents were assaulted, the fewest of any of the nine sectors along the US-Mexico border, according to CBP data. By contrast, the Rio Grande Valley Sector reported 357 assaults against agents last fiscal year.

But it remains unclear whether the two agents were, in fact, assaulted. The FBI hasn't excluded any alternatives, according to spokeswoman Harper, including some sort of accident or an altercation between the agents.

Whatever happened, Israel Velasquez said that he knows that his friend Roger Martinez loved his work and "had total trust in his job and his training."

And he said that while Martinez's family and friends want to know how and why he died, "at the end of the day, he's gone. That's all I know."-1

Dmitriev is the chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund

Washington (CNN) Blackwater founder Erik Prince testified to House lawmakers that he met the head of a Russian investment fund earlier this year -- but he insisted it was not part of an effort to set up a Russian backchannel with the Trump administration, multiple sources told CNN.

In private testimony Thursday, Prince informed the House Intelligence Committee that he met in the Seychelles with Kirill Dmitriev, who is the chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, at the request of the United Arab Emirates to discuss business opportunities. The meeting on the island in the Indian Ocean, he said, lasted roughly 20 minutes after dinner over a beer.

Prince insisted he did not have the meeting at the request of the Trump administration, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation.

Prince has come under scrutiny after it was reported that the January meeting was an apparent effort to set up a backchannel Russian communication with the Trump administration, and that senior Trump officials had authorized the meeting.

But Prince downplayed his ties to the Trump's team, merely saying he was a Trump donor and had met the President on only one occasion, the sources said. CNN has previously reported that Prince met with members of Trump's incoming national security team during the presidential transition, and that he boasted about his influence in the Trump orbit around that same time.-1

MIAMI (CBSMiami) – A Miami-Dade police officer has been cleared of any wrongdoing after he was caught on camera punching a female Canes football fan during a game.

In the midst of a UM game at Hard Rock Stadium, 30-year-old Bridget Freitas was being hauled out of the seats. Fans had complained that she was abusive and drunk.

As the officers carried Freitas up the steps to the exit, she took a couple of swings at Miami-Dade Officer Douglas Ross. Freitas struck him the eye, he socked her in the head.

Miami-Dade Police launched an investigation – an investigation that cleared Ross of any wrongdoing.

According to a use of force report officer, Ross acted within Miami-Dade Police Department rules.

In the arrest report, Officer Javier Baez interviewed Freitas, who was very agitated and intoxicated. Freitas stated that she was intoxicated and did not remember striking the officer and did not understand why she was being arrested.

Freitas will be in court next week facing of felony battery on a police officer.

CBS4 attempted to talk to Freitas, but she lives in a gated community in Broward County.

Her attorney would not comment on the clearing of Officer Ross.

The Miami-Dade Police Department Internal Affairs Division did not investigate Ross’ actions as neither Freitas nor anyone else filed a complaint against the veteran officer.-1
http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/11/29/nadia-ezaldein-positively-purple-fundraiser/Family Of Murdered Nordstrom Employee Raising Awareness About Workplace ViolenceCHICAGO (CBS) — For the first time, we are hearing from the family of a young woman who’s murder shocked the city.

Nadia Ezaldein was a University of Chicago student and a seasonal employee at the Nordstrom on Michigan Avenue. On Nov. 28, 2014, Black Friday, Ezaldein was fatally shot inside the luxury department store on her 22nd birthday.

Her ex-boyfriend, Marcus Dee, pulled the trigger, then killed himself.

“Nadia was an incredibly inspiring, intelligent sister of mine. She was very near and dear to all of us,” said Harib, her brother. “I remember the reaction from my sisters, from my parents, and it was a very tragic night.”

Prior to the shooting, Ezaldein told friends Dee had physically abused her.

Today, Harib, a physician, is joining forces with the Center for Domestic Violence Policy in trying to raise awareness about abusers who come to the workplace.

“When you break up with someone, you may move out of the shared residence, so they don’t know where your live anymore. But they know one thing about you — where you work,” said Pam Paziotopoulos, who is the founder of the national organization.

Paziotopoulos says if Nordstrom had known Ezaldein had been abused by her ex-boyfriend, her death could have possibly been prevented.

“And perhaps if she would have divulged it at that time — she could have given a photograph of the abuser — and both security guards at the front of the mall, and the front of Nordstrom, would have had a photograph of that abuser.”

On Thursday, Harib and Paziotopoulos will hold a fundraiser to raise money for domestic violence awareness in honor of Ezaldein, who her brother says is someone “I hope to exemplify in a lot of ways, and something that I hopefully learn from and carry on in my own life.”

The Positively Purple Fundraiser is at Artspace, 900 N. Michigan Avenue, at 7 p.m. Thursday evening. It will benefit the Center for Domestic Violence Policy.

CBS 2 reached out to Nordstrom to see if the store has made any security changes in the three years since Ezaldein’s murder. We haven’t heard back.-1
http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/mark-zuckerbergs-sister-sexually-harassed-on-alaska-airlines-flight/Mark Zuckerberg’s Sister Says She Was Sexually Harassed On Alaska Airlines FlightLOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — The sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg says she was harassed on an Alaska Airlines flight from LA to Mazatlan, and when she complained, flight attendants offered to move her, rather than the harasser.

In a Facebook post, Randi Zuckerberg says a man sitting next to her in first class repeatedly made “explicit, lewd, and highly offensive sexual comments to me.”

“He started talking to me about touching himself, kept asking me if I fantasized about the female business colleague I was traveling with, rated and commented on the women’s bodies boarding the aircraft as they walked by us, and many more equally horrifying and offensive comments,” Zuckerberg wrote in the letter she sent to Alaska Airlines executives.

When she complained, she said flight attendants said the passenger was a frequent flyer with the airline and that while they’ve had to talk to him about his behavior in the past, that Zuckerberg shouldn’t take it personally because he “just doesn’t have a filter.”

When Zuckerberg said she was extremely uncomfortable, the flight attendants suggested she move to a middle seat at the very back of the plane.

“Which I almost did until I realized…why should I have to move? I am the one that is being harassed! By a traveler who has a KNOWN history by these very flight attendants of being inappropriate and offensive in the past,” Zuckerberg said in her letter.

She said all of this transpired before the plane took off, and questioned why the passenger was not thrown off the plane. She further wrote that during the flight, she watched the passenger drink several alcoholic beverages and continue to make inappropriate and offensive comments.

“Ironically one of those comments about all the recent sexual harassment cases in the media and how ‘these Millennial women just aren’t willing to give some booty to get a job anymore.’”

Zuckerberg says Alaska Airlines executives have since called her to say that they are conducting an investigation and have temporarily suspended this passenger’s travel privileges.

“While it should never have happened in the first place, I am thankful that they are taking the situation seriously,” she wrote in her update.-1

(You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here .)

1. Tax overhaul

The GOP effort to remake the nation's tax code was rolling along nicely in the Senate. A final vote was set for last night, and even maverick Sen. John McCain said he was on board . Then, the whole thing hit a trillion dollar-sized pothole. A nonpartisan analysis of the Senate tax bill said yes, it would generate some economic growth, but the massive tax cuts in it would still add $1 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. That flies in the face of White House claims that the tax cuts would pay for themselves.

So, deficit hawks like Bob Corker -- Tennessee senator and Donald Trump nemesis -- demanded some changes. The big vote was delayed until later today , and the tax writers went back to work. Corker wants to find ways to raise more revenue if the tax package indeed doesn't create enough economic growth. So, the GOP is looking at things like gradually raising the corporate rate after the initial tax cut or not completely repealing the alternative minimum tax.

2. Kate Steinle verdict

The debate over immigration policy reignited after a San Francisco jury acquitted an undocumented immigrant in a woman's shooting death. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was found not guilty of murder and involuntary manslaughter in the killing of Kate Steinle . Garcia Zarate had been deported five times and was in the country illegally when he shot and killed Steinle in 2015.

The case became a flashpoint in the debate over immigration because prior to the shooting, San Francisco, under a sanctuary city law , had released Garcia Zarate instead of turning him over to ICE. President Trump, who used the shooting on the campaign trail to make the case for his border wall proposal, called the verdict "disgraceful." Garcia Zarate is set to be deported again.

Reports popped up that the White House was prepping a replacement for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- possible CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Now, we've learned that this public shaming of Tillerson was President Trump's way of expressing displeasure with him, similar to the way he went after Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this year. Some officials expect Tillerson to be gone by the end of the year. So, it seems like a big ole plate of awkward will be on the menu when Trump, Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have lunch together today at the White House.

Japanese Emperor Akihito will step down in 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in 200 years . In a speech last year, Akihito, who is 83, hinted that he wanted to move on, saying his advanced age and his fitness level was making it difficult to carry out his duties. His son, Crown Prince Naruhito, would be the new Emperor.

http://cnn.com/travel/article/india-luxury-hotels/index.html25 of India's most luxurious hotels(CNN) — Old Delhi, Mumbai , Rajasthan, the Himalayas -- India is full of contrasts and layers, diverse landscapes and notoriously hard-to-reach villages.

"The palace hotel experience in Rajasthan, in particular, is something you don't see anywhere else in the world," Jay Tindall, co-founder of ultra-luxury bespoke travel service Remote Lands , tells CNN Travel.

"It's really uniquely India and it tends to be the starting point for luxury travelers. That's a challenge for us as well, because we encourage visitors to get off the beaten track and explore more of the country."

Once you decide which destinations to visit, the next decision is where to stay. From palace hotels to luxury tented camps, these are India's crème de la crème:

Palace hotels

Taj Lake Palace

Set in the middle of Lake Pichola -- in India's storied Udaipur region -- Taj Lake Palace has long been praised as one of the world's most romantic hotels.

It's almost hard to believe your eyes. The white marble marvel appears to float above the water, all the while surrounded by the majestic Aravalli mountains.

"If you want that more-than-250-year-old history, you'll find it at a Taj hotel," says Tindall. "This is where Taj really shines. The service is impeccable, and they are all special properties where you can feel a sense of history at the centuries-old palaces."

It's an opulent experience from start to finish, beginning with a boat ride to the royal island, where guests are immediately welcomed with a shower of rose petals and a welcome drink.

From there, travelers can lounge around in 18th-century splendor -- originally built as a pleasure palace by Maharana Jagat Singh II in 1746 -- dine on authentic Rajasthani cuisine, or book a treatment on the famous spa boat.

Rambagh Palace

Featuring white marble corridors and red brick accents, the Rambagh Palace was used by the Maharajas of Jaipur in various capacities over the years, first as a handmaid's residence then a hunting lodge and finally a royal guesthouse.

Dating to 1835, the palace is not only celebrated for its marvelous architecture but also for the 47 acres of royal gardens where peacocks strut throughout the day.

The hotel offers countless ways to unwind, including two pools, a grand spa, a Polo Bar, boutique shops, and a labyrinth of romantic courtyards.

During the day, guests are invited to take a historical walk about the grounds escorted by a Palace Butler and, by night, the palace's front lawns come alive with performances and music.

"The one thing India really does exceptionally well is service -- it's the entire experience," says Tindall. "From the moment you walk in the door, it's very regal, detail-oriented, personable ... and you just get this sense of colonial-influenced old India."

The commanding Art Deco-styled facade, made of desert sandstone, rises atop a hill at the highest point in Jodhpur, in northwest India.

Taj Falaknuma Palace

The jewel of Hyderabad, Taj Falaknuma Palace captures a gloriously gilded past.

In its past life, the 19th-century palace was the residence of the Nizam of Hyderabad. In fact, Princess Esra, former wife of the current titular Nizam of Hyderabad, worked closely with Taj hotels during the careful renovation process.

The goal was to preserve as much of the original as possible, including everything from leather upholstery to paintings and stucco work.

Sitting atop 32 acres of gardens and courtyards, the hotel is a living museum of murals, Venetian chandeliers, antiques and statues -- plus 60 lavish guest rooms, croquet lawns, labyrinthine gardens and stables.

SUJÁN Rajmahal Palace

Located just outside of Jaipur, SUJÁN Rajmahal Palace is easily one of the most stylish hotels in India.

Decked out in contemporary colors and eye-catching wallpapers, the Relais & Châteaux address hotel adds a modern touch to the otherwise ancient surrounds.

Staying true to its regal identity -- built by Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur for his favorite queen -- the 250-year-old Rajmahal Palace boasts pristine lawns, lofty bay windows, marble staircases and glamorous decor.

If you feel like a celebrity here, you're not too far off the mark -- over the years, the guest list has included Queen Elizabeth II and Jackie Onassis.

A nostalgic outpost in the middle of the golden Thar desert, outside of Jaisalmer, SUJÁN The Serai is a 100-acre oasis set amid dunes and starry night skies, promising memorable dining experiences and musical campfires.

Featuring terrace lounges and locally made textiles, the 21 tented suites are scattered across the dramatic landscape and share a communal tented restaurant, spa and reception area.

The six Luxury Tented Suites come with added perks, such as private stone plunge pools and walled gardens.

Meanwhile, the Royal Tented Suite stands alone as its own abode, complete with a personal butler, outdoor pool and private spa.

SUJÁN JAWAI

In the heart of leopard country, SUJÁN JAWAI provides an enthralling jaunt through ​rural Rajasthan.

"A special place is SUJÁN JAWAI, which our clients always love," says Tindall.

"The accommodations are really nice; the experience is great ... You get to see leopards in a beautiful environment. It's the closest thing to an African safari in Asia."

On the grounds, travelers will find just nine suites and one royal suite, set amid the peaceful landscape.

The design embraces subdued shades of gray and black to create a contemporary atmosphere, combined with bits of retro industrial touches and pops of ​scarlet ​red​ (inspired by the local Rabari tribe​) for energy.

Here, travelers might fill their days with a safari drive or a visit to nearby Bisalpur village, dine by the campfire at night, or enjoy a private picnic in the bush.

On the grounds of the camp, travelers can partake in a variety of activities, including polo, river rafting, picnics, village walks, archery, cycling and trekking.

"I'm very intrigued by what The Ultimate Travelling Camp is doing," says Tindall. "They really brought luxury to that northern part of India, in Ladakh. They have been able to bring travelers to that region whereas, previously that area was really hard to access for foreigners."

"Typically, people stay away from India during the monsoon season, June through August, but actually that's the time to go up to these Ultimate Travelling Camps and visit the mountains. It's the opposite season there."

Just opened earlier this year in the Aravalli mountain range of northern India, the blush-colored Alila Fort Bishangarh was a beast to renovate.

Led by Jaipur's own Sthapatya Architects, the process took nearly 10 years from start to finish due to the building's organic floor plan and 10-foot-thick walls.

Inside the 230-year-old building, find a wonderland of spiral staircases, courtyards, columns and latticed windows.

Tijara Fort-Palace

About a three-hour drive southwest of New Delhi, Tijara Fort-Palace is hard to miss. The grand building sits atop a hill in the middle of a valley.

Originally built by Prince Maharaja Balwant Singh, the fort-palace was left incomplete and abandoned after the ruler's unexpected death in the mid-19th century.

In the 1980s, Neemrana Hotels bought the 19th-century beauty and set to work restoring it.

The result is magnificent -- picture terraced gardens, turrets, courtyards, open-air corridors and imposing Rajput-Afghan-style architecture with carved arched doorways, pillars and domed ceilings.

Each of the 63 rooms and suites has its own heritage character and charm, many of which overlook the fort's gardens and lawns.

Promising continuous views of the Taj Mahal -- just 600 meters away -- The Oberoi Amarvilas is the place to stay in Agra.

It's not an ancient property, by any definition, but the Mughal-style design and gold leaf accents certainly look the part of a royal residence.

It's five minutes from the pedestrianized street leading up to the Taj and the hotel will transfer guests to and from the site by electric buggy (vehicles releasing carbon emissions aren't allowed within 500 meters of the mausoleum).

As you might hope, every room at Amarvilas has a view of the Taj Mahal.

"It's really untouched and unparalleled," says Tindall.

The Lodhi Hotel

Located near the historic Lodi Gardens and Delhi Golf Club in south-central New Delhi, The Lodhi Hotel is the definition of an urban retreat.

"I like the Lodhi because it's more of a modern hotel," says Tindall. "You're going to see the palace, the tented camps and these other old-world type places during a longer India journey. So I enjoy this modern experience in Delhi."

The calm and contemporary hotel is home to 48 rooms and suites -- the largest of which is the Sultan Suite.

This apartment-like setting stretches across 4,500 square feet and boasts its own private plunge pool, kitchenette and balconies.

The rooms aren't the only lure: The Lodhi is known for its excellent Indian-inspired culinary offerings, alfresco courtyards, a spa, 50-meter pool, and tennis and squash courts.

Opened in 1903, the hotel was built by Jamsetji Tata (known as the "father of Indian industry") and has been used to host maharajas, visiting dignitaries and celebrities over the decades.

Located in south Mumbai, the 285-room palace is the epitome of grandeur. There's the luxurious Arabian Sea-view rooms (with marble bathrooms), gold fabrics, grand chandeliers, fine-dining restaurants (including Masala Kraft, serving contemporary Indian cuisine), a harborside bar and sky-high ceilings.

To keep the place running like clockwork, on any given day there will be more than 1,500 staff on duty and at least three dozen butlers.

The Leela Palace New Delhi

From the city's only rooftop infinity pool to the grand reception area, The Leela Palace New Delhi knows how to spoil travelers.

"The Leela Palace is also really lavish," says Tindall. "It's built in the older traditional palace but it's new and fresh."

Opened in 2011, the Palace pays tribute to classic royal residences of old with stately pillars, lush drapes, marble bathrooms, handmade silverware, classic furniture and signature butler service -- not to mention the fleet of Rolls Royce Phantoms and personal shoppers at your disposal.

If you like what you see, the Leela hotel group has several other urban retreats across India, including addresses in Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/01/opinions/china-north-korea-oil-embargo/index.htmlWhy an oil embargo won't stop North KoreaTong Zhao is a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. The views expressed here are solely his.

Beijing (CNN) With North Korea's testing of what appears to be a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), China is under great pressure to impose crippling economic sanctions against Pyongyang, including cutting off its oil supply.

After the most recent UN Security Council resolution over North Korea, China has already pledged to reduced its export of crude oil and oil products to North Korea

However, US President Donald Trump called his Chinese counterpart to say it was time for China to cut off oil supplies to North Korea, the US ambassador to the UN said Wednesday , and on Thursday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said China "could do more with the oil" to help rein in North Korea.

However, completely cutting off the oil supply would be a drastic step.

Time is not on the international community's side in dealing with North Korea. But that is no reason for rushing to take measures without fully assessing their possible impact.

So what effect would an oil supply cut-off have on the security of the United States and other countries in the region? The first issue to consider is its direct impact on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.

JUST WATCHED South Korea's blazing response to new ICBM launch Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH South Korea's blazing response to new ICBM launch 01:07

Oil embargo likely to reinforce Pyongyang's resolve

Detailed and authoritative data about North Korea's oil use across various sectors and its capability to adjust and adapt to a cut-off is scarce. That said, some research suggests that North Korea could cut its non-military use of oil substantially to ensure that the military felt no near-term effects.

Another study shows that North Korea has also obtained the technology to replace oil with other indigenous sources of hydrocarbons. Moreover, given that the military probably possesses significant stockpiles of oil, and that the nuclear and missile programs appear to be prioritized over everything else, it is unlikely that an oil cut-off would have any quick impact on these programs.

Furthermore, oil supply is not a significant constraint on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. As North Korea sprints to complete the development of a credible nuclear deterrent capability, it has long passed the stage when it can be contained by fuel embargo. As a result, an oil cut-off is more likely to reinforce Pyongyang's political resolve to acquire nuclear weapons than to dampen it.

Some proponents of an oil embargo might acknowledge these problems, but still support it because of its potential to destabilize the regime -- which raises the second question: If an oil embargo does bring about regime instability or even regime collapse, are we ready to deal with the consequences?

JUST WATCHED North Korean defection caught on camera Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH North Korean defection caught on camera 01:32

Back down or double down?

An oil embargo may be able to undermine North Korea's economic system and therefore create regime instability. But the impact will not be immediate. As the consequences of an oil cut-off are felt -- and we don't know exactly how long this could take -- the regime will become increasingly desperate.

Perhaps it will choose to back down. It may, however, choose to behave even more provocatively and aggressively, taking brinksmanship to the extreme in the hope of winning a dangerous competition of risk-taking. Given North Korea's political ideology, there is ample reason to suspect that this outcome is the most likely.

A more aggressive North Korean regime could further threaten South Korea, Japan, Guam, and even the US homeland.

Faced with regime collapse its threats -- such as firing missiles toward waters near Guam -- would become increasingly credible. Is the United States confident that it could win this game of chicken without initiating a nuclear war?

From the North Korean perspective, an oil embargo that could threaten the stability of the regime contradicts the US official policy of not pursuing regime change.

If Pyongyang becomes convinced of Washington's intent to challenge its rule, it could be even more defiant and less incentivized to come to the negotiating table.

The United States, China, and other regional countries have homework to do in thinking through these challenges and achieving some basic common understandings before implementing an oil embargo.

Time to talk

In the meantime, they should pursue two urgent goals. The first is to stop North Korea from further improving its capabilities. In its official statement after the recent ICBM test, Pyongyang declared the completion of its missile development program, implying that no more flight tests are needed.

If North Korea indeed intends to stop future missile tests, it essentially renounces the option of building better missiles such as solid-fueled ICBMs and missiles with multiple warheads that can be more survivable and more threatening. The significance of such a commitment should not be underestimated.

It is time for the international community to be responsive and to reciprocate this possible signal of self-restraint with at least an effort to seek further clarification from Pyongyang about its intentions.

If talking to North Korea can lead to negotiations that freeze its capabilities, this would take the pressure off the international community from quickly implementing an oil embargo that might later be regretted.

The second step is to seriously pursue risk reduction measures. Setting up a direct hot line between Washington and Pyongyang and exchanging high-level envoys -- either publicly or privately -- are some useful measures to take.

The ongoing game of risk-taking between Pyongyang and Washington has entered a very dangerous stage. The risk of misjudgment and miscalculation is increasingly real and the result could be an unintended nuclear conflict. Containing this crisis is now as important as containing North Korea's nuclear advancement.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/africa/au-eu-summit-ivory-coast/index.htmlMerkel, Macron meet African leaders for summit(CNN) Leaders are gathering in Ivory Coast on Wednesday for an African Union-European Union summit intended to boost relations between the continents at a time when concerns over migration, security and opportunities for young people are at the fore.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the European leaders who will sit down with their African counterparts for the two-day summit in the capital, Abidjan.

The issue of human slave auctions in Libya is expected to be on the agenda, following recent reporting by CNN which revealed African migrants being sold as slaves in the capital, Tripoli, and elsewhere.

European Parliament President Antonio Tajani called in a speech Tuesday in Abidjan for the summit to "give fresh impetus to our relations," with a focus on investment in job creation and infrastructure to help manage an impending population explosion in Africa.

"Everything we do must focus on young people," said Tajani, as he warned that Europe risked being sidelined if it did not step up to the challenge. "This is of fundamental importance, as there is a danger of our relationship being shunted into the background by other players such as China and Turkey."

http://cnn.com/2017/12/01/health/men-behaving-badly/index.htmlReconciling love and admiration for men who behave badlyGuthrie read a statement from NBC News Chairman Andy Lack that cited "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace" as the reason for his termination.

"All we can say is that we are heartbroken," Guthrie said on air. "I am heartbroken for Matt. He is my dear, dear friend and my partner, and he is beloved by many, many people here. And I'm heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own stories to tell.

"We are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks. How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? And I don't know the answer to that."

Hoda Kotb, sitting alongside Guthrie at the anchor desk, said on air, "I've known Matt for 15 years, and I've loved him as a friend and as a colleague. And again, just like you were saying, Savannah, it's hard to reconcile what we're hearing with the man who we know, who walks in this building every single day."

In the cases of Lauer, Harvey Weinstein and dozens of other powerful men now accused of sexual misconduct, their accusers, their friends and the general public are struggling to reconcile two sides of people they once admired and may still even care for.

The terminology some women once used to describe these men included hero, mentor, champion, idol. Now, they don't know what to call them.

'Can you love someone who did bad things?'

"This recent calling out of sexual assault has been a long time coming," Silverman said on the show. "It's good. It's like cutting out tumors. It's messy, and it's complicated, and it's going to hurt, but it's necessary, and we'll all be healthier for it. And it sucks, and some of our heroes will be taken down, and we will discover bad things about people we like or -- in some cases -- people we love.

"It's a real mindf**k, because I love Louis, but Louis did these things. ... So, I just keep asking myself, 'Can you love someone who did bad things? Can you still love them?' "

It's a question many people across the country are asking in light of recent revelations.

"Of course you can still love people who do bad things," psychiatrist Gail Saltz said. "It doesn't make you a bad person that you love them, but it (also) doesn't mean that it's OK for you to give them a job and a pass and a 'That's OK, keep going about doing your crime.'

"On a societal level, we have to have rules, and rules when broken have to have punishments, or we don't have a civilized society," Saltz added. "To some degree, these things have happened so ubiquitously because there have not been ramifications because ... the system has been broken."

Psychologist Jeff Gardere said, "What I see with Sarah Silverman and many people that I've talked to, they actually go through a grieving process, because in many ways they feel like they have placed their love and their trust in someone who wasn't really 'real' to begin with."

How to reconcile multiple truths

JUST WATCHED How journalists covered colleagues' harassment scandals Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How journalists covered colleagues' harassment scandals 01:26

Guthrie, Silverman and numerous others are painstakingly processing how someone they trusted, respected and thought they knew could do these until-now-unspeakable things to their vulnerable colleagues.

And this dilemma is not just about public figures. Claims of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior happen in companies of all sizes.

So, what do you do if someone you know and care about -- a good friend or family member -- is accused of wrongdoing?

"If it's really horrendous and traumatic, sometimes what goes on is a dissociation and compartmentalization in an extreme way," Saltz said. "In other words, not letting your mind know of the bad stuff when you need to be feeling the good stuff. And denial can be incredibly powerful, to the point of symptoms like depersonalization. Kids who have been through a trauma literally do not feel present in their bodies when the bad things are going on."

At the other end of the spectrum, Saltz said, is a realization that this person you like or even love has been good to you in some ways but not in others.

"People are very complex, and throughout history, there have been people who have done good things and who have presented themselves in particular ways, but yet they have a dark side," Gardere said. "Depending on what it is that they've done and how dark that side is, does that dark side completely overshadow the rest of their lives?"

Saltz, who is also the author of " Anatomy of a Secret Life ," said that sometimes the inclination to act out is balanced out by guilt, shame and regret.

The result, she said, is something called "splitting," which happens when "people who have had urges to do some very bad things, rather than allow themselves to really think about that or process that ... they compartmentalize it and in fact deny it vigorously in their head by doing the opposite."

When it comes to reconciling your own feelings, Saltz recommends trying to be "aware of it all" at the same time: allowing yourself to feel the conflict and ambivalence about the person who let you down.

"That's what's so hard for people: to be ambivalent," she said. "Everyone wants it to be black or white. It's more comfortable. It's less anxiety-producing." On the other hand, "it's more anxiety-producing to go, 'I love you, but I don't like you ... and in some ways that makes you not a good person to me.' "

The risks of role models

For the close friends and families of Lauer and Louis C.K., the challenge of reconciling conflicting feelings is undeniable. But even for people who have admired a public figure from a distance, it can be difficult to come to terms with negative revelations.

"I don't do role models; I do inspirations," Jessie J replied. "I used to be proud to be a role model, and I'm not anymore, because people put you in a box. And as soon as you break it, they're disappointed in you. ... There is no one in this world that can do everything that you want them to do. It's impossible."

Instead, the pop star said she draws inspiration from her family, her friends -- even patients she's met through her work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation

"Just people on the street that I watch; people on my team that I've seen get through things that I don't know how they could," she said. "Artists like Lauryn Hill, Nina Simone, Whitney Houston -- and people going, 'Oh, what inspired you?' And I'm like, 'Just moments. Just little things that they did that maybe I'm not ready to do yet, but I could do it because they do it.' "

"Insightful" is how Saltz described Jessie J's point of view.

"We all have strengths and weaknesses," Saltz said. "It's human nature to idolize and have this role model idea that everything is great and perfect. It may be a human wish and desire, but nobody is all-everything."

Gardere, who is also an assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Touro College , said this is a lesson we should have learned a long time ago. "We are so invested in what we see as far as appearances -- especially people in the media or political figures -- that we buy in lock, stock and barrel that these are our heroes, these are our leaders, these are our mentors, these are our idols," he said. "I think we're learning that the reality is, you just can't embrace someone based on one aspect of their lives.

"With TV, movies or what have you, you can admire a character a person plays, but don't blend the lines in thinking ... the persona they give on TV is necessarily who they are in real life," he said.

"I think looking up to aspects is, in a way, healthier," Saltz said. "Or, you can have a role model, but understand that a role model is not a perfect person, because there is no such thing."0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/health/flying-eye-hospital-global-cameroon/index.htmlFixing the world's vision using a hospital with wings(CNN) It's early morning in Cameroon's capital city of Yaoundé. A bus bumps along city roads, carrying doctors and nurses from around the world, including the United States, India and South Africa.

They arrive at Yaoundé's airport, walk across the tarmac and board a plane -- but they won't be going anywhere.

Instead, they scrub in for surgery and begin a day of operations aboard a fully equipped hospital that just happens to have wings. It's known as the Flying Eye Hospital.

The airplane is an MD-10 that once belonged to shipping company FedEx. The company donated the plane to Orbis, a nonprofit organization that aims to promote eye health around the world.

This plane is Orbis' third, taking over as the Flying Eye Hospital last year. It travels on missions anywhere it's needed and is almost completely self-contained. It carries all necessary supplies, runs off its own power generators and produces its own hospital-grade oxygen.

The only things the plane needs are water, aviation fuel and a runway large enough to land it.

First mission: surgery

For this particular trip, the Flying Eye Hospital spent four weeks in Cameroon, a country with a high need for ophthalmologists: doctors specializing in the eye.

According to Orbis, Cameroon has only 73 registered ophthalmologists for a population of roughly 24 million people. That means only one eye doctor for every 329,000 Cameroonians.

Serge Tchakounte, 40, was one of those patients in need of care.

Serge Tchakounte, 40, injured his eye in a motorbike accident.

He was injured in a motorbike accident in February. He is unable to remember much about the accident, as it knocked him out cold, but when he woke up, Tchakounte had a facial fracture in the orbital bones around his left eye.

"It impacted my sight in the sense that I cannot see well backward, up, down and to the sides," he said. "When I try to look up, I see the image double, even from backward and the sides."

Over time, without the bone to lift and stabilize it, Tchakounte's eye has sunk. His doctor knew that Orbis was planning to return to Cameroon in November for the organization's third trip to the country and referred Tchakounte to the program.

When Tchakounte arrived at Yaoundé Central Hospital for a consultation with the Orbis doctors, he met Dr. Thomas Johnson, a longtime volunteer and specialist in ocular plastic surgery at the University of Miami's Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Florida. This was Johnson's 12th mission with Orbis.

"I think you need to be very flexible," Johnson said. "You're traveling to a different country, working with different people that you haven't worked with before, in different operating rooms and with different equipment, so you have to be very flexible (and) be able to improvise."

Second mission: teaching

Orbis' main mission is to teach, so the Flying Eye Hospital is first and foremost a teaching hospital. That means its priority isn't necessarily seeing as many patients as possible but seeing patients who represent a variety of cases. For a diverse specialty like ocular plastics, Johnson planned to do several types of operations over the course of the week.

"We're trying to show a variety of different techniques in a limited amount of time, so I think that's the most difficult part," Johnson said. "We can't really do surgery on every single patient."

Johnson and his colleagues planned to train local Cameroonian doctors, both on the plane and at the central hospital.

The Orbis plane, fully fitted with hospital equipment.

The plane itself is equipped with training simulators and cameras in the operating room. At the front, rows of airplane seats face a television monitor where trainees can watch live surgeries and ask questions.

In Cameroon, a medical translator spoke French, the country's national language, and provided real-time translation.

"The Flying Eye Hospital is sort of a United Nations," said Dr. Jonathan Lord, global medical director for Orbis. "We have, I think on this program, about 19 different nationalities."

Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

The Flying Eye Hospital isn't the only mobile hospital undertaking missions around the world. Large ships like the US Navy's USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy are deployed both on humanitarian missions and to assist after natural disasters, such as the Haiti earthquake in 2010.

"With the opportunity to do long-term training and capacity building and not simply short-term surgery, these platforms can provide sustainable development in global health," said Dr. Mark Shrime, research director for Harvard Medical School's program in global surgery and social change. He is not involved in any Orbis projects.

"Because these platforms tend to be self-contained, they are less reliant on local infrastructure, which means they can sometimes do more complex procedures," he said.

However, Shrime added, "on a day-to-day basis, these platforms can be expensive. With something like Orbis, they also require an airport able to accommodate a plane."

Curable conditions

According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 253 million people have vision impairment worldwide, of which 80% can be prevented or cured. The key is awareness and early detection, whether it is cataracts -- a clouding of the eye -- or glaucoma, a pressure on the nerve of the eye.

Both are very common in Cameroon and globally.

"There are over 500,000 people here in Cameroon who are either blind or have low vision," Lord said. "75 percent of them, 375,000 people, have treatable disease."

For Tchakounte, who had the facial fracture, surgery to repair it meant the chance to work again. He helps animals as a veterinary technician and hadn't been able to work since the accident because he couldn't see to drive a motorbike.

Serge Tchakounte prepares for surgery on board the plane.

As the surgical team prepped Tchakounte, he was confident about the outcome.

"To have my eye as before the accident, if I can see without problem, I can drive again, it would be nice," he said.

In the airplane's operating room, Johnson placed an implant in the orbital floor to lift Tchakounte's eye, aligning it with his right eye. That was expected to correct the double vision.

After an hour and a half, the surgery was over. Tchakounte was wheeled out of the operating room and into the recovery room.

The only sign that the surgery took place on an airplane was the reflection of the plane windows on the glass lining the operating room.2
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/health/antibiotic-resistance-historical-study/index.htmlAntibiotic resistance: Old problem, new ramifications(CNN) A post-antibiotic era is hardly an "apocalyptic fantasy," the World Health Organization has said . The idea that key antibiotics could be rendered useless against even minor infections "is instead a very real possibility for the 21st century."

But the problem goes back much further.

Researchers in France recently looked at historical samples of one salmonella strain dating back as far as 1911. What they found: The genes that make these bacteria resistant to a drug called ampicillin emerged before that antibiotic even went on sale in 1961.

The researchers say this is probably due to another antibiotic that was used in low doses to promote growth in farm animals. That antibiotic, penicillin G, which was widely added to livestock feed in the '50s and '60s.

"It's a different story, then. It's not due to the clinical use of ampicillin" in humans, said Dr. François-Xavier Weill, head of the Enteric Bacterial Pathogens Unit at the Pasteur Institute. Weill published these findings Wednesday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases.

The idea that one antibiotic can provoke resistance to another is not a new concept, according to Dr. Jim Hughes, professor of medicine and public health at Emory University. The genes that protect bacteria from our drugs can even hop across species, riding on circular loops of DNA called plasmids. Plasmids are often loaded with multiple resistance genes.

Antibiotic resistance goes back further still. Some genes have even been found in caves that were thought to be isolated for millions of years. But it is modern medicine, experts say, that is responsible for hastening the evolution and spread of resistance at alarming rates.

While researchers have been sounding the alarm for decades, "finally over the last couple of years, it's been getting the attention that has been long overdue and that it richly deserves," said Hughes, who is also a co-director of the Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center. He was not involved in the new study.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 2 million Americans contract antibiotic-resistant infections every year and that 23,000 die as a result.

than those in which first-line antibiotics work, the And these infections are often longer, more costly and more seriousthan those in which first-line antibiotics work, the CDC says.

"It's clearly a problem that's getting worse," Hughes said.

A Nobel cause

Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, warned of antibiotic resistance at his Nobel lecture in 1945.

"The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops," he said. "Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and, by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug, make them resistant."

In fact, penicillin-resistant bacteria had been identified in 1940, years before Fleming gave his speech, according to the CDC.

Fortunately, in the mid- to late 1900s, "the pipeline was full of new antibiotics" in development, Weill said.

antibiotics were being developed as of May for potential use in humans, according to But these days, we're not keeping pace: Fifty-oneantibiotics were being developed as of May for potential use in humans, according to a report by the World Health Organization.

Just 33 of these target "priority pathogens": families of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health. Only eight are innovative treatments, and the other 25 modify existing antibiotics and are short-term solutions at best, according to the WHO.

Experts say the great majority of these drugs will never make it through clinical trials to treat infections in humans. For this reason, prevention is seen as key.

Otherwise, heavily resistant bacteria, some colloquially known as "superbugs," may threaten both our health and our wallets.

"More resistant infections don't just mean you or someone you care about is more likely to die from one; they also mean health care will get even more expensive," Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, previously told CNN. "Many of the procedures we take for granted in medicine, from cancer treatments to surgeries, depend on our ability to handle infections that happen in the course of treatment."

Off the farm

Penicillin is not available over the counter in the US, as Fleming feared, but patients who skip doses and doctors who incorrectly prescribe antibiotics -- say, for the common cold -- may be adding to the threat of resistance, the CDC says.

Similarly, when animals get antibiotics, often in their food or drinking water, the drugs may kill a number of bacteria. But a handful might harbor a gene that makes them resistant to drugs. Those bacteria may survive, multiply and spread.

These bugs "can move off of farms ... and find their way into communities," Lena Brook, a food policy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, previously told CNN.

For Hughes, the new study "highlights the importance of monitoring the impact of the recent FDA action on this ."

By January, animal drug manufacturers no longer allowed medically important antibiotics, which are used in humans, to be prescribed solely for growth purposes, according to the FDA. But this left open the possibility that these drugs could be used to routinely prevent disease, even if no animals were sick, so long as a veterinarian had written a prescription.

This drew criticism that the FDA's efforts didn't go far enough. Some have described this as a "giant loophole."

The new study also reinforces the possibility that antibiotics used among livestock can still exert evolutionary pressure on similar antibiotics that are important for humans, Hughes said.

While a number of experts criticize the routine use of antibiotics, others defend the practice, saying that antibiotics play an important role in maintaining animal health and may prevent an entire herd of sick animals that require these drugs down the line.

"While the FDA believes the prevention use of antimicrobials in animal agriculture can play an important role in effectively managing animal disease, it is critical that such use be judicious," the agency previously said in a statement.

Hughes said that, in the wake of the FDA regulations, "it's going to be important as best can be done to monitor changes in antibiotic usage now and ... antibiotic resistance in food animals."

"Companies are not that forthcoming with their use of antibiotics in food animals," he added. "There's not a lot of transparency."-1

http://cnn.com/2017/12/01/sport/kodokan-institute-noaki-murata-jigoro-kano-tokyo-2020/index.htmlJudo: Inside the world's most spiritual sportTokyo, Japan (CNN) In an unassuming Tokyo tower block sits the headquarters of a sport at a spiritual crossroads.

A stone's throw from the Japanese capital's space age domed baseball stadium, and in the shadow of a nearby theme park's roller coaster, is the Kodokan International Judo Center.

From the lobby, it appears like any of Tokyo's countless high-rise buildings. A sign for a café in the basement and a small merchandise stand offer little hint of what's above.

But an elevator ride to the second floor reveals the home of a sport with competitive and philosophical roots stretching back over 130 years.

It's this floor that is home to the Kodokan's library and museum, where writings and images from judo's history are displayed in glass cabinets to be studied and revered.

The curator of this collection is Noaki Murata, someone who has built his life around judo and who cherishes the values first preached by its founder Jigoro Kano in 1882.

"The ultimate goal is to put inside our mind two principles," explains Murata, who -- despite his 68 years -- boasts broad shoulders and a strong posture that speak to his past athletic prowess.

"The principle of maximum efficiency and the principle of mutual welfare and benefit, that's the spirit of judo."

The Kodokan is an eight-storey training mecca for aspiring and elite-level judokas willing to eat, sleep and breathe the sport. While not exactly modern, every inch of the building is pristine.

Spread between the fourth and sixth floors are male and female dojos, while the hostel on the third provides accommodation.

The eighth is home to a fully-equipped gymnasium, where large windows allow sunlight to pour over the wooden spectator seats and the blue and red judo mats. The Kodokan boasts over 1,100 such mats.

Vladimir Putin and Shinzo Abe attended a demonstration at the Kodokan in 2016.

It's easy to see how an athlete can improve their strength and technique in such a place, but judo is about more than physical prowess.

What sets it apart from other sports, Murata believes, is its broader goal of self-improvement.

"We could take only the physical aspect of judo, it could be a competitive sport with some rules," he explains in deep, considered tones. "This is why judo can be a competitive sport in the Olympics.

"But we don't say this is fully judo, this is a part of judo. What is judo? I think something more spiritual."

And Murata is certainly someone who has founder deeper meaning and purpose through the sport.

A promising tennis player during his junior high school years in Tokyo, and a strong sumo wrestler, Murata was drawn to judo when he saw his friends practicing in the sports hall.

He joined a local club and, after a couple of months of training, was able to defeat his friends in a judo tournament organized by local schools.

Spurred on by this early success, Murata eventually put down his tennis racket and wholeheartedly pursued "the Gentle Way."

As a young man, he enjoyed how judo enhanced his natural strength. He aspired to be like Isao Inokuma -- a heavyweight gold medalist during the sport's first Olympic appearance at the Tokyo Games of 1964.

His dedication to the sport saw him advance to the elite level of eighth dan and led to his appointment at the Kodokan. The institute has sent him on coaching missions all over the world, including numerous stints as an instructor in Europe.

The eighth-floor gymnasium at the Kodokan.

As well as increasing his strength and broadening his horizons, Murata credits judo with making him a more thoughtful person.

"Think and do, think and do." That's his mantra and something he repeats over and over again. To him, it perfectly illustrates how to succeed in judo and in life.

Make a plan. Execute. Make a new plan.

"I became a person who took time to think deeper than before judo," he explains. "Thinking how I should be better.

"When I don't succeed, I should consider again. Your personality changes ... and I'm very happy because of that. And still I keep the same idea. More active. More active. More active."

And it is the positive actions of dedicated individuals like Morata that have made judo a truly global sport.

A record 389 competitors from 136 countries qualified for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, while figures from 2014 claim there are 28 millions judo practitioners around the world with eight million in Japan alone.

This global expansion has created judokas all over the world, with judo's inclusion in the Olympic program allowing youngsters to dream of winning sport's ultimate prize.

But while judokas of Murata's generation saw judo as both a sport and a way of life, the prospect of a gold medal and wider competitive success is now the overriding motivation for up and coming athletes.

"This is not bad," Murata insists. "But I think Jigoro Kano would be feeling very sad if all Japanese think of judo as a sport only."

The current custodians of Japanese judo are only too aware of the importance of success on the mat when the world championships and the Olympic Games arrive on Japanese soil in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

Kosei Inoue was an Olympic champion in 2000 as well as a three-time world champion between 1999 and 2003.

Now he is head coach of the Japanese men's team and responsible for maintaining his country's formidable record in global competition. Japan took home 12 judo medals from Rio, seven more than any other country.

"I believe that the more you win, the more you have to lose," Inoue told CNN at the 2017 World Championships in Budapest, where Japan dominated the medal table with eight golds.

"Japan has many good practitioners, but their journeys are just beginning.

"It is one thing to win just once, and quite another to continue winning. Fortunately, there is a very good environment for judo in Japan; there are many judokas coming up from high school and universities, so there is a surplus of very skilled and talented athletes.

"As for the 'golden generation' of Japanese judo, we will do everything in our power to make sure they are ready to perform at Tokyo 2020, but the process doesn't end there.

"Coaches, athletes and the All Japan Judo Federation will work together to win all competitions."

As part of the organizing committee for the Tokyo 2020 Games, Yasuhiro Yamashita is a Japanese Olympic legend banking on the current generation emulating his success.

And while both he and Inoue are keen to stress the importance of Jigoro Kano's teachings, the soul of judo may have to take a backseat while the pursuit of golden glory is placed center stage in the coming years.

"As a child, I watched Judo competition at the 1964 Tokyo Games on TV and I was deeply moved by their performances," says Yamashita, who claimed a gold medal at the 1984 Olympic Games and is a bona fide sporting icon in his homeland.

"I dreamed of stepping on top of the podium and singing the Japanese anthem. It was my lifelong goal -- realizing my dream at the Olympic games in Los Angeles was a very emotional moment."

"I fully trust Mr. Inoue as men's head coach and Mr. Masuchi as women's head coach to lead the team to a great success," he adds.

"Also, I sincerely wish that their performances will give the Japanese citizens hopes and dreams. As the President of the All Japan Judo Federation I will do everything in my power to have Japan host spectacular events in 2019 and 2020."

And while Inoue and Yamashita drive Japan's competitive ambitions, people like Murata make sure its soul is protected.

According to him, as judokas age and are forced to step away from top-level competition, they are able to embrace the sport's spiritual side.

And it is through the words and actions of coaches and former competitors that the deeper meaning of the sport is kept alive in young enthusiasts.

Reflecting on the relatively brief career of a sportsperson, Morata says: "The time not being an athlete is a lot longer than the time being an athlete."

And it is this second career that he embraces; an opportunity to keep alive the teachings of Jigoro Kano.

"That is the time for me to give them the true meaning of judo," he adds.

"I show them myself, I show myself to be a good man, showing the spirit of judo."0

Washington (CNN) NFL players will wear cleats during games this weekend to highlight groups and causes important to them like Shriners Hospitals and Lupus awareness as part of the league's My Cause My Cleats initiative. Tennessee Titans wide receiver Rishard Matthews posted on Instagram that his cleats are in support of Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp campaign.

"He has paid the ultimate sacrifice in order to bring true everyday issues to light," Matthews wrote on Instagram about Kaepernick.

After President Trump's September comments about players who kneel during the anthem, Matthews, whose brother, a former Marine, died in Afghanistan while working as a defense contractor, told ESPN he planned to kneel during the anthem until Trump apologized.

"To keep it honest, he was calling a lot of us, and I feel that he was calling myself, an S.O.B., and that's not OK and very disrespectful," he said. "So I plan to kneel until the president apologizes."

The design on the cleats Matthews will wear was done by SoulsbySir, who made other custom cleats for NFL players for the weekend, including for Pittsburgh Steelers' TJ Watt , the Titans' Logan Ryan , and several members of the Baltimore Ravens

http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/opinions/strongmen-riding-high-and-heading-for-fall-ben-ghiat/index.htmlStrongmen are riding high -- and headed for a fallRuth Ben-Ghiat is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion and a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who writes about authoritarianism and propaganda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin bares his chest for pinup calendars, restricts abortion rights and depicts the home as the best place for women. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose personality cult emphasizes his athleticism as a former semi-professional soccer player, has called women who work outside the home "half persons," and equated the use of birth control with treason.

Even Silvio Berlusconi, who boasted of his high libido and publicly and daily demeaned women while serving as Italian Prime Minister, brought up his proficiency at foreplay (and the sex advice he gave to Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi) while announcing a potential political comeback -- at 81, with his 31-year-old fiancée by his side.

President Donald Trump's own authoritarian inclinations come through clearly in his disposition toward women, starting with the notion that consent is for the weak, which has a parallel in politics. Real men don't sit around and debate things, or compromise: They follow their instincts and take action.

Trump's maxim -- describing his assaultive approach to women in the infamous "Access Hollywood" video, "When you're a star, they let you do it" -- has guided his attempts at executive overreach in the political and sexual realms. And he's been open about his frustrations with our press, judiciary and Congress for hampering his manly right to get his own way.

Strongmen know how effective intimidation can be when they're consolidating their power, and many have advertised their own capacity for and/or proximity to political and sexual violence. Trump, during the campaign, warned Americans that he considers himself above the law, whether it's shooting someone on Fifth Avenue, grabbing a woman's genitals, or dropping hints that "Second Amendment people" could do something about his political opponent Hillary Clinton.

This is why Trump hasn't hesitated on Twitter to call attention to sexual harassment accusations -- when they concern Democrats -- despite the many allegations that he has engaged in the same behavior.

In fact, in classic strongman mode, he's been unrepentant and even boastful about his treatment of women, which spans practically the entire spectrum of male aggression to women, from alleged domestic violence (his alleged treatment of his first wife, Ivana), to physical advances and assaults on women, to everyday verbal humiliations and physical shadowing . This last menacing technique, which is common in the workplace, proclaims the man's right to trespass personal boundaries and is designed to put the other person in a state of unease and subjection.

The most monumental thing to happen in omak. A penis in the sky pic.twitter.com/SM8k1tNYaj — Anahi Torres (@anahi_torres_) November 16, 2017

Millions of Americans watched Trump standing behind Clinton during one of their presidential debates -- the camera capturing him at his podium at such an angle to give the appearance of shadowing, and striking a chord for women. But this scene came with a diabolical twist: Trump's comments about groping women, caught on tape, had gone public just two days before, letting Clinton (and viewers) know what he was capable of doing to women in private. I'm right behind you, American women, the TV tableau read that night. Just wait until I'm President. I'll be coming after all of you.

Yet something historic is happening in America today that rebukes such misogynist scenarios. Women are coming after their aggressors, calling them by name and deed and reversing the power equation. The timely apparition of the giant male organ in the sky may also be read as a cry for help from a certain kind of white man: "We were all-powerful. Now what will happen to us?"

The lists of influential men who have been fired, and the cable news screens filled with their faces -- and those of their female victims -- must strike fear into the many who have engaged in such behavior but have not yet had their reckoning.

Once strongmen consolidate their power, it is almost impossible to hold them personally accountable for their actions. This only underscores the preciousness of American democracy, and every time a new abuser is unmasked we're reminded of the power of our freedoms of speech and judicial action.

Even Trump has been unable to intimidate women from eventually coming forth to denounce him, and he and his GOP allies will not succeed in reversing the social shift toward recognizing women's personal and professional autonomy and integrity.

Tough times lie ahead globally for democracy, but Americans have a chance to be beacons for others in dealing with the sexual harassment of both men and women. In the process, we can perhaps begin to heal the divisions of race, class and place that Trump so ably exploited to come to power. We can show the world we value what the strongman most fears and seeks to repress: compassion, justice and our common humanity.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/11/30/opinions/tillerson-pompeo-cotton-trump-miller-sokolsky-opinion/index.htmlTillerson doesn't deserve thisAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of "The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President." Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Follow him @aarondmiller2 . Richard Sokolsky is a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . From 2005-2015, he was a member of the secretary of state's Office of Policy Planning. The views expressed in this commentary are their own.

(CNN) Today, multiple news outlets reported that according to administration sources a tentative plan for a double switch was in the works: CIA Director Mike Pompeo would replace Rex Tillerson at the State Department and Sen. Tom Cotton would replace Pompeo at CIA.

Meanwhile, the White House insists that it's business as usual and there's no immediate plan to replace Secretary Tillerson.

Either this was serious miscommunication (dare we say fake news?) or a mighty strong signal by the administration to Tillerson that there's no longer room for him at the inn.

The logic of the latter would be this: Like Attorney General Sessions, Trump won't fire Tillerson; instead he wants an immaculate resignation. With a source now telling CNN that this was an elaborate public shaming of Tillerson, it's also safe to say that the White House is behaving shamefully. Whatever the President thinks of Tillerson, he doesn't deserve to be treated this way.

We can't predict if/when the sad saga of Rex Tillerson's tenure as secretary of state is coming to an end. But we can weigh in on the impact, should the double switch become reality.

Tillerson was from the beginning a decent man caught in an impossible situation . But he played a bad hand badly. Sure, the President never empowered him to do his job. Trump's twitter tantrums undercut Tillerson's diplomacy on many occasions; he gave large chunks of traditional foreign policy turf to White House underlings and demanded large cuts in the State Department's budget and personnel; and he left a trail of embarrassing foreign policy pronouncements in his wake that Tillerson (and others) had to clean up.

But in focusing on reform that turned unpopular quickly; keeping far too low a public profile and tolerating others like Nikki Haley expounding on foreign policy, Tillerson reduced his own prestige and relevance.

Pompeo is closer to the President personally and on matters of policy. But it's far from clear that he will have any more success navigating the fraught line between a between a cruel and unforgiving world of unresolvable problems on one hand and a President with little regard for diplomacy or the State Department and no coherent process of formulating US foreign policy on the other hand.

Here are some quick takeaways to keep in mind, should Pompeo take over Tillerson's post.

The railroad will run more smoothly

There's little doubt that most of the broken crockery that undermined the Trump-Tillerson relationship will disappear should Pompeo actually replace Tillerson at State. Trump loves military men and admires big success even more. He often introduces Pompeo as a guy who graduated at the top of his class at West Point and attended Harvard Law School.

Being well-liked and respected by a President is rule number one for any successful secretary of state, and given the premium this President seems to put on loyalty, Pompeo checks that box, too. He's rarely disagreed with the President publicly and was quick to defend his statements in the wake of Charlottesville.

Pompeo has taken a different view on Russian meddling in US elections than Trump . But, given the evidence, who hasn't? And it's inconceivable given the CIA role in monitoring these matters, that Pompeo could have adopted any other view. Bottom line: there are likely to be few head-exploding moments with the President openly contradicting his secretary of state if Pompeo is in charge.

Policy mind meld

Pompeo may also have a smoother relationship with Trump because they are more in sync on many policy issues. Both have taken hard line positions on the Iran nuclear agreement, jihadi terror, immigration and travel bans. Add the possibility that Cotton -- a fellow hardliner on Iran -- will go to CIA in Pompeo's job and you'll have a solid wall of opposition within the administration to sticking with the Iran deal.

That would leave Secretary of Defense Mattis -- a relative pragmatist on the Iran deal -- more isolated. The same is true for North Korea, where Pompeo and Trump have expressed skepticism of any diplomatic option and have pushed for more pressure on Kim Jung Un.

With the addition of Cotton, there will be a drastic reduction to any diplomatic counterweight to the President's hawkishness.

Reform is out, but is the State Department in?

With his congressional tea party background, Pompeo likely shares Tillerson's and Trump's penchant to cut State's budget and personnel. Given Tillerson's travails in deconstructing the State Department, Pompeo isn't likely to make reform his central issue. But Pompeo also knows where the President's head seems to be when it comes to State -- immortalized in his comment that he's the only person who matters

How eager he will be to champion the department on budgetary issues or to fight for a more central role for State in the formation of US foreign policy is far from clear.

If he's smart, given the challenges he's facing abroad, he will seek to mobilize the department's expertise, rather than treat it with disdain. Indeed, at CIA he worked hard to reduce friction with the White House --and maybe he can do the same at State.

It's a cruel world

To be a successful secretary of state you need three qualities: the support of the president; good negotiating skills and a world that offers up some opportunity for success. Pompeo has the first; we don't know about the second. But it's fairly clear that he faces long odds in the third category.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

The US confronts an international environment that doesn't offer up quick and easy solutions on some issues. (See North Korea.) It doesn't matter how brilliant or plugged in you are as secretary of state; unless there are deals that can actually be made, you have very little chance of being truly consequential.

Managing and containing Putin, fixing Syria, combatting jihadi terror and stopping North Korean nukes are the long odds issues that will frame Pompeo's world. Pompeo may be closer to Trump than Tillerson. But he would still be dealing with an unpredictable, uncontrollable and idiosyncratic President who does what he wants when he wants and doesn't have much regard or respect for the diplomatic mission of the department Pompeo will be running.

Having spent decades at the State Department, we know how hard it is to get anything done. We wished Tillerson good luck when he started and for the good of the republic we wish Pompeo the same. He's going to need it.0
http://cnn.com/2017/11/29/opinions/gop-tax-plan-women-families-rowe-finkbeiner-opinion/index.htmlOn GOP tax plan, women are watching (opinion)Story highlights Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner: The GOP tax plan is especially harmful to women and families

The plan would grow our national debt while rewarding ultra-rich individuals and corporations, she writes

Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner is executive director and co-founder of MomsRising.org, a nonprofit national organization that supports policies to improve family economic security. She is the author of the forthcoming book, "Keep Marching." The views expressed here are her own.

(CNN) Tax plans can be hard to decipher, but with each passing day, women and moms across the country understand more clearly how the GOP tax plans — both the US Senate and the House versions -- will affect their families and our economy.

At MomsRising, we hear from moms -- from Alaska to Alabama -- every day and they are telling us they are terrified. Over the last few weeks, we've seen rumblings of concern turn to full-fledged alarm about what this tax plan will mean for America's women. Their worries are certainly justified.

The GOP tax plans are the opposite of what women and our economy need. Women in the United States of America are already facing severe economic inequality at the exact same time as the cost of raising children, and the percentage of families who are relying on the wages of women to make ends meet, are rising quickly. Times have changed. For instance, women are now breadwinners in more than half of all families — and are the primary breadwinner in 42% of families , according to Pew; and over the past 30 years, childcare costs for working families have increased by 70% , according to Census Bureau data.

Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner

Yet women on average earned just 80 cents to a man's dollar in 2017, with moms and women of color experiencing increased wage hits. Women are under financial duress even as our purchasing power is needed to fuel our economy. That's right: The vast majority of purchasing decisions are made by women in our country, where according to the World Bank, 70% of our GDP is now based on consumer spending.

Economic inequality for women is a huge weakness for our nation, and the GOP proposed tax plans in the US House and Senate could turn that disaster into a national calamity.-1

http://time.com/5044596/rope-tree-journalist-walmart-shirt-removed-threatening/?xid=homepageWalmart Removes 'Rope. Tree. Journalist.' Shirt from StoreWalmart has removed a shirt bearing the words “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some assembly required” from its website, following a complaint from a journalist advocacy group.

The shirt was listed on Walmart’s website through a third-party seller, Teespring, which allows people to post their own designs for sale.

“This item was sold by a third-party seller on our marketplace and clearly violates our policy,” a Walmart statement said, according to CBS News. “We removed it as soon as it was brought to our attention, and are conducting a thorough review of the seller’s assortment.” Walmart reportedly removed the shirt five hours after the complaint was made, according to the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), which made the complaint.

In their letter of complaint, the group said the shirts could “at the least… inflame the passions of those who either don’t like, or don’t understand, the news media. At worst, they openly encourage violence targeting journalists.”

“We are grateful for Walmart’s swift action,” said RTDNA Executive Director Dan Shelley, “but dismayed that it, and anyone else selling the shirt, would offer such an offensive and inflammatory product.”

He continued: “We live in an environment in which political and ideological discourse has deteriorated to the level where some find it appropriate to advocate violence targeting journalists merely for performing their Constitutionally-guaranteed duty to seek and report the truth.”

The shirt had previously been spotted at a campaign rally for Donald Trump in 2016.

According to the U.S. press freedom tracker, there have been 35 physical attacks on journalists so far in 2017, and journalists have had their equipment seized, stolen or damaged in 24 instances.-1
http://time.com/5044606/colleges-review-honors-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations/?xid=homepageColleges Review Honors Amid Sexual Misconduct AllegationsThe wave of sexual allegations from Hollywood to Washington has left many U.S. colleges weighing whether to revoke honorary degrees and other accolades awarded to prominent men accused of misconduct.

Dozens of schools have bestowed honors upon men who now face accusations ranging from sexual harassment to assault. Fired news anchor Charlie Rose has at least nine honorary degrees, for example, and Pixar executive John Lasseter has two.

Some schools have already started cutting ties, including the University at Buffalo, which rescinded a 2001 honorary degree awarded to film mogul and alumnus Harvey Weinstein. The University of Kansas and Arizona State recently pulled two journalism awards from Rose, citing allegations of groping and inappropriate behavior from several women.

But other schools have yet to decide the fate of similar symbolic accolades, which are often given to honor success but have increasingly been withdrawn when recipients fall from grace.

“It’s an issue that more colleges are facing now, and I think each one will look very carefully at these situations and make their own determination,” said Timothy McDonough, a vice president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges.

Three schools — North Carolina State, New York’s Oswego State and New Jersey’s Montclair State — are all reconsidering honorary degrees given to Rose before he was fired from CBS and PBS on Nov. 21.

The final decision at North Carolina State and Oswego State will be made by their governing boards, which traditionally hold the power to confer and rescind degrees. Oswego State officials said Thursday that they have started the process to revoke Rose’s 2014 honorary degree.

“These are credible allegations of predatory sexual harassment that completely conflict with the core values of our institution and significantly degrade the achievements that were the basis for awarding him an honorary degree,” university President Deborah Stanley said.

Some others, however, are standing behind similar commendations.

The Juilliard School in New York, which gave an honorary doctorate to actor Kevin Spacey in 2000, said it does not rescind such honors. Spokeswoman Alexandra Day said the degrees are granted “based on information known about the artist at the time of the award.”

Only hours after NBC host Matt Lauer was fired on Wednesday, some alumni of Ohio University, his alma mater, were calling on officials to scrub his legacy from the school. University officials said they were “disappointed to hear of Matt Lauer’s alleged conduct” but have no policy to revoke a 1999 Medal of Merit awarded to him.

After another prominent OU alumnus, Fox News founder Roger Ailes, was accused of sexual harassment, the university decided last year to take his name off a campus newsroom and return a $500,000 gift.

Georgetown University declined to comment on an honorary degree given to Rose in 2015 but said the school has never revoked one.

McDonough, of the governing boards association, said it’s rare for schools to rescind honors but that more are likely to do so following the recent rash of allegations. At many schools, it’s a question of whether the recipient’s alleged actions come into significant conflict with the university’s ideals, he said.

Efforts to strip honors have come from students, faculty, administrators and outside critics. More than 20 schools have rescinded honorary degrees given to comedian Bill Cosby, accused by dozens of women of various kinds of sexual misconduct including assault, amid pressure from students and staff. The few that have not rescinded honors from Cosby include Temple University, his alma mater.

Student newspapers at North Carolina State and Duke University recently published editorials saying Rose should be stripped of honors from the schools. Officials at Duke, where Rose studied and received an honorary doctorate in 2016, declined to respond specifically to the Rose case but said the school has never revoked any of the hundreds of honorary degrees conferred since the 1920s.

Universities vary widely in their policies for granting honorary degrees, and even more so in their rules for revoking them. Many are given to prominent figures who speak on campus or to notable alumni. Governing boards often take recommendations from the president and discuss the matter in private sessions to avoid public scrutiny.

Marist College, a private school in New York, has faced calls to rescind a 2001 honorary degree given to alumnus and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly over allegations of harassment, but the school has no formal policy for giving or rescinding awards. Spokeswoman Julia Fishman said the governing board recently started the process to craft one.

Robert O’Neil, a former president at the University of Virginia, said honorary degrees are supposed to honor professional achievement but often have other motivations.

“In many cases, it’s just to recognize a wealthy donor,” O’Neil told the AP. “I think the eclectic or haphazard process at some institutions risks creating a very bad precedent.”

Tax records show that some recently accused men have donated to the schools that honored them. Rose contributed at least $9,500 to Duke through his foundation between 2013 and 2015, records show, while O’Reilly gave $25,000 to Marist in that period, along with a $1 million donation to start a scholarship program.

Many universities declined to comment on honors given to embroiled men, including Clark Atlanta University, which gave an honorary doctorate to Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in May, and the Savannah College of Art and Design, which conferred one to Lasseter in 2015.

Some schools, however, have long shunned the practice of awarding honorary degrees. The University of Virginia and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology forbid it, with policies that stem from the teachings of Thomas Jefferson, who sometimes disparaged all degrees as “meaningless credentials.”

O’Neil said other schools may need to adopt similar policies to avoid embarrassment in the future, while others will likely be more selective when choosing recipients.

“I expect that the whole process will be much tidier and much more conscientious going forward,” he said. “They don’t want to make any mistakes now.”-1

Trevor Noah kicked things off on The Daily Show by noting that Lauer is just the latest in a long line of media figures who have been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior. “How many news people is this now?” Noah said. “There was Bill O’Reilly, Charlie Rose, Mark Halperin. Soon they’ll have enough guys to start their own perv news network.”

Kimmel took a different approach, recounting the moment he learned of Lauer’s dismissal. “This morning my wife looked at her phone and went, ‘Oh my God, Matt Lauer!'” he explained. “Which, of course, I assumed he was dead. So I guess this is better? I don’t know.”

The Live! host also got in a jab at Trump, who had responded to the news by tweeting, “Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for ‘inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.’ But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News.”

“If anyone knows about inappropriate behavior in the workplace at NBC, it’s Donald J. Trump,” Kimmel said. “Is he aware that he’s him? I don’t think he is. I think he sees Donald Trump on TV and goes, ‘I like that guy.'”

Colbert, on the other hand, cut right to the Trump chase, referencing the allegations of sexual misconduct that have been leveled against the President himself.

“By ‘fake news’ do you mean more than a dozen women have accused Trump of improper conduct or sexual assault? Is that what you mean?” the Late Show host wondered. “You don’t get to comment. That is the pot calling the kettle at 3 a.m. and asking what she’s wearing.”

http://time.com/5044481/donald-trump-replace-rex-tillerson-state-mike-pompeo/?xid=homepageDonald Trump 'Could Replace Rex Tillerson With Mike Pompeo'(WASHINGTON) — After months of clashes on policy and personality, President Donald Trump is considering ousting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replacing him with hard-nosed CIA Director Mike Pompeo following less than a year on the job, senior U.S. officials said Thursday as turmoil within Trump’s national security team burst into the open.

The White House plan, which Trump has not yet signed off on, would force a major realignment early in his term, also creating a vacancy atop the CIA that officials said could be filled by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. The overhaul could produce a significant shift in both the tone and direction of the president’s foreign policy, removing it from the understated former oil man whose style has never fit well with Trump’s.

It is exceedingly rare for a secretary of state, America’s face on the global stage, to be fired or to serve for a year or less. Nor is it common for presidents to have such a significant Cabinet revamp so soon after taking office. Too much churn could fuel the perception of chaos in the Trump White House — perhaps one reason he has yet to pull the trigger.

Tillerson’s likely ouster, which was first reported by the New York Times, loomed awkwardly over an Oval Office meeting Thursday between Trump and the visiting Bahraini crown prince. Asked by a reporter whether he wanted Tillerson to stay on the job, Trump was coy, merely pointing out that Tillerson was in fact in the building.

“He’s here. Rex is here,” the president said.

Timing for any move was uncertain.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Tillerson’s closest ally in the administration, simply brushed off the report. “There’s nothing to it,” he said when asked.

But White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn’t deny it. She did suggest that no move was imminent, saying the president and Tillerson planned to “work together to close out what we’ve seen to be an incredible year.”

Does the president still have confidence in Tillerson? “When the president loses confidence in someone, they will no longer serve in the capacity that they’re in,” she said.

Friction between the president and the nation’s top diplomat has grown increasingly public through the year.

After a report last month that Tillerson had called the president a “moron,” Tillerson was forced to appear before cameras at the State Department to pledge fealty his boss. Soon after, Trump publicly challenged his secretary to an IQ match.

For Tillerson, who left his job as Exxon Mobil’s CEO, a premature departure from the Cabinet has seemed increasingly inevitable.

“There’s been a Tillerson death watch since the spring,” said Derek Chollet, a former State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council official in the Obama administration.

When Tillerson was tapped for the job late last year, many Trump critics expressed quiet relief that he’d picked a sober “adult” who could form a counterweight to the president’s brasher, impulsive approach, especially on critical matters of war and peace.

Yet divisions on key foreign policy issues emerged quickly, and Trump has repeatedly undermined Tillerson by voicing positions at odds with those the State Department was pushing.

When Tillerson in June called on Arab nations to ease their blockade on Qatar, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden hours later to lambaste Qatar for funding terrorism. Trump also deemed diplomacy with North Korea a waste of time, when Tillerson was pursuing just that. Tillerson’s advice to Trump to stay in the Paris climate deal and certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal was similarly overruled.

Pompeo, in contrast, has formed a tight relationship with Trump that’s led to a role much broader than many past CIA chiefs. A former businessman and conservative Republican congressman from Kansas, Pompeo is at the White House nearly every day to deliver the daily intelligence briefing, a task often delegated to less senior officials. He sometimes stays longer to accompany Trump to other meetings. He shares the president’s hardline stance against Iran.

Cotton, a top contender to take over at CIA, has been one of Trump’s staunchest defenders on foreign policy in Congress. Yet moving him would create a Senate vacancy just as Republicans need every vote possible. Under Arkansas law, if Cotton steps down before next July, the state’s Republican governor would appoint a replacement who would serve until the November 2018 election. If Cotton stays in the Senate, his current term doesn’t end until 2020.

Cotton’s office wouldn’t comment other than to say: “Senator Cotton’s focus is on serving Arkansans in the Senate.”

Several administration officials said that Pompeo has said previously he’s open to the job.

Tillerson’s top priority as secretary has been his sweeping overhaul of the State Department, a “redesign” that has been lambasted by lawmakers from both parties and that the State Department concedes has hurt morale among diplomats. Still, Tillerson aides say he expects to remain in his role to see the overhaul through.

At the White House, meanwhile, frustration with Tillerson has mounted over what officials have described as Tillerson’s aloofness and his slowness in filling key roles to carry out the president’s agenda.

By September, the White House was telling some people that Tillerson would be replaced and some issues needing sign-off from the secretary of state were being put off until after he was gone, said a senior administration official, who like others wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and demanded anonymity.

Tillerson’s future came up in the Oval Office earlier this month at a meeting in which White House officials closest to the president agreed the Texan should go — and soon — said one individual who consults regularly with the administration. But Trump never signed off, and officials have struggled to focus his attention on the matter, the individual said.

No matter how long Tillerson is allowed to stay on, his stature and ability to speak on Trump’s behalf has been impaired, it is widely agreed.-1
http://time.com/4895011/rex-tillerson-still-in-the-game-at-state/?xid=homepageDealt a Weak Hand, Rex Tillerson Is Still In the Game at StateU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson deserves better than some of the shots fired at him lately, particularly in a scathing Washington Post op-ed by former George W. Bush aide Michael Gerson labeling him a “huge disappointment.” It was always going to be an uphill battle for him to be an effective diplomat-in-chief. President Trump has empowered his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is essentially acting as the nation’s Prime Minister, to vet major foreign policy decisions while sitting just steps from the Oval Office. Given that Trump is frequently most influenced by the last person he sees before making important decisions, Foggy Bottom might as well be in North Dakota.

Still, Tillerson has had some significant foreign policy wins of late. The unanimous U.N. Security Council vote to endorse new sanctions against North Korea on Aug. 5 is at the top of the list. Tillerson’s assertiveness on the issue, along with that of U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, helped rally allies and rivals alike to back the toughest sanctions to date against the Kim Jong Un regime. And if there’s one foreign policy official from his Administration whom Trump trusts to deal with Russia, it is Tillerson, thanks in part to the relationships he built with Russian President Vladimir Putin and others in the Kremlin during his time as ExxonMobil CEO. When Trump met with Putin on July 7 at the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, it was Tillerson whom he brought with him, an important vote of confidence from the President given just how sensitive the Russia issue has become at home.

But Tillerson still struggles to effectively manage his State Department. He spent more than 40 years at ExxonMobil–and over 10 as CEO–but State Department decisionmaking is nowhere near as top-down as inside the energy giant. An effective Secretary of State must empower seasoned foreign policy professionals and channel their significant expertise into serving the President’s agenda. Colin Powell, for example, did this exceedingly well; by all accounts, Tillerson is much more insular and reliant on a smaller staff than his predecessors, and it shows. A Secretary of State must manage, but also inspire, the country’s diplomatic corps. On that front, Tillerson has fallen short.

So while he deserves mixed reviews, Tillerson’s job performance 200 days into the Administration should be graded on a curve, given the extenuating circumstances the Trump presidency has imposed on him. He might have fared much better in a “normal” Administration, where his business background and managerial experience would inject new energy into an at-times sclerotic institution. He’s been playing a weak hand moderately well. Given the threats facing the world in 2017, it’s far from clear that that will be enough.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/01/european-businesses-are-readying-themselves-for-a-massive-shift-in-data-protection-rules.htmlEuropean businesses are readying themselves for a massive shift in data protection rulesCompanies in Europe will have to comply with updated rules on data protection from next May, when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will start to apply .

The new regulation will update the 1995 Data Protection Directive — introduced at a time when the digital age was in its infancy — and will impact both citizens and businesses.



Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor, told CNBC in an interview that it was "time for a new culture in terms of data protection."



The changes that will come with the GDPR are significant. Among other things, it will boost people's right to be forgotten and guarantee free, easy access to personal data.

Organizations and businesses will also have to inform people about data breaches that could negatively impact them, and do this "without undue delay." Relevant data protection supervisory authorities also need to be informed.

The European Commission (EC) has said that a new single law on data protection will replace "the current inconsistent patchwork of national laws." Businesses, it says, will be able to deal with one law rather than 28, with the financial benefits estimated at 2.3 billion euros ($2.74 billion) per year.



For Paul Clarke, chief technology officer at online grocer Ocado, the issue of customer data is an important one.



"Privacy and security are very, very important topics for our customers. But at the same time, what's also important to them is to be able to shop with ever-increasing levels of personalization, with greater convenience," he said.



"There's a kind of balance to be struck between using data responsibly but harnessing it in order to deliver what customers want."

At bookseller Waterstones, managing director James Daunt said that the new regulations are being introduced at an opportune time for his business. Its answer to GDPR, he said, has been to invest.



"We happen to be at a stage of the investment cycle when we really need to invest in this, and therefore can re-launch our loyalty card, re-launch our apps, re-launch, effectively, the way in which we keep people's data and the permissions we have and the rules around how we're going to use that," he said.



This was, Daunt added, "effectively renewing the compact [contract] that we have with our customers."



European data protection supervisor Buttarelli said that retailers would be treated like "responsible adults." When breaches occur, sanctions would be "extremely severe" — up to 4 percent of the annual worldwide turnover.

The transaction represents a move by the ISE to deepen ties with mainland Europe and an effort by Euronext to expand its revenue base and its position in debt and fund listings.

Asked if the deal was focused primarily on bridging Brexit uncertainties, ISE Chief Executive Deirdre Somers told CNBC that she did not believe that to be the case.

"This deal is very strategically driven by the Irish Stock Exchange," she said Thursday. "We decided that we have growth ambitions, and that we needed the technology and the brand and some of the capabilities we didn't have ourselves, and we decided ultimately that Euronext was the best complement for us."

The ISE has more than 30,000 securities from 80 countries and 4,000 issuers listed on its markets.

"Brexit has two consequences for Ireland," Somers went on. "The first is obviously the immediate impact of Brexit on the Irish economy. The second is that we need to redefine our relationship with a very different Europe, a Europe without the U.K.

"The U.K. has been a very natural ally for Ireland, particularly in financial services in the past. So without a doubt this is a pivot toward the EU, it's a pivot toward our colleagues in Europe, and it's the ISE saying our future is in Europe, and we prefer to be part of that European family in a more integrated way."

Stephane Boujnah, chief executive of Euronext, described the deal as strategic.

"This transaction gives us access to a much more diversified revenue base by expanding into the field of leading performance in debt funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds)," Boujnah said.

"And at the same time, it gives us access to a new geography and enlarges the relevance, especially post-Brexit, because in a post-Brexit environment three out of the four cities that are going to be the potential recipients of the post Brexit financial communities — Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin – now Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris will be operating under the same roof."

Euronext aims to step up the ISE's profile as a center for debt, funds and ETF listings. The pan-European group also intends to strengthen its position in relation to larger rivals like Germany's Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange.

Ireland will be the most recent addition to the list of countries in which Euronext operates, joining France, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands and the U.K.0

Albert Wenger, partner at Union Square Ventures, a venture capital firm that has invested in several blockchain start-ups, said there is "irrational exuberance" in the cryptocurrency market, but in the long term, the value of these digital coins could go higher.

"So I believe there's a good chance that cryptocurrencies taken together as a bucket will be worth trillions of dollars. We are a long way from that," Wenger told CNBC in an interview on Thursday.

Bitcoin smashed through the $11,000 mark this week before seeing a pull back. Cryptocurrencies are known for being volatile with huge price swings daily.

Speaking to CNBC at the Slush technology conference in Helisnki, Finland, Wenger said it's too early to tell if cryptocurrencies are in a bubble. But he referenced Amazon's share price since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997, and said a stock chart over the last 20 years is an upward curve.

While Amazon had some steep drops in share price in the early days, the overall share price has risen since it went public.

"If you look at (the) Amazon stock chart, it looks like this massive upward sloping curve. But then if you zoom in you see in the beginning there was this very quick run up and then this big drop off. So the way I look at this (cryptocurrencies) is when we look back at it from far in the future, it will be a very massive run up. The current run up could turn out to be a blip on that chart," Wenger said.

"So I think it's you know, once you reach the territory we are in today, there's definitely a way for it to go down. And there's definitely also a path in the future where, cryptocurrency as a whole will be worth trillions of dollars."0

Earlier this week, Pyongyang said it had test-fired its most advanced missile, putting the U.S. mainland within range, and in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.

The latest provocation from the North prompted more insults from U.S. President Donald Trump, who referred to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un as "Little Rocket Man" and a "sick puppy".

Trump had also dismissed a Chinese diplomatic effort to rein in North Korea's weapons program as a failure on Thursday, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Beijing was doing a lot, but could do more to limit oil supplies to Pyongyang.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/01/trump-urged-senate-republicans-to-drop-panels-russia-probe-report-says.htmlTrump urged Senate Republicans to drop panel's Russia probe, report saysPresident Donald Trump repeatedly urged senior Senate Republicans over the summer to end the Senate Intelligence Committee's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including the panel's chairman, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing several lawmakers and aides.

Senator Richard Burr, the committee's chairman, said in an interview this week Trump told him that he was eager to see the investigation come to an end, the Times reported.

"It was something along the lines of, 'I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible,'" Burr told the Times. He said he replied to Trump that "when we have exhausted everybody we need to talk to, we will finish," the newspaper reported.

The panel is among several congressional committees, along with the Justice Department's special counsel Robert Mueller, investigating allegations that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election and potential collusion by Trump's campaign.

Moscow has denied any meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion.

White House spokesman Raj Shah said on Thursday that the president had not acted improperly, the Times reported.

Trump "at no point has attempted to apply undue influence on committee members" and believes "there is no evidence of collusion and these investigations must come to a fair and appropriate completion," the newspaper quoted Shah as saying.

White House officials did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment.

Trump's requests were a highly unusual intervention from a president into a legislative inquiry involving his family and close aides, the Times said.

Trump also told Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, and Republican Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the intelligence committee, to end the investigation swiftly, the Times reported, citing lawmakers and aides.

Spokesmen for McConnell, Burr and Blunt did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Times quoted Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a former chairwoman of the intelligence committee, as saying in an interview this week that Trump's requests were "inappropriate" and represented a breach of the separation of powers.

"It is pressure that should never be brought to bear by an official when the legislative branch is in the process of an investigation," Feinstein was quoted as saying.-1

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/30/us-formally-opposes-china-market-economy-status-at-wto.htmlUS formally opposes China market economy status at WTOThe United States has formally told the World Trade Organization (WTO) that it opposes granting China market economy status, a position that if upheld would allow Washington to maintain high anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods.

The statement of opposition, made public on Thursday, was submitted as a third-party brief in support of the European Union in a dispute with China that could have major repercussions for the trade body's future.

China is fighting the EU for recognition as a market economy, a designation that would lead to dramatically lower anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods by prohibiting the use of third-country price comparisons.

The U.S. and EU argue that the state's pervasive role in the Chinese economy, including rampant granting of subsidies, mean that domestic prices are deeply distorted and not market-determined.

A victory for China before the WTO would weaken many countries' trade defenses against a flood of cheap Chinese goods, putting the viability of more western industries at risk.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress in June that the case was "the most serious litigation we have at the WTO right now" and a decision in China's favor "would be cataclysmic for the WTO."

Lighthizer has repeatedly expressed frustration with the WTO's dispute settlement body and has called for major changes at the organization.

The USTR brief, which follows a Commerce Department finding in October that China fails the tests for a market economy, argues that China should not automatically be granted market economy by virtue of the expiration of its 2001 accession protocol last year.

"The evidence is overwhelming that WTO members have not surrendered their longstanding rights ... to reject prices or costs that are not determined under market economy conditions in determining price comparability for purposes of anti-dumping comparisons," the brief concludes.

The move comes as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are increasing as the Trump administration prepares several possible major trade actions, including broad tariffs or

quotas on steel and aluminum and an investigation into Chinese intellectual property misappropriation.

The Commerce Department on Tuesday launched the first government-initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations in decades on Chinese aluminum sheet imports.

U.S. officials say that 16 years of WTO membership has failed to end China's market-distorting state practices.

"We are concerned that China's economic liberalization seems to have slowed or reversed, with the role of the state increasing" David Malpass, U.S. Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, told an event in New York on Thursday.

"State-owned enterprises have not faced hard budget constraints and China's industrial policy has become more and more problematic for foreign firms. Huge exports credits are flowing in non-economic ways that distort markets," Malpass said.

The brief submitted to the WTO also argues that China should be treated the same way as communist eastern European countries, including Poland, Romania and Hungary were when they joined the WTO's predecessor organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

A senior U.S. official said those countries eventually earned market economy status as evidence of state subsidies and state distortions waned. He added that going forward, WTO members wishing to use third-country price comparisons against Chinese imports would need to keep presenting evidence of economic distortions.-1
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/30/will-tech-trump-tradition-the-future-of-bookselling.htmlWill tech trump tradition? The future of booksellingWuthering Heights, East of Eden, To Kill a Mockingbird: getting lost in the twists and turns of a great novel is a pastime enjoyed by millions the world over.

But while the plots of such timeless classics remain the same, the technology we use to buy and consume them has transformed. Today, we can read books on a range of devices, from phones and tablets to desktops and e-readers.



With their slick interfaces and speedy delivery, online businesses such as Amazon and eBay have shaken up the bookselling market. Their models have made it possible to purchase books from the comfort of our homes with just a few clicks, often at a fraction of the price compared to a "bricks and mortar" store.



Like many other retailers, Waterstones — which operates hundreds of bookstores in the U.K. — has faced increasingly intense competition from online sellers in recent years.



Its managing director, James Daunt, joined the business in 2011. How is innovative technology — machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), big data and robotics — going to transform Waterstones in the future?



"The high street that you see, the high street shop that you see today, is not going to change greatly, particularly a bookshop like ours — we're going to continue selling books because it is a wonderful product," he told CNBC in comments broadcast this week.



Daunt stressed the importance of human interaction to his business and how the way books are bought and sold required a decidedly human touch. "How they're chosen, how they're displayed, a human's going to do that. The customer service is going to be by a human. Anybody who doesn't do that — who goes to robotics, who goes to self-service — is going to die."



Changes in the business would still take place, however. "What we are going to do is become extraordinarily efficient in how we get the books here, how our supply chain is dealt with, how we communicate with you, how we tell you about things," Daunt said.



He added that while the business would embrace technology, it would do things that customers want, such as putting Wi-Fi in stores. The business, he said, was always trying to work out how to make its shops "the nicest possible place in which to spend time."

"We've returned to those core values of bookselling and… have done so with increasing enthusiasm, which has translated into ever better sales."

Don't panic: this isn't a tech selloff, according to famed tech investor Dan Niles.

Niles, founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners, also recommended taking advantage of temporarily dragging FAANG stocks to invest in Facebook.

"Let's be realistic, this isn't much of a selloff," Niles said Thursday on CNBC's "Fast Money." "These stocks are all down a few percentage points, and I think it speaks to the fact that we haven't had a real selloff since January 2016."

Stocks of the FAANG companies -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent company Alphabet -- all dropped roughly 1 to 4 percent this week for a combined market cap loss of about $60 billion. What's more, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet marked four of the five biggest drags on the S&P 500.

Despite the combined losses, Niles still recommended buying Facebook, citing the social media giant's double-digit earnings and revenue gains, among other metrics.

"There's a big difference between an Amazon at single digit operating margins, and a Facebook at 50 percent operating margins, or a Netflix that has negative 3 cash flow for the next couple years," Niles said.

"From a standpoint of risk and reward, it's one that we really like," he added.

And while he maintains his confidence in big tech, Niles does think the market will start getting more competitive for tech companies. As big tech continues to crowd the market, he foresees semiconductors and internet names struggling.

"I think other areas of tech are likely to struggle," Niles said. "But I do still think there are still some really good buys within technology."0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/30/gop-tax-bill-will-crush-puerto-ricos-economy-governor-says-commentary.htmlGOP tax bill would crush Puerto Rico's already devastated economy, Governor says"Applying this 20 percent tax to products made in Puerto Rico would put tens of thousands of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico out of work and demolish our tax base right as we are trying to rebound from historic storms"

Today, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico ranks fifth in world pharmaceutical production with over 70 plants. We rank third in biotechnology with over 2 million square feet of plant space. All told, the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices represents roughly a third of the entire Puerto Rican economy, according the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

More broadly, manufacturing is central to Puerto Rico's economy, comprising half of our gross domestic product, a third of our tax base and three-quarters of our exports ($14.5 billion in 2016). Manufacturing employs 75,000 Puerto Ricans in good-paying jobs and another 160,000 people whose jobs depend on the manufacturing sector. This could represent about 25 percent of our workforce. Real people, real jobs. All at risk, unless Congress fixes this poorly constructed new levy.

The House and Senate bills were written to prevent companies from relocating to lower-tax countries or gaming the existing tax code by shifting profits to overseas tax havens. This change runs the risk of hobbling some companies with multi-national supply chains. Aside from an economic catastrophe, applying it to Puerto Rico really makes no sense: Companies that operate in Puerto Rico have chosen to do business in the United States and have created thousands of needed jobs for U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.

Operating costs are higher in Puerto Rico because businesses comply with U.S. laws and regulations, including the minimum wage and environmental and labor rules. By applying base erosion rules to companies in Puerto Rico, Congress would severely undermine Puerto Rico's competitiveness with low-cost foreign jurisdictions.

Congress enacted PROMESA last year to enable Puerto Rico to restore economic health in an orderly process. As congressional leaders said, "PROMESA is not a bailout for Puerto Rico. PROMESA will prevent a bailout by federal taxpayers." By enacting this new levy, tax reform would only make it harder for Puerto Rico to regain its financial and fiscal stability and would only make a bailout more likely.

When our administration took office this year, we implemented a range of difficult measures and adopted a demanding, but achievable, ten-year fiscal plan to achieve economic recovery within about six years. That plan was dependent on preservation of Puerto Rico's manufacturing sector, as well as our tax base.

In the aftermath of those destructive hurricanes, we cannot afford to take a hit from Congress. Congress should not apply the same-base erosion provisions to Puerto Rico they have created to stop companies from shifting profits to overseas tax havens. It would cripple our economy at the moment we are most vulnerable.

In an interview with Spotify, the singer and actress said working with Anthony on her upcoming Spanish-language album “Por Primera Vez” helped mend those parts of her relationship with her ex-husband and the father of twins Max and Emme.

“It actually kind of repaired certain parts of our relationship that had been fractured from our marriage and our divorce and it kind of made us friends again,” Lopez said in the first interview on ”¡Viva Latino! A Spotify Original Podcast,” released Thursday.

The former power couple have collaborated musically since the 1990s. Lopez appeared in Anthony’s music video for “No Me Conoces” and later the two recorded the duet “No Me Ames.” Lopez told Spotify that working on the upcoming album reminded her of how the two had originally bonded over music.

“When we first started working together it’s how we met, we met working,” Lopez said. “And so we remembered that like, oh right, we connect on this level of music. And we have that. And that’s what the album came out of.”

Lopez announced in October 2016 that she would be working with Anthony on her second all-Spanish album, which is set to be released before the end of year.

“I am so excited and really looking forward to this new musical journey and to celebrate my Latin roots with Marc Anthony and the Sony/Magnus family,” Lopez said in a statement at the time.1

And how do I explain Mr. Claus to them without taking away the “magic” of the holiday season?

We asked the HuffPost Parents community if they’ve tackled the “Santa talk” with their children. While some moms and dads who celebrate Christmas said they never told their kids that a man came down the chimney to leave them presents (and encouraged their little ones to not spoil the spirit of giving for others), some parents offered lovely explanations of how they talked to their kids about jolly old St. Nick.

Here are 11 ways parents have explained Santa to their kids (and a few funny reactions to boot).

He lives in the thoughts and the hearts of everyone who does something selfless for another person.

“I told my children Santa is real, but not in the way that we think of as real. He lives in the thoughts and the hearts of everyone who does something selfless for another person. With that act, they become the essence of what we know to be Santa. My kids are in their 20s now and if you ask them, they will proudly say they believe in Santa.”

― Angela Robbins

Well, it’s a fun magic to add to Christmas.

“My oldest was 8 and got curious so he started to press for information. After telling him it was a choice to believe or not to believe, and asking him, ‘What do you think and feel about it?’ he responded that he thought it was pretend. He said he felt that his dad and I were Santa. My reply was, ‘Well, it’s a fun magic to add to Christmas. And Dad and I love to surprise you on Christmas morning. And your sisters still think Santa’s coming, so help us keep the magic going.’ With that he has been awesome. He still plays along to keep the surprise and magic of Christmas morning.”

― Teresa Ingram

He seemed relieved and wanted confirmation of his thoughts.

“My 9-year-old asked, ‘Is Santa real? It’s OK if the answer is no.’ I told him no, that it was Mom and Dad filling the stockings and buying the presents, but he is real in the sense that he is a symbol of Christmas, a symbol of giving. We also tackled the Elf on the Shelf, Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. He seemed relieved and wanted confirmation of his thoughts, but told me that we can still hide the elf and I can still mark some presents from Santa!”

― Jessica Waagner

We do Santa’s job in order to continue to spread his message of hope, spirit and love.

“My then 10-year-old asked during his younger brother’s karate class. At first, I answered as I had before, ‘What do you think?’ And he said, ‘I don’t know.’

“After his brother went to bed, my husband and I talked to him one-on-one. I told him, ‘Yes, we put your gifts in your stocking.’ He started crying. I said, ‘But that does not make Daddy or me Santa. We do Santa’s job in order to continue to spread his message of hope, spirit and love. So yes, we put the presents in your stockings, but we are not Santa.’ We also talked about the history of Santa (he’s my history buff) and he handled it all really well.”

― Meaghan Greenleaf Wildes

I was honest with him and his brother, but also made them promise not to ruin it for anyone else.

“My 8-year-old son was having doubts last year so to test his theory, he hid Santa’s cookies. He said if they weren’t eaten, then he would know Santa wasn’t real. I spent an hour searching in the middle of the night for those darn cookies, but never could find them. I told him that maybe Santa just didn’t want to look for them or thought he didn’t make any.

Finally about six months later, he asked me flat-out and I was honest with him and his brother, but also made them promise not to ruin it for anyone else. Then it occurred to them a few weeks ago ― how in the world did Mom and Dad get all those presents set up and keep all those secrets and pick out such cool presents? I think I impressed them.”

― Teri Davis

It’s something they can say to a friend who might try and spoil Santa for them.

“I’m a parent of four kids, but also a fourth-grade teacher. Every year there are questions at school about Santa. My standard response for these 9- and 10-year-olds is, ‘If you believe in Santa, he believes in you.’ It seems to work. And it’s something they can say to a friend who might try and spoil Santa for them.”

― Vicki Thompson Paris

She’s now Santa and the Tooth Fairy for her sister.

“I had the talk with my daughter about the spirit of giving and becoming a Santa herself. She was about to be 8, and she was already saying he’s not real and that she knew it already. I figured she heard it from classmates. She had me so convinced telling every member of our family that she knew, that one night, I decided to show her how other countries and cultures view Santa and his origin, before asking her to become a Santa for someone else.

In the end, I asked her if she enjoyed it while it lasted and if she felt we should continue the tales for her little sister who’s 2. She thought about it for a moment and replied that even though she didn’t like that we lied to her about the Tooth Fairy and Santa, she did like staying up and trying to catch them in their magic, so she’s now Santa and the Tooth Fairy for her sister, as she feels I am not convincing enough. She believes that she can conceal her magical identity better than I did for her.”

― Jenn Aguilar

He wrapped it up with a very gentle, “Thank you for telling me the truth about Santa, Mommy.”

“One night, as I was tucking in my sweet little one, he asked, ‘Is Santa real?’ I stopped for a second, then asked what he believed. ‘Some people say he’s not, but I’ve seen him. But I think you, me, Buela (my mom), and my cousins are the only ones left who believe.’

I then started telling him that a long time ago, there was a man who would give gifts to children, and his spirit lives on in each of us to this day (slight paraphrase). After a few blinks, he just started crying. ‘You mean Santa is dead?!’ he said.

Ugh. I had one chance, and I blew it. We talked for a bit, and he calmed down. He wrapped it up with a very gentle, ‘Thank you for telling me the truth about Santa, Mommy. I love you.’ Whew.”

― Selma Altas

This makes them a part of the magic and fun because what is better than getting to be Santa?

“We transition from belief in Santa to becoming an elf, helping to instill the spirit of giving, love, and Christmas by becoming part of the magic. Once one of our children had expressed they were no longer a believer in Santa, they were let in on the secret in order to help keep the magic alive for the next sibling. We emphasize how important it is to not deflate the younger sibling’s belief, and allow the older child to participate in hiding the mischievous elf or filling stockings. This makes them a part of the magic and fun because what is better than getting to be Santa? It has worked well so far. I’ve got one kiddo to go!”

― Kendra Votava

It’s up to you to believe in magic and in the spirit of giving, no matter what that looks like on the TV screen or in the stores.

“When my daughter was very young, she asked me to confirm if some of her friends were right about Santa not being real. I asked her back, ‘Should we stop giving and being kind to people if we find out Santa’s just a marketing trick?’ She said, ‘No.’ Well, that’s your answer right there. It’s up to you to believe in magic and in the spirit of giving, no matter what that looks like on the TV screen or in the stores.

Now she is almost 11 and the other day said to me, ‘Mom, how could I believe you’d allow an old man to watch me when I am sleeping and let a stranger come into our house at night?’ And I said, ‘Of course I would not do that, Sonia, because Santa couldn’t possibly be just an ordinary guy. He is the spirit of giving, remember?’ She went ahead and wrote her letter to Santa, but it may be for the last time ever, so I’d better go look for that virtual reality thingy she asked for.”

― Ana Nita

They know he doesn’t exist as a person.

“We’ve told them that we are all Santa when we give our time, money or gifts to others. They know he doesn’t exist as a person, but that he is the spirit of Christmas.”

Reading praise for an advert being “photoshop free”, I found myself questioning, what does that mean anymore? Whenever an advertising campaign uses buzzwords like “photoshop-free”, I am always intrigued by what the company’s version of not altering a woman’s body looks like. Fashion brand Anine Bing’s latest lingerie campaign is photoshop-free. It features a range of women aged between 19 and 64. The founder of the LA based and Scandinavian influenced store stated in her blog: “The campaign is about loving yourself, celebrating yourself, being yourself, and wearing what you want to wear for yourself!”. The campaign follows nine women who are are entrepreneurs, cancer survivors, philanthropists and mothers, and it focuses on these women being photographed in their “natural environment” - the selection in the diversity of women is conscious and praised. Though the self-love aspect is fitting for a lingerie advert, unfortunately it does not feel inspiring.

The message behind the campaign may have been about body positivity and loving the places we all call home, but most of Anine Bing’s models were slim and model-esque, especially in the visuals shared with Teen Vogue. This campaign is not explicitly made up of an assortment of body shapes, as would be required for it to be in the body positive arena - a term used to help women feel secure and beautiful regardless of their body shape. From size, to scarring, to body hair, being proud of your body is the core value behind this movement on social media. The Anine Bing campaign, which displays videos and photographs of women in the underwear sold, does tell stories of pregnancy and different creative leadership roles some of the women have. Props are definitely to be given to Bing and her team for viewing diversity as being about more than just casting ‘ethnic’ models (ie. including a cancer survivor), but all of the bodies shown in the campaign still fit into Eurocentric and normative beauty standards. But for a campaign projecting variety, this seemed two dimensional; as if the clothing and accessories brand was on the ‘inclusivity’ bandwagon without truly committing. The campaign was made up largely of white women stylised in their “natural setting” - out of nine models, just two are women of colour. And although a few bumps may be shown on the models’ flesh through the simple act of sitting down, this is not anything new or boundary-pushing.

Instead of having a campaign which reflected reality, the advert was shown through a lens, which may not have had any post photoshop editing, but was narrow in displaying a broad spectrum of beauty and perceptions of women. Plus - much can be achieved to portray beauty still far from the reality of many, with good natural light and rose-tinted editing. Lingerie can be seductive and sexy, and underwear models have for the majority of time been suggested to also think a certain way. Anine Bing had an opportunity to portray women in their underwear to be more interesting and well-rounded but fell into the trap of cliches. One of their campaign models was founder of skincare line, Jessica Gomes. When featured on Anine Bing’s blog, Gomes was noted to be feeling “cheeky and naughty” in her lingerie.0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/news/economy/recession-anniversary/index.html10 years after the recession began, have Americans recovered?It's been ten years since the start of the Great Recession.

That's an arbitrary anniversary, sure. But downturns need beginnings, and the National Bureau of Economic Research decided this one happened in December 2007, when employment peaked and started to head south -- for two long years.

What followed: The loss of more than eight million jobs, half the value of the Dow and the S&P 500, and trillions of dollars in retirement accounts and household wealth. Lives and businesses were ruined and whole neighborhoods emptied out, as banks took back homes bought on badly underwritten credit.

A decade later, the American economy has recovered in many ways. Employers have been steadily adding jobs since early 2010, the stock market is booming and home prices have reached new all-time highs.

Related: U.S. economy posts best growth in years

But in other ways, Americans still carry the scars of the recession, some of which will never heal.

Take Karen Moyers, 58, of Conroe, Texas. After building up her savings in the hairdressing business, she lost nearly all of it in an investment fund managed by a financial advisor during the crash. Now, she is working in a jewelry store for lower wages than she once made and only has enough savings to live on for about a year should she lose her job.

"I can't save any money like I used to," Moyers said. "You think it'll come back, and it never came back."

One decade later, here's where the economy has recovered and where it still has a ways to go.

Jobs are back, but the workforce has shrunk

One of the most remarkable aspects of America's rebound is the unemployment rate. It sunk to a 16-year low of 4.1% in October, with some industries — like trucking, construction, and oilfield services — reporting difficulty finding workers.

Even a more expansive measure of unemployment -- which includes people who want a job but have been discouraged from looking for one and those who work part-time but want to work full-time -- has matched its pre-recession low of 7.9%.

But even that isn't the whole story. The share of Americans who are working or want to work has been falling for a couple decades, from a peak of 67.3% in 2000 to 62.5% in 2015.

In large part, that reflects how America's workforce is getting older and retiring faster, and economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas expect the overall rate to keep falling. Still, participation rates for prime-age workers remain depressed as well, with large numbers of people sidelined by opioid addiction, low wages that make work less attractive, and the high cost of childcare that keeps women in particular at home.

There is some good news: As the labor market has tightened up, employers have started to hire people who often face discrimination in the workplace, such as the formerly incarcerated, as Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen mentioned before the Joint Economic Committee this week. Partly as a result of the tighter labor market, African Americans have narrowed the labor force participation gap with white people in recent years, going from more than three percentage points below average labor force participation in 2011 to only half a point today.

Wages are rising, but wealth hasn't recovered

For several years during the recovery, the big problem was wages: Even as hiring picked up, paychecks remained depressed.

That started to change around 2015, as state and local minimum wage hikes kicked in and employers started raising base pay to attract and retain good workers. Now, median household income is back up to approximately where it was in 2007, at just above $59,000 a year.

In 2016, the Federal Reserve found that 70% of adults reported living comfortably or doing okay financially, up from 62% when they began asking the question in 2013.

But the recession didn't just impact earnings — it also took a sledgehammer to savings and investments. The median household's net worth dropped by 40% between 2007 and 2013, according to a triennial survey by the Fed, and had only recovered slightly by 2016.

"It's no surprise that people aren't back to where they were in 2007, but incredibly striking that we haven't gotten back to where we were 20 years ago," said Harvard University economics professor Karen Dynan, a former chief economist at the U.S. Treasury Department. "Even more so because people have gotten older and closer to retirement."

Net worth is also highly stratified by race, with black households holding one-tenth the assets of white households. Also, wealth inequality by income level grew to its widest point ever in 2016.

The decline in net worth has implications for retirement security, with 28% of Americans over age 18 claiming no savings whatsoever, a 2016 Fed survey reported. Still, Americans are feeling better about their prospects, according to Gallup: 54% of those who haven't retired yet say they'll be able to live comfortably when they do. That's up from 38% in 2012, but still below pre-recession levels.

Home prices are rising, but fewer people are buying

A big part of the plunge in household net worth had to do with housing.

As the financial crisis deepened, the delinquency rate for single-family mortgages spiked to 11.5%, and millions of homes went into foreclosure. In three years, the total amount of equity held by homeowners was cut in half.

Now that the real estate market has recovered and mortgages have stabilized, household equity has bounced back to exceed its pre-recession high. The delinquency rate has also steadily been sinking back towards its 2005 low of 1.42%.

However, owning a home just isn't as popular as it used to be. The homeownership rate sank from 69.4% in 2004 to 63.1% in the middle of last year, and has only just started to bounce back.

The reasons behind that trend are complex. First-time homebuyers have been locked out of the market by tight credit, shaky incomes, hefty student loan debts, and skyrocketing home prices in cities with available jobs, forcing many younger people onto the apartment market. Although many of them neither rent nor buy: One in three young people lived with their parents in 2015, up from one in four a decade earlier, the Census Bureau reported.

In recent months, economists have been scanning the horizon for another crisis that could destabilize American families, identifying everything from rising interest rates to subprime auto loans as potential risks.

In a speech this month at the Brookings Institution, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chairman Martin Gruenberg warned against proposals in Congress aimed at weakening the regulations that were passed in the wake of the financial collapse.

Related: Janet Yellen touts economy before stepping down

"History shows that the seeds of banking crises are sown by the decisions banks and bank policymakers make when they have maximum confidence that the horizon is clear," Gruenberg said.

Dismantling the Dodd-Frank rules that keep those institutions in check and protect consumers, he said, will make it harder to protect the economy from a crisis like the one that happened a decade ago.0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/technology/berkeley-cyberwar-hackers-students/index.htmlIn Berkeley's 'Cyberwar' class, students become hackersA new class at the University of California, Berkeley, is training students to hack.

The class, called Cyberwar, teaches its 80 students how to find security flaws in the apps and websites people use every day.

"I mostly focused on government websites, specifically voter registration websites," said Vy-An Phan, a junior studying electrical engineering and computer science who's enrolled in the class.

During class assignments, she discovered vulnerabilities in at least five sites that could potentially be used to trick someone into registering incorrectly.

"What I found was state websites and local websites were usually extremely poorly run," she told CNN Tech. "If I can find [bugs], certainly someone else can."

Twice a week, students pour into Berkeley's Hewlett Packard auditorium to learn how nation-state actors and cybercriminals hack into computer systems. By learning their methods, they can learn to try and stop them.

In addition to government sites, students have also uncovered vulnerabilities in various apps, including from one a bank and shopping sites. One student made $100 after reporting a bug to the company.

Doug Tygar, the computer science professor who teaches the class, calls it an experiment.

"The goal is to train students to build super secure systems," Tygar told CNN Tech after a class. "But in order to do that, they have to be able to think like a hacker."

The class works with HackerOne, a hacker-for-hire platform. Every bug a student finds is reported to the company or organization where it was found. Companies on the HackerOne platform pay hackers who find bugs in their systems. Most students target the companies that use the platform.

Students also hear lectures and attend events hosted in partnership with HackerOne to learn from professional hackers.

"Unless you have the skill of being able to think like a hacker, you're not going to be able to build secure systems," Tygar said.

The Cyberwar class won't be offered next semester, but Tygar plans to teach it again in the future. And he intends to change the name.

Meanwhile, Ted Kramer, chief of staff at HackerOne, said the company wants to bring the program to more campuses.

The class could help prepare students for future employment. According to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures, there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide by 2021.

Phan ultimately wants a job in security testing to help companies keep apps, websites and infrastructure secure.

"I find it much more rewarding than being a developer," she said.0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/media/matt-lauer-payout-nbc/index.htmlNBC News source says Matt Lauer will not receive a payoutMatt Lauer's contract called for him to be paid tens of millions of dollars. But NBC doesn't expect to pay it now that he's been fired.

Lauer "will not be paid past his last day of work," a senior NBC source told CNNMoney on Friday.

Questions have been swirling about the possibility because the New York Post published a story on Thursday that said Lauer's lawyers have been angling to get him a payout.

New York Post's headline: "Lauer's lawyers trying to get him $30M payout after firing."

The $30 million figure was predicated on the fact that Lauer was paid about $20 million a year to co-host the "Today" show -- an extraordinary sum of money that reflects how profitable the morning show is.

The sprawling "Today" show franchise makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year in ad sales.

Lauer's contract was believed to expire in late 2018. However, the New York Post indicated that it extended through the first half of 2019, leading to the $30 million figure.

The senior NBC News source did not dispute that Lauer's attorneys might hatch a plan to get him paid. But the source said the network will not agree to any payout.

Television news contracts typically include a morals clause, giving a network some flexibility to fire a high-priced anchor for cause.

These sorts of issues sometimes end up in arbitration or court, but are usually settled privately.

Related: Lauer allegations show 'we must do a better job,' says NBC News chair

Two people close to Lauer expressed doubt that he would play hardball with his former network. Given reports about his yearly salary over the past decade, he has likely already been paid well in excess of $100 million during his time at NBC. He has multiple properties and investments.

Earlier this week, a source said that Lauer was accepting of NBC's decision to terminate his contract, and expressed remorse when NBC News chairman Andy Lack called him with the news on Tuesday night.

In a statement on Thursday, Lauer said he was "truly sorry" for the pain he has caused.

Three women are known to have filed formal complaints with NBC this week about Lauer's alleged wrongdoing. The first harassment complaint, made on Monday night, triggered an internal investigation and Tuesday night's firing decision.

After his termination was announced on Wednesday, two other accusers reached out to the network.

In a memo on Friday, Lack said NBCUniversal would conduct a review of what happened and would strengthen its internal processes so that staffers feel safe coming forward with allegations of misconduct.

Paying Lauer a huge amount of money on the way out the door would arguably send a contrary message.

21st Century Fox was widely criticized for paying former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes when he resigned under pressure amid a sexual harassment scandal last year. The criticism resumed when Bill O'Reilly reportedly received about $25 million, a severance payment amounting to one year of his four-year contract, when he left Fox earlier this year.-1

The sheriff’s office reported on Wednesday that more than 14 local, state and federal agencies were cooperating in the search for Mariah, and had so far conducted 100 interviews, followed over 140 leads, and searched hundreds of acres of the county by foot, by air and with dogs.

The sheriff’s office posted video Friday of the state highway patrol assisting from the air in the search for Mariah:

“More than 225 investigators, agents, and other law enforcement employees are working around the clock with one goal in mind, to find Mariah and bring her home safely,” the sheriff’s office posted on Facebook.

“Please, bring her back ... She’s my baby, she’s my everything,” Kristy Woods, who lives with her boyfriend, said at a news conference on Monday. “Just to be able to touch her and hold her and not let her go again. I’d give anything.”

The child’s biological father, Alex Woods, has expressed skepticism about her disappearance.

“Someone just walked right up in there, grabbed the 3-year-old out of the bed and she didn’t cry, she didn’t scream?” he told local ABC News affiliate WCTI News on Tuesday. “Nobody heard anything? Four people in the house, two adults and two kids someone just comes up and snatches the baby and walks out?”

In a conversation with journalist Karan Thapar at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in New Delhi, Obama boasted on stage about having “100 million Twitter followers”.

“I actually have more than other people who use it more often,” he added, prompting laughter from the audience who interpreted it as a ding against Trump. (For the record, Obama actually has 97.4 million followers. Trump has 43.8 million).

“I think it’s important to be mindful about both the power of these tools and also its limits and to understand it can be used for both good or for ill,” Obama added, during a more general discussion on technology.

Obama later issued this advice for people using social media:

“Don’t say the first thing that pops into your head, just have a little bit of an edit function, that’s wise for life generally. You see people getting in all kinds of trouble because they sent out some tweet and then they’re trying to erase it afterwards but somebody’s screenshot it and they’re getting embarrassed.”

“Think before you speak, think before you tweet, same principle,” he added.

Sydney Loofe, 24, of Lincoln, Nebraska, was last heard from by her family on Nov. 15. That evening, she went on a second date with a woman she’d met online. The woman she was last seen with, 23-year-old Bailey Boswell, admitted she was with Loofe in the hours before she was reported missing, police said.

Boswell, of Wilber, Nebraska, was arrested Thursday in Taney County, Missouri, on an unrelated charge. Her roommate, 51-year-old Aubrey Trail, was also picked up in Missouri on a charge unrelated to Loofe’s disappearance.

“The Lincoln Police Department has flown down there to speak with them,” Loofe’s mother, Susie Loofe, told HuffPost. “We’re hoping to get answers and find her.”

Someone knows something. Please do the right thing. George Loofe, father of missing woman

Despite being named “persons of interest” by authorities in Nebraska, investigators have not found enough evidence to file charges against Boswell or Trail in Loofe’s disappearance.

According to Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister, Boswell is jailed on an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for missing a court date relating to a drug case. Trail, who has a lengthy criminal record, was wanted for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. Both are being held without bond on a federal hold at the Taney County Jail in Missouri.

Cops want to talk to Boswell and Trail because they “were with Sydney in a very close proximity to the last place that we know where she was,” Bliemeister said at a Thursday news conference at the Hall of Justice in Lincoln.

Loofe’s mother told HuffPost that detectives plan to question the pair sometime Friday.

“The Lincoln Police Department has flown down there to speak with them,” she said. “They are going to do those interviews today.”

There was no word Friday afternoon as to whether Boswell or Trail are cooperating with police. Susie Loofe said the pair are not known to the family.

Prior to their arrests, Boswell and Trail posted several bizarre videos online in which they addressed reports about their possible involvement in Loofe’s disappearance.

“I’ve never killed anyone in my life and I’ve never hurt a female in my life, so take that for whatever the hell that’s worth,” Trail says in one of the videos. “The officers in this investigation have the people of Wilbur scared to death.”

He adds, ”[I’m] not saying I’m a nice guy. I’m a crook. I’m a thief. Have been all my life. OK? But I’m not what you’re trying to make me out to be.”

In the same video, Boswell insists she had nothing to do with Loofe’s disappearance. She acknowledges she’d gone on a couple of Tinder dates with Loofe, during which she claims they drove around and smoked marijuana, but says she last saw her on Nov. 15 ― the night of their second date.

“I went to take her home, and she asked me to drop her off at a friend’s house,” Boswell says. “And I did so. I gave her my number ... I haven’t heard from her since.”

Taney County Jail Aubrey Trail, left, and Bailey Boswell have been arrested in Missouri on charges unrelated to Sydney Loofe's disappearance.

Trail accuses the Lincoln Police Department of publicly smearing them and chasing them around “like dogs.” He denies rumors that the pair sold Loofe to human traffickers.

“It’s ridiculous,” he says. “I am not a pedophile. I like adults. Females ― 20s, 30s ― so sue me. I’m an old, horny guy. So what?”

The first video ends with Boswell flipping off the camera.

“I wish the family the best, I mean no disrespect to anyone and as far as the police department, fuck you,” Trail says.

YouTube A screen capture from the video.

Bliemeister said detectives are looking into Boswell’s and Trail’s claims. Earlier this week, they drained a pond and searched an area in Wilber, where Loofe’s cellphone last pinged a tower. Wilber is about 40 miles southwest of Lincoln. The searches were reportedly conducted not far from an apartment Trail rented.

The police chief said both searches failed to produce evidence in the case. The FBI is now assisting Lincoln police.

“We are applying all of our resources to help bring Sydney home,” said Randy Thysse, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Omaha. “We are doing our best as a law enforcement team to pursue any and all leads related to this investigation.”

Syndey’s father, George, also spoke at Thursday’s news conference.

“Someone knows something,” he said. “Please do the right thing.”

facebookcom/FindingSydneyLoofe Sydney Loofe shared this photo prior to her disappearance.

Loofe grew up in Neligh, a small city in Antelope County. She graduated from Neligh-Oakdale High School, where her father is the principal and her mother is a special education teacher.

The middle of three children, Loofe is described by her mother as a responsible young adult. Loofe loves spending time with family, adores her kitty, Nimzy, and enjoys fishing. She has worked at Menards in Lincoln for several years. The home improvement store is where Loofe landed when she decided college wasn’t for her, Susie Loofe said.

In fact, it was when Loofe failed to show up to Menards for work on Nov. 16 that people began to suspect something was wrong. It was out of character for Loofe to miss work, especially without calling.

The family has since posted thousands of flyers throughout the community and is asking people to join the Finding Sydney Loofe Facebook page. They’re also seeking additional volunteers to put up posters. Anyone interested in participating can email them at findingsydneyloofe@gmail.com.

Asked by a reporter Thursday if investigators still have hope that they’ll find Loofe alive, Bliemeister said, “Yes. Absolutely.”

“That’s what we’re hoping too,” Susie Loofe told HuffPost on Friday.

Sydney Loofe is described as a white female, 5 feet, 7 inches, and 130 pounds. She has blond hair and blue eyes. She has a yin-yang tattoo on one of her forearms, the word “Believe” with a cross on the inside of her left wrist and the phrase “Everything will be wonderful someday” on her right bicep. She was last seen wearing a white Columbia-brand jacket and a cream-colored shirt.

The Home Office told Satbir Singh, 30, on Friday it was wrong to deny his Indian wife Gitanjali, 31, a visa, after Singh wrote a widely read blog about his pain and anger about their initial refusal three days earlier. “My wife is coming home because you gave me a platform to tell the world what is being done to people,” he told HuffPost. “I’m incredibly grateful... but this isn’t how government is supposed to work.” Singh added: “I find it outrageous this is how errors are brought to their attention. Most people can’t do this. Most people can’t wrote something for the Huffington Post and bring pressure to bear. They shouldn’t have to.”

Satbir Singh Satbir and Gitanjali Singh on their wedding day in London in 2014

It has been a whirlwind week for the couple. Singh learned on Monday the Home Office had reached a decision. He was so sure she would be coming to London he ordered a “Welcome Home” banner off Amazon. On Tuesday, he received the rejection. He said it left him “in shock”. He was sure it was a mistake in processing their 11,000-page application and defining his income to assess whether he earned the £18,600 Britons must if they want to bring a spouse from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). On Wednesday, he picked up the keys to the Kilburn flat they were due to rent together. “As a husband, I am broken,” he wrote that day in his blog.

I find it outrageous this is how errors are brought to their attention. Satbir Singh

“The [Home Office] has overlooked or misplaced key documents and declared that we have failed to submit them. “They have applied the incorrect sections of the law and declared that we fail to satisfy them, and all this with almost complete impunity. Four different lawyers have confirmed that the Home Office has made a mistake.” Their lawyer had told them an appeal could take up to a year. The lawyer had been due to respond to the Home Office on Monday. But on Friday, two days after his blog was published, Singh said he received an automated email acknowledging the mistake and apologising. The Home Office does not comment on individual cases but confirmed it had reversed its original decision. The couple met studying at SOAS in London in 2010 and were married in 2014.

They moved to America where Satbir Singh pursued a scholarship to study Gitanjali Singh worked for the Clinton Health Access Initiative. But her visa forced her to leave Washington for Delhi in September 2016, the last time the couple lived together. “It is a year that has seen us forced to live on opposite sides of the world, in different time zones and climates, each of us stealing moments at odd hours to be there on the phone when the other one woke up or went to sleep,” Satbir Singh wrote in his blog. He returned to Britain in January and worked freelance as a human rights consultant until September, when he became chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which campaigns against the visa rules. The transition from self-employment complicated their visa application, which requires evidence of six months’ earnings. She had stayed in her job, working remotely, and the visa application included the fact this work would continue when she came to Britain. But, in such cases, the spouse’s income does not count if they are working abroad.-1

Meet Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow.

He's a candidate running in the federal election for the Science Party in the seat of Grayndler against Labor MP Anthony Albanese.

Yes. His name is actually Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow. Legally, and everything.

Meow-Meow will get to experience the certain novelty that comes with having your name printed on the election ballot paper on July 2 and people discover who you are.

But he wants to let you know that the campaign he's running goes beyond the novelty of his name.

The Huffington Post Australia spoke to Mr Meow-Meow and started with the obvious question: what's with the name?

"I was name agnostic. I thought it would be a really interesting experience to change your name because not many people have that experience," he said.

"I sat down with a group of friends and made a list of names that sounded fun and then we thought of which ones rolled off the tongue the nicest and we came up with one that we thought was novel and fun and I changed it."

Favourite candidate name. Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow Meow (Science Party) in Grayndler — Antony Green (@AntonyGreenABC) June 10, 2016

But Meow-Meow's credentials and political perspective extend beyond his interesting name. He is a molecular biologist, entrepreneur and futurist who believes in the pairing of scientific research and technology, according to his candidate page on the Science Party's website.

"My background is in genetics, and I think that the biggest things that I'm bringing are an evidence based approach to policy," he told HuffPost Australia.

"The reason I'm in politics is because I looked at a lot of parties that are making policies based on ideology but not looking at facts. Being a scientist, that's really distressing."

Meow-Meow believes the actions of past governments and cuts to science funding has made growth in Australia more difficult for the future.

"All of the problems in the world at the moment are solvable through science but when you've got parties cutting funding to the CSIRO that makes that difficult," he said.

"I think we're forward looking at emerging technologies that bring policies to government that can affect Australia and the entire world and we need to look at them now before they become a problem and make sure they're regulated properly."

Meow-Meow is also an adviser to a nutritional infant formula startup company called BioNascent and claims the lack of attention paid to science by policy makers is the reason why the Science Party has candidates promoting technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and nuclear power.

"In the 1970s and 1980s we were a country that prided ourselves on technology and now we've become a population where you're seeing a large amount of racism and we're being turned away from intellectuals and that's not the vision for Australia that I have," he said.

"We're going to listen to scientists, we're going to make that the top priority. All it takes is finding something we do really well and telling the rest of the world that we do that."

Whether it be his interesting name or approach to policy, Meow-Meow is ambitious about furthering the Science Party's cause.

"I think that the human brain flies on novelty. We see this all over the place, we see it in advertising, we see it in our sex lives, this is a way for people to take notice of the Science Party," he said.

"If people see my name and read about the Science Party policy, then that's fantastic. I've copped a lot of criticism, but if that's the worst thing people are saying about me then we're doing alright."1
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/news/economy/obamacare-senate-individual-mandate/index.htmlSenate may strengthen Obamacare even as it kills individual mandateSenate Republicans are poised to seriously wound Obamacare by eliminating the individual mandate as part of the tax bill.

But at the same time lawmakers may actually strengthen the health reform law to woo some key party votes, particularly Maine Senator Susan Collins, who helped defeat the Senate's more comprehensive Obamacare repeal bill this summer.

Collins is pushing the stalled bipartisan Obamacare stabilization bill as a counterbalance to the repeal of the individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. She's also advocating for a bill she co-authored with Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida that aims to lower insurance premiums on the exchanges by helping insurers cover their costliest patients.

The moderate senator said Thursday these provisions will "most likely" be included in the upcoming continuing resolution to temporarily fund the federal government. She noted Friday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell "committed to support passage" of the bills before the end of the year.

Related: Here's what's in the Senate tax bill

Since the Senate and House would still have to agree on a joint tax bill in conference committee, Collins has time to see whether the two Obamacare measures are passed in the spending bill.

"So I'm going to know whether or not those provisions made it and that matters hugely to me," she said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday, adding she's primarily concerned about the increase in premiums that could result from ending the mandate.

The elimination of the mandate could increase premiums by 10% and could leave 13 million more people without coverage over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But it could also prompt healthy people to forgo coverage, leaving mostly sicker people in Obamacare policies. This, in turn, could make insurers flee the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which would rock the individual market.

The stabilization bill, co-authored by Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Washington Democratic Senator Patty Murray, calls for funding Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction payments for two years. In October, President Trump ended federal support for these subsidies, which help lower-income enrollees pay for medical care. The elimination of this funding prompted insurers to raise premiums for 2018 since they must still provide the subsidies.

Meanwhile, Collins said Friday her bill would appropriate $5 billion in 2018 and in 2019 to help states create state-based reinsurance programs that would help insurers pay for high-cost patients. (The original Collins-Nelson bill introduced earlier this year would have appropriated $2.25 billion each of those years.)

"The combination of those two bills would more than than offset the premium increase that would be caused by [repealing the individual mandate]," Collins said at the breakfast.

Related: Obamacare enrollment could fall millions short for 2018

But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and health policy experts don't agree.

The CBO issued a report Wednesday that said that passing the Alexander-Murray bill will not substantially change the impact of repealing the mandate.

And health policy experts have questioned whether Collins' bill would help reduce premiums long-term since it only provides funding for two years.

An even bigger question is whether either of these bills will actually become law. Conservative House Republicans said earlier this week that they would not support the Alexander-Murray bill, which they called a bailout for insurance companies.1
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/02/technology/elon-musk-spacex-falcon-heavy-launch/index.htmlElon Musk will send his Tesla Roadster to Mars on a giant rocketElon Musk says the first test launch of SpaceX's massive new rocket will happen next month.

Its destination? Mars.

Its cargo? A Tesla Roadster with David Bowie on the stereo.

The rocket, known as the Falcon Heavy, will lift off from Cape Canaveral, using the same launchpad as Apollo 11, Musk tweeted late Friday in the U.S.

"Will have double thrust of next largest rocket," he said. "Guaranteed to be exciting, one way or another."

Falcon Heavy to launch next month from Apollo 11 pad at the Cape. Will have double thrust of next largest rocket. Guaranteed to be exciting, one way or another. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 2, 2017

SpaceX has revolutionized the rocket industry, but it has also suffered spectacular setbacks over the years, including rockets blowing up on the launchpad and in flight.

Related: Elon Musk is aiming to land spaceships on Mars in 2022

Musk, the CEO of both SpaceX and electric car company Tesla (TSLA), said the Falcon Heavy would be launched with the aim of putting its payload in orbit around Mars.

The rocket's rather unorthodox cargo will be Musk's own "midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity," he said, referring to Bowie's classic song.

It will, Musk predicted, "be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent."

Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesn't blow up on ascent. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 2, 2017

As with pretty much all timetables announced by Musk, the launch date could still change. SpaceX and Tesla have a long track record of missing the CEO's ambitious deadlines.

SpaceX originally hoped to carry out the first Falcon Heavy test launch years ago. And Musk said earlier this year he was targeting November.

Related: SpaceX's playbook: Make history, then make more history

Musk's announcement of the planned launch of the giant rocket comes just over two months after he outlined his vision for eventually putting humans on Mars and colonizing the planet.

That project will require an even larger rocket, though. It's called the BFR, or Big Falcon Rocket, which inside the company is nicknamed the "Big F--king Rocket."

SpaceX plans to start building the first of those by the middle of next year, Musk said in late September.

He wants to land at least two of the spacecraft on Mars in 2022 carrying equipment -- and then ones transporting people in 2024.

In the meantime, the Falcon Heavy is intended to boost the amount of cargo SpaceX can take into space for its customers. The company says it will be able to take into orbit more than twice the payload -- 119,000 pounds -- of its closest rival at a third of the cost.

SpaceX has shaken up the aerospace industry by dramatically slashing costs and developing rockets that can blast out of the atmosphere and then come back down to land on a barge floating in the middle of the ocean.

Traditionally, rockets have been used just once, and are left to burn up in the atmosphere after a mission. But SpaceX has been working for years to change that.

It has said that reused rockets will be a part of the maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy, which is essentially three Falcon 9 rockets, the company's current workhorse, strapped together.1

The earthquake was initially reported as a 5.1 magnitude, and then a 4.4 magnitude, but USGS has revised their original information.

Although it was centered near Dover, WJZ has received many reports of people feeling the ground shake throughout Maryland, including in Baltimore, Jessup and Pasadena. It was also felt to the north of Delaware, as far away as Rockway Park, New York.

“It is pretty unusual to have an earthquake of this size in this area,” says Julie Dutton of USGS. “It’s not typical… There are actually several faults throughout the east coast. There’s not as common to have earthquakes in that area, but there are a lot of faults that do have the potential for earthquakes, so it’s not that completely unheard of.”

As for aftershocks, “there’s always the potential for aftershocks, but typically in this area you have one main shock and not many aftershocks,” Dutton adds.

“It just felt like a train going by, but there aren’t any trains around here,” said Gustavo Vila, an Anne Arundel County resident. “I lived in Sacramento for years so I’ve felt them before. That’s what it was, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. That was weird, I’ve never felt one here before!”

“My husband and I were sitting in Subway and we felt the floor move, but we weren’t exactly sure what it was,” another woman told WJZ. “And he said he thought my foot was bouncing and I said no, I don’t think my foot could move the floor that much. But yeah, we felt it inside. It was mild.”

Back in 2011, another rare earthquake rocked the region. The epicenter of that 5.8 quake was in Virginia. It caused damage to the Washington Monument.

Maryland also had two smaller quakes in the last month.

“Lots of times we hear about fault lines over in the California region where we have multiple plates coming together and going underneath each other, that’s not what we have in Maryland now,” said state geologist Richard Ortt of the Maryland Geological Survey. “You can think of Maryland more of a one sheet continental plate and there are some weaknesses within that plate.”

http://miami.cbslocal.com/2017/12/01/police-investigate-deadly-shooting-on-palmetto-expressway/Road Rage Leads To Deadly Shooting On Palmetto ExpresswayFollow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter

NORTHWEST MIAMI-DADE (CBSMiami) – Road rage is being blamed for a deadly shooting on State Road 826/Palmetto Expressway in Northwest Miami-Dade.

It’s not clear what prompted the violent incident between the driver of a black Nissan and a semi-tractor trailer but when it was over, the driver of the tractor trailer was dead.

CBS4 was on the scene as a man was taken into custody and taken away by police for questioning at Miami-Dade Police headquarters.

Late Friday afternoon, Miami-Dade Police Det. Alvaro Zabaleta made a special plea to the public. He said police were having trouble finding the gun that was used.

“It may have ended up on a passing vehicle,” he said. “We just don’t know. That’s why we need help from the public.”

Zabaleta is urging anyone who has found the weapon to call Miami-Dade Police or Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers.

CBS4 has learned that the tractor trailer was owned by D.M. Express of St. John, Indiana in the northwest part of the state. A spokeswoman for the company told CBS4’s Peter D’Oench that she the driver of the tractor trailer was not from Indiana. She was not certain what he was delivering.

In video from Chopper4 over the scene, the body of the victim could be seen under a yellow tarp on the southbound exit ramp to NW 25th Street. Neither he nor the driver of the tractor trailer have been identified.

“The driver of the tractor trailer did exit the vehicle and walk toward a black Nissan. The driver of the Nissan got out,” said Zabaleta. “There was a physical confrontation between both of them. We’re being told the driver of the tractor trailer was armed with a knife during the confrontation and that’s when the driver of Nissan produced a firearm and shot the victim in this case. This is road rage that lead to this shooting.”

Zabaleta said it is not known if this was a case of self-defense. He said police would be receiving input from the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office.

“Just like any Florida statute you have to have elements of the crime in order to be able to charge that crime so we have to wait and see and get the story from the shooter. We have to hear from witnesses as to what occurred. We have to look at the evidence and the totality of the circumstances and work with the State Attorney’s Office,” said Zabaleta.

Friday night, police scoured the expressway ramp with the help of a man involved in the deadly road rage incident. Police are hoping the man can help them find the gun he allegedly used on the driver of the semi.

The Florida Highway Patrol wants to educate the public about road rage.

“There is no need for confrontations, avoid traffic confrontations as much as you can,” said FHP spokesman Joe Sanchez. “If someone blows a horn at you, ignore it, continue. These incidents at times result in people getting injured and at times, people even losing their lives.”

Sanchez added, “Just avoid confrontations. Believe me. It will save us a lot of work and lives will be saved.”

Zabaleta said it’s a particular concern around the holidays.

“This is something that we must educate our community about, especially during the holidays where there is going to be a lot of traffic around the area and the malls. We have to be calm. Now we have a case where someone has lost his life and loved ones are not going to have that person for the holidays and coworkers are not going to have a person around either. This is a case of what can happen because of road rage.”

One person has been taken into custody for questioning.

Late Friday afternoon, Miami-Dade Police detectives returned to the exit ramp with him as they continued their investigation.

Police are also urging witnesses to come forward and call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS (8477) if they have any information on this case.

The off-ramp heading south toward Northwest 25th Street remained closed for 6 hours and reopened around 3:25 p.m.-2

http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/hunter-kills-600-pound-bear/Man Bags Monster 600-Pound Bear; One Of The Biggest During Current Pa. Hunting SeasonFollow KDKA-TV: Facebook | Twitter

RAYBURN TOWNSHIP (KDKA) — A hunter from our area bagged one of the biggest bears taken during this year’s season in Pennsylvania. It was 600 pounds and seven-feet tall.

“I would have taken a small one for my first one, but I can’t complain about a 600-pounder,” said 25-year-old Bo Bowser, of Rayburn Township in Armstrong County.

He grew up in a hunting family and last week after 13 years of trying, he bagged his first bear in Valley Township.

“He was down by a creek, so it was nice and loud,” said Bowser. “I was able to sneak up on him.”

When the bear turned around and looked at him, Bowser’s reaction was: “Whoa!”

It took four shots to take down the bear, and it was only after it was down that Bowser truly realized its size.

“If we had shot him anywhere deep in the woods, we wouldn’t have been able to get him out,” said Bowser.

They slowly floated the bear across the creek and then called in help to get him to their ATV. Friends and Bowser’s dad all pitched in.

“Five guys, 45 minutes to drag it 15 yards,” he said.

He gave the meat to some friends, and now it’s at a taxidermist while he figures out whether to have it mounted, which could cost $3,000.

“You can’t just put it in the corner of your living room,” said Bowser. “It would take up some serious space.”

As for next bear season, Bowser says he’ll be back at it, but will keep his expectations in check.

“Of course, definitely,” said Bowser. “I mean, I’ll never shoot a 600-pounder again. But, like I said, sometimes luck is on your side.”

While the Game Commission says this was one the biggest bears taken this season, it was not the biggest. The biggest was in Venango County at 700 pounds!0

FARMERSVILLE, Tx. - If you`ve driven by the Farmersville Fire Department in the last few weeks - you might have noticed Vicki!

'It`s more about supporting the women and not the cause."

Farmersville firefighter Kevin Lisman, and Vicki, are part of the non profit Collin county Chapter of The Pink Heals national tour. It started about 10 years ago and is focused on supporting those in need.

"It`s gotten so big and busy that they`ve allowed certain counties and all that if they want to to start up their own chapter," says Lisman. "We work with the local fire departments and all that, we show up lights and sirens, make a lot of noise and surprise the person [...] we let people sign the truck if you`ve been affected by cancer of had a family member or anybody that you know close that has been affected by cancer you sign the truck in remembrance of them, some of the signatures have faded into the truck, as they fade into it they become a part of that truck and just stay with it forever."

But for Kevin - this isn`t just about marker on a vehicle.

"Well, my wife is a six year breast cancer survivor so it`s personal to us," says Lisman.

So last summer - before the Collin County chapter formed - she met "a Vicki."

"She`s seen this for several years and she`s always wanted to do it so," says Lisman, "We surprised her at the school with it and it`s really neat."

So if someone you know would like a surprise visit from Vicki - you have through this weekend to catch it in Farmersville.2
http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/chicago-man-trapping-cats/Chicago Man Trapping Cats Hopes To Get City’s AttentionCHICAGO (CBS) — A Chicago man, who has trapped more than 40 cats this week, was back at it on Thursday.

Chicago’s Animal Care and Control (CACC) asked Disgrace Felyer to stop, and even issued a warning to cat owners, or those who care for feral cat colonies, to keep their feline friends indoors.

Felyer, however, told CBS 2’s Charlie De Mar he has no intentions of stopping.

He baits the cats with food, then brings all those he’s captured to the shelter on Western Avenue. Wednesday night, he dropped off about 10 cats; he brought in about 15 on both Monday and Tuesday.

Felyer says the city could be doing more to tackle the cat population on the West and South Sides, and that the traps are an effort to get his point across.

Animal Care and Control asked him to stop trapping neighborhood cats and dropping them off. It’s putting pressure on the shelter and pets are being brought in. Today, he was at it again. @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/Cm9VcoRpYO — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) November 30, 2017

“Please leave them where they are. Usually they will go home,” Susan Russell said, executive director of Animal Care and Control. She added that many of the cats are in good health, and fears some Felyer has brought in might be pets. “Many of them do not look injured — many of them look perfectly fine,” she added.

Felyer runs the not-for-profit Snowball Animal Welfare out of his home on the West Side. And there’s no shortage of cats.

Margaret Leach, Felyer’s neighbor, said, “No, it doesn’t smell good, especially in the summer time. The stench reportedly makes it “unbearable” to sit on the front porch.

Tree House Humane Society, a no kill, humane, organization, issued a statement that said, in part: “The strategy he is using is inappropriate for the population of cats he’s trapping. His tactics , while well intentioned, are flawed.”

Animal Care and Control may have been called to Felyer’s home, but could not provide immediate details of the visit. Neighbors said they have also gone to the alderman about the cats.

http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/child-almost-abducted/Child Almost Abducted With Father Standing Next To HimHALTOM CITY, Texas (CBS11) – Haltom City Police are looking for a man they said tried to abduct a 2-year-old boy with the child’s dad standing right next to him.

Investigators said the dad was walking his trash can to the curb with his son on Tuesday near 3900 Janrue Court when a man ran up from the creek near their backyard.

The man tugged on the boy’s arm as the dad held on tight and yelled.

“Oh..It’s terrible,” said the dad who did not want to be identified to protect his son.

Neighbor Elias Holguin said he saw it all.

“He was like right here trying to open a bag of chips. I’m already walking off to the other side of the house and I just hear him scream to help,” said Holguin.

The father said when he yelled for police, the man ran away.

“We have no idea what his motives were, why he picked that child,” said Haltom City Detective Matthew Spillane.

Officers set up a perimeter and used K9s to search the heavily wooded area, but they found no one.

“It’s extremely scary to have a person still out there free, that could possibly do this to another child,” said Spillane.

What worries Spillane is that the man went after the child with his dad standing right next to him.

“It’s extremely unusual. I haven’t heard of a case,” said Spillane.

The boy’s father said he only wants to protect his family and for it not to happen to anyone else in the area.

Police said they only have a very vague description of the suspect.-1
http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/twin-cities-sandwich-man-helps-homeless/Twin Cities Man Spends Days Delivering Sandwiches To HomelessMINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — One Twin Cities man spends 365 nights a year on the streets.

He delivers sandwiches, coats and bus tokens every day. You may have heard of Allan Law – also known as the “Sandwich Man.”

More than two million people have watched a viral video following him around one winter night. The retired teacher says he believes God put him on the earth to help the homeless.

As Susan-Elizabeth Littlefield shows us, now – someone else is trying to help him.

“My neighbors see me rolling the grocery cart up and down, moving 700 sandwiches at a time, going out about 8 o’clock,” Law said.

This is ground zero for Allan Law’s mission. His apartment has 20 freezers. It’s ground zero for his charity, “Love One Another.”

He also uses four storage units. Each packed to the brim with snacks, blankets and gifts for the kids.

“I’ve got in here about 40 stuffed animals like this,” Law said.

“He’s just such a hero that would be I guess how I would explain him,” Teri Bennett of Excelsior said.

Bennett heard about the sandwiches a few years back, and started volunteering. She realized Allan is in need, too.

“He said, ‘I need a warehouse.’ I said ‘Ok, I don’t have one of those,” Bennett said.

But she does have a computer, and a son who helped her start a GoFundMe.

“I let the budget at $15,000, which clearly that wouldn’t cover everything. I hope it’s a hundred times that,” Law said.

“What would it be like to have your own warehouse? It would be beautiful as far as convenience and a place I could meet with a group of people,” Law said.

Allan’s charity is turning 50. He’s never asked anyone to write a check, but sometimes when you pay it forward, it comes back.

“Let’s just blow the socks off it. I just think it should be the hugest anniversary present ever,” Bennett said.

If the GoFundMe raises enough money, Allan also dreams of getting a larger van one day so he can help many more people.2

The family of Sydney Loofe made the announcement Monday night on a Facebook page they’d created to help raise awareness about Loofe’s disappearance.

“It’s with heavy hearts that we share this most recent update with you all,” the message reads. “Please continue to pray for Sydney and our entire family. May God grant eternal rest unto thee. We love you Sydney.”

The Antelope County Sheriff’s Office also shared the news on its official Facebook page, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Loofe family … No other details are known at this time.”

The FBI is expected to release more details at a press conference scheduled for 8:45 a.m. (9:45 a.m. EDT) Tuesday.

Loofe, of Lincoln, was last heard from by her family on Nov. 15. That evening, she went on a second date with a woman she’d met online. The woman she was last seen with, 23-year-old Bailey Boswell, admitted she was with Loofe in the hours before she was reported missing, police said.

Boswell, of Wilber, was arrested last week in an unrelated drug case. Her roommate, 51-year-old Aubrey Trail, was also picked up on a charge unrelated to Loofe’s disappearance. Authorities said Trail faces a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person.

Prior to their arrests, Boswell and Trail posted several bizarre videos online in which they addressed reports about their possible involvement in Loofe’s disappearance.

“I’ve never killed anyone in my life and I’ve never hurt a female in my life, so take that for whatever the hell that’s worth,” Trail says in one of the videos.

Despite being named “persons of interest” by authorities, investigators have not filed charges against Boswell or Trail in Loofe’s disappearance.

The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria.

Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that none of the 626,000 Rohingya who have fled violence to Bangladesh since August should be repatriated to Myanmar unless there was robust monitoring on the ground.

Myanmar’s ambassador, Htin Lynn, said his government was working with Bangladesh to ensure returns of the displaced in about two months and “there will be no camps.”

Zeid, who has described the campaign in the past as a “textbook case of ethnic cleansing,” was addressing a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council called by Bangladesh.

Paula Bronstein via Getty Images A Rohingya girl cries as refugees fleeing from Myanmar cross a stream in the hot sun on a muddy rice field on October 16, 2017 near Palang Khali, Cox Bazar, Bangladesh.

He described reports of “acts of appalling barbarity committed against the Rohingya, including deliberately burning people to death inside their homes, murders of children and adults; indiscriminate shooting of fleeing civilians; widespread rapes of women and girls, and the burning and destruction of houses, schools, markets and mosques.”

“Can anyone - can anyone - rule out that elements of genocide may be present?” he told the 47-member state forum.

Shahriar Alam, Bangladesh’s junior foreign affairs minister, told the session in Geneva that his country was hosting nearly one million “Myanmar nationals” following summary executions and rapes “as a weapon of persecution.”

Mainly Buddhist Myanmar denies the Muslim Rohingya are its citizens and considers them foreigners.

These crimes had been “perpetrated by Myanmar security forces and extremist Buddhist vigilantes,” Alam said, calling for an end to what he called “xenophobic rhetoric..including from higher echelons of the government and the military.”

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

Zeid urged the Council to recommend that the U.N. General Assembly establish a new mechanism “to assist individual criminal investigations of those responsible.”

Prosecutions for the violence and rapes against Rohingya by security forces and civilians “appear extremely rare,” he said.

Marzuki Darusman, head of an independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said by video from Malaysia: “We will go where the evidence leads us.”

His team has interviewed Rohingya refugees, including children in the Bangladeshi port city of Cox’s Bazar, who recounted “acts of extreme brutality” and “displayed signs of severe trauma.”

Myanmar has not granted the investigators access to Rakhine, the northern state from which the Rohingya have fled, Darusman said. “We maintain hope that it will be granted early in 2018.”

Pramila Patten, special envoy of the U.N. Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict, who interviewed survivors in Bangladesh in November, said: “I heard the most heart-breaking and horrific accounts of sexual atrocities reportedly committed in cold blood out of a lethal hatred of these people solely on the basis of their ethnicity and religion.”

Crimes included “rape, gang rape by multiple soldiers, forced public nudity and humiliation, and sexual slavery in military captivity,” Patten said.

Myanmar denies committing atrocities against the Rohingya. Its envoy Htin, referring to the accounts, said: “People will say what they wanted to believe and sometimes they will say what they were told to say.”

Kelley Currie, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social Council, said the Rohingya’s lack of Myanmar citizenship was “the fundamental root cause of this crisis,” adding: “Stop denying the seriousness of the current situation.”-1

But it all began with a same-sex couple who just wanted a special wedding cake.

In 2012, Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips pointed to his conservative Christian beliefs in refusing to make a custom wedding cake for Colorado couple Charlie Craig and David Mullins.

Phillips argues that when he designs his custom cakes, he is an artist and that he can’t be forced to use his artistic expression to send a message he finds religiously objectionable ― in this case, that any marriage other than one between a man and a woman should be celebrated. His lawyers say it is a matter of free speech.

The Trump administration has taken up the baker’s cause. “Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,” the Justice Department wrote in an amicus brief filed in September.

But in refusing to make Craig and Mullins a custom cake, Phillips violated Colorado anti-discrimination law that prohibits businesses from denying services to people based on sexual orientation, among other factors. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled against him in May 2014.

Several court decisions later, the case has reached the Supreme Court ― with the scope of free speech and anti-discrimination protections on the line.

The implications of Phillips’ claim that he should be able to deny the couple services based on his free speech rights as a Christian are “staggering,” American Civil Liberties Union attorneys representing Craig and Mullins wrote in a brief filed last year.

“People hold religious beliefs about a wide variety of things, including racial and

religious segregation and the role of women in society,” the ACLU lawyers wrote. “If religious motivation exempted businesses from anti-discrimination laws, government would be powerless to protect all Americans from the harms of invidious discrimination.”

The brief noted another religious freedom case, which came before the Supreme Court in 1968, revolving around a South Carolina barbecue chain that had refused to serve two black customers. Maurice Bessinger, the owner of Piggie Park, argued that he was legally justified in refusing service to black customers inside his restaurants due to his religious belief that there should not be “any integration of the races whatsoever.”

At the trial court level, U.S. District Judge Charles Earl Simons Jr. was not persuaded by that argument. He wrote: “Undoubtedly defendant Bessinger has a constitutional right to espouse the religious beliefs of his own choosing, however, he does not have the absolute right to exercise and practice such beliefs in utter disregard of the clear constitutional rights of other citizens.”

By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, it was a debate about lawyers’ fees, but the justices still ruled against Bessinger, calling his religious freedom defense “patently frivolous.”

The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund also held up that long-ago case in its amicus brief filed on behalf of Craig and Mullins: “The logic of Piggie Park and other precedents overwhelmingly rejecting religious justifications for racial discrimination apply squarely to the context of LGBTQ discrimination.”

But the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Phillips, argues there is a difference between his case and those earlier disputes. Phillips’ bakery serves “people of all races, all faiths, all sexual orientations, and all walks of life,” the alliance wrote, and he had offered to sell Craig and Mullins a pre-made cake. He only refused to make them a custom cake, which Phillips’s lawyers said he has the right to do as a matter of artistic expression and free speech.

LGBTQ advocates reject the idea that freedom of speech and artistic expression are what’s at stake in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The real issue here is the ability of ordinary commercial businesses to use religion to pick and choose which parts of anti-discrimination law they’ll obey.

“While the work that many people do is beautiful, businesses that sell products to the general public are not above the law just because there may be a creative element to their work,” Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, said in a statement to HuffPost.

Phillips defended his decision at a recent rally, telling his supporters, “I don’t create custom designs for events or messages that conflict with my conscience.” Among the other celebrations and messages he said he wouldn’t bake for are “Halloween, bachelor or bachelorette parties, and anti-American cakes.”

Opponents of same-sex marriage have increasingly used religious freedom arguments to try to justify the refusal of services to LGBTQ people. Even with same-sex marriage now legal in all 50 states, some conservative Christians have argued they should be granted religious accommodations when they feel that serving gay couples would violate their beliefs.

Where those Christians argue that their faith is under attack, advocates for the LGBTQ community say they are the ones whose lives and livelihoods are at risk.

Already this year, LGBTQ rights have been compromised by several policy changes from the White House. In August, President Donald Trump proposed a ban on transgender individuals entering the military ― a plan that was shortly thereafter blocked by a district court. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo in October reversing workplace protections for transgender employees on the basis of “religious freedom.”-1

The America First Action super PAC also said it would spend $1.1 million to help elect Moore ahead of the Dec. 12 special election, according to The Washington Post.

Trump sent out a tweet in support of Moore on Monday, calling his opponent, Democrat Doug Jones, a “Pelosi/Schumer Puppet,” ending an unusual streak of relative silence on the issue.

“We need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama,” Trump wrote. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more.”

I look forward to fighting alongside the President to #MAGA! — Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) December 4, 2017

Moore has been accused by multiple women of making unwanted advances toward them when they were teenagers and he was in their 30s. In an interview with The Washington Post, one woman said Moore molested her when she was 14 in 1979.

Moore has vehemently denied the allegations and moved to discredit his accusers, calling the reports a politically motivated attack.

“People have waited until four weeks prior to the general election to bring their complaints,” Moore said during a campaign event in November. “That’s not a coincidence ― it’s an intentional act to stop a campaign.”

Despite the recent support from the White House, some Republicans have called for others in the party to continue to distance themselves from Moore. On Monday, former presidential nominee Mitt Romney called Moore “a stain on the GOP.”

“No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity,” he said.-1

Heller’s former band Dresses performed with Martinez in 2014 at a show in Nashville. She’s since become a solo artist, dropping her first single in October.

Martinez is one of the few success stories from the NBC reality singing competition, placing in the Top 6 during the series’ third season. She went on to release her debut studio album, “Cry Baby,” in 2015, which spawned the hit single “Pity Party.”

A post shared by Melanie Martinez (@littlebodybigheart) on Feb 14, 2017 at 3:34pm PST

The singer responded to Heller’s account early Tuesday morning, saying that she is “horrified and saddened” by her statements.

“What she and I shared was a close friendship for a period of time. We came into each other’s lives as we were both starting our careers as artists, and we tried to help each other,” Martinez wrote on Twitter. “We both had pain in dealing with our individual demons and the new paths we were forging, but I truly felt we were trying to lift each other up. She never said no to what we chose to do together. And although we parted ways, I am sending her love and light always.”

Heller said she initially didn’t intend to name her alleged abuser, but chose to come forward in the wake of the sexual assault stories that have come to light over the past few months.-1

From blockbuster multi-day camping festivals down to small, niche events, pounding dance music to delicate acoustic acts, there's something on offer for basically all tastes, ages and demographics if you know where to look.

But of course, locking yourself into going to a festival isn't just about the music itself. Getting there, the journey, is often half the fun -- packing up the car, piling in with your mates, and hitting the open road with the sun at your back and the wind in your hair, checking out funny little towns along the way and creating a bunch of memories before you even step foot in the festival grounds. With the great Australian roadtrip in mind, here's a few amazing festivals that you'll love travelling to almost as much as you'll love attending.

Fairgrounds Festival, Berry, NSW – 8 + 9 December

One of Australia's newest and cutest festivals is Fairgrounds, in the little town of Berry on the NSW south coast. It's a town most known for its quaint community markets, and a little doughnut van that somehow everyone in the state knows about, but Berry is fast becoming known for this December festival which has hosted the likes of heavyweight indie acts Jagwar Ma, Japandroids, The Drones, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard and Father John Misty since its inception in 2015. This year will see synthpop kings Client Liaison, groovy indie band Future Islands, rising blues act The Teskey Brothers and beloved outfit The Shins take over the showgrounds on December 8 and 9. Fairgrounds is just two hours' drive from both Sydney and Canberra, the perfect distance for a short road trip, and close to the beach and hinterlands.

The festival also offers amazing food and drink -- including an oyster bar -- family games, a picturesque camping site set on a riverbank, and even a pool.

Inland Sea of Sound, Bathurst, NSW - 3 + 4 November

From the sea to the mountains, Bathurst's Inland Sea of Sound is another boutique event for the older, more discerning music fan. Headlined by Bernard Fanning, Meg Mac and Dan Sultan, the festival is set at the famous Mount Panorama race circuit. It's three hours driving from both Sydney and Canberra, with roadtrippers able to stop at the Blue Mountains National Park, Goulburn or Jenolan Caves along the way, depending on the route taken. A big selection of beers, burgers and cheese await those looking to indulge their stomachs as well as their ears at the music festival, while campers get to pitch their tent right at the top of the mountain.

NYE on the Hill, South Gippsland, Victoria – 30 Dec to 1 Jan

Already a firm favourite on the Victorian music calendar, NYE On The Hill takes place on a hill, on New Year's Eve, surprisingly. A 90-minute drive from Melbourne, the festival will feature Ball Park Music, Regurgitator, Gold Class, Gretta Ray and a swag of other rising talents to usher in 2018. NYE On The Hill takes place on a family farm, with rolling green hills. The area is also known for its beautiful sunsets, so much so that an entire page on the festival's website is devoted to pictures.

Lost Paradise, Glenworth Valley, NSW - NYE

For a different type of New Year's Eve, check out Lost Paradise, nestled secretly in the gorgeous Glenworth Valley on the NSW Central Coast. Less than two hours outside Sydney, the festival rests deep inside a lush valley between mountains, with picturesque scenery and a very convenient river to swim, lounge and cool down in. HuffPost Australia went in 2016, and found a giant party in the bush -- we called it like "a big backyard party spiralled out of control; in the best way possible". To usher in 2018, the biggest lineup yet includes Rufus, Matt Corby, DMA's, Little Dragon, Cut Copy and heaps more. Take a slow drive up, stop off at beautiful forests along the way or even detour out to the coast to check out beaches in northern Sydney or the Central Coast, and prepare for a very cool weekend.

Falls Festival - NYE

One of the senior statesmen of the Australian circuit, the Falls festivals are still going strong after more than 20 years. The New Year's Eve events take place in four locations nationwide, in Byron Bay, Lorne, Marion Bay and Fremantle. The 2017 edition will be headlined by Fleet Foxes, Angus and Julia Stone, Flume and The Kooks, with an impressive roster of other acts including Run The Jewels, Foster The People, Liam Gallagher and even Daryl 'Horses' Braithwaite.

The picturesque locations for each Falls instalment have long been a major drawcard for those who want to stretch their three-day festival experience into a week-long (or more) holiday up or down the coast, stopping off at beaches or little towns along the way. A few of the Falls dates have already sold out, but be quick and you might be able to get cracking on a festival road trip of your own.

Queenscliff Music Festival, Queenscliff, Victoria - November 24-26

For something a little different, check out QMF, focused on more eclectic and thoughtful acts. Situated in Queenscliff, Victoria, just outside Geelong, it's just a short drive from Melbourne and right on the coast. Take a drive down, see the sights on the way, then settle in for some good listening -- Bernard Fanning, The Bamboos, The Temper Trap, The Beautiful Girls and a special performance from members of Yothu Yindi are the standout headline acts, ably supported by a cast of up-and-comers like GL, Didirri and A.B. Original collaborator Caiti Baker.

Festival Of The Sun, Port Macquarie, NSW - December 7-9

Keen on the NSW north coast? Check out Festival of the Sun at Port Macquarie. Set in a caravan park within stone's throw of the beach, it's a chill, laidback vibe. Laze around in the pool or in the surf, catch a few bands (or waves), and crack into a few drinks -- it's even BYO booze. Acts on the bill include The Preatures, Horrorshow, Bad Dreems and Meg Mac, and besides that, you've got the beautiful and sunny north coast to check out on your way there or your way home.0

Forests or fuel? Agriculture or energy? Fresh water or fracking? Beauty or balance sheets? And are these things mutually exclusive, or can we maybe have it all?

These questions are all about to play out in Australia's largest inland native forest, the Pilliga, in northern New South Wales.

The Pilliga is not what you'd call a pretty forest. It has neither the lushness of the Daintree, nor the towering grandeur of West Australia's Karri forests or Victoria's mountain ash. In truth it's more like scrub -- a patchwork of scraggly ironbark, thin-stemmed eucalypts and a plain native pine called cypress pine.

The Pilliga's creekbeds are sandy and its roads throw up a powdery dust that turns everything Donald Trump orange. Its emus, koalas and glossy black cockatoos are elusive. There are few lookouts or landmarks of note. The rest areas beside the Newell Highway -- the main road from Brisbane to Melbourne which barrels right through the heart of it -- are devoid of picnickers.

It takes about two hours to drive from Sydney to Newcastle. That gives you a good indication of the vast scale of The Pilliga -- which is the large area of forest to the south of Narrabri.

The Pilliga is a place few people go to see, and which most people are in a hurry to get through. But the Pilliga is vast and quiet. And when you spend two days driving its rutted tracks, you come to understand that its unrelenting, undulating featurelessness is its very charm.

But for how long?

Shot this footage 2day of the INCREDIBLE Pilliga forest, Australia's largest dryland forest. It's threatened by a huge coal seam gas project pic.twitter.com/gP4bZxltTC — Anthony Sharwood (@antsharwood) 6 de julho de 2017

The 'Pilliga Gas Project'

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull shifted the national focus to The Pilliga in the last week of September, when he announced that Australia's gas supply crisis was "three times worse than thought". "We encourage the New South Wales government to approve the development of the Narrabri Gas Project," the PM said. "The sooner that is brought online, the better."

The Narrabri Gas Project is an ambitious plan to drill 850 wells tapping underground natural gas reserves, which resources giant Santos said would be tapped for the domestic market.

But in a sense, the project's name is a misnomer. The "Narrabri Gas Project" brings to mind the town of 7,600 people on the Namoi River, which as the project's administrative base, would likely enjoy a temporary economic upswing. Indeed, Santos already employs 20-30 people at shopfronts in the area.

The Narrabri gas Project should arguably be called The Pilliga Gas Project, because the vast bulk of the 850 wells would be sunk in the Pilliga forest just south of Narrabri -- which consists of a mix of state forest, nature reserve, state conservation area, national park and freehold land.

Whatever you call it, this project -- which is currently in the planning approval phase -- would change the face of the Pilliga. And as the NSW government makes its decision, a fight is bubbling away not just over the forest itself, but over the forest's water resources, which some claim would be degraded.

The Pilliga is a recharge zone for the Great Artesian Basin -- Australia's vast, inland underground water resource without which so much of our agriculture would be unviable. Being a recharge zone means it's one of the few areas which provide significant new water to replenish the basin.

Farmers in areas bordering the Pilliga rely on bore water from the Great Artesian Basin. Their soils are rich but their rainfall is scant. They fear that a project of this scale will destroy the subterranean water pressure and dry up their bores. They also fear groundwater in the forest itself could be tainted.

Santos says there are numerous studies conducted by eminent scientists which have found that coal seam gas can be safely produced without harmful effects on ground or surface water. It cites Ex-CSIRO water expert Dr Richard Creswell, who said farmers' water would "not be impacted by any of the drilling that goes through the Great Artesian Basin to get to the gas".

But RMIT's Dr Matthew Currell -- who has been called up as part of the approval process to help assess the submissions -- told HuffPost Australia that "I think there's genuine concern about the protection of surface water systems and also groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the area".

The Pilliga is situated at the area of shaded blue that dips down into NSW.

The water wars are also being fought over the groundwater in the forest itself. The disputed point is whether the mix of chemicals involved in unconventional gas drilling will leave a toxic mess.

Santos directed HuffPost Australia to the 2014 study by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, which concluded that with appropriate safeguards and controls, natural gas can be safely extracted from coal seams. Richard Creswell said there are "at least three levels of protection" in the gas drilling process.

But RMIT's Matthew Currell said "there's no reason why any land holder that lives in vicinity of coal seam gas wells or waste water storage ponds could not have their water quality affected".

For now, we have a stand-off. Water versus gas. The Pilliga versus what many people see as the pillagers.

With the NSW Department of Planning approval process underway, it's highly unusual that the Prime Minister would overstep the boundaries of his authority, and urge the NSW state government to get cracking with the project.

HuffPost Australia contacted the office of NSW Planning Minister Anthony Roberts to ask whether the PM's urging could potentially help fast-track the approval process. A spokesman for the Minister told us:

"The NSW Government is assessing the Narrabri Gas Project proposal under clear planning legislation and policies. We have also established a panel of four independent scientific experts to advise on the potential water-related impacts. In addition, other government agencies such as the NSW Environment Protection Authority and NSW Crown Lands and Water are also providing advice. We consider all applications under the same rules to carefully assess any potential environmental, social, or economic impacts or benefits. We also closely consider community feedback... There is no set timeframe for determination."

There is much for the Department to assess. As HuffPost Australia reported in June when submissions closed, a record number of 23,000 submissions were received in response to resources giant Santos's proposal. Of these, just 300 were in favour. While many of the submissions opposed to the project are form letters, it's our understanding that at least 5,000 are carefully researched, informed statements of genuine concern.

No person has articulated her concerns with more passion than Anne Kennedy, a farmer from Coonamble, west of the Pilliga, who relies on Great Artesian Basin bore water.

"What you are doing is pitting fuel versus food. Which industry will still be necessary in 20 years? If you want to drink clean water and eat clean food, then this is your problem," Kennedy told HuffPost Australia.

Santos pointed us to a study which showed that "the collective impacts of coal mining and coal seam gas extraction can be effectively managed without negatively impacting agricultural water use across the region".

Pilliga-based ecologist David Paull, who has worked as an environment officer for both state and local governments, is unconvinced.

"I think the fact that there's a record-breaking number of submissions for this project than is a fairly good sign that it's not well received by the community. Certainly in the local region outside Narrabri area itself there's no support for it," he said.

Paull called Environmental Impact Statement for the Narrabri Gas Project "appalling". Santos said the environmental assessment process was "rigorous".

"Santos has the track record and expertise required to safely and sustainably develop the Narrabri Project and deliver reliable, affordable, clean natural gas to NSW for many years to come," a spokesman said.

It's likely that the decision on this project will be made in the first half of 2018. Expect passions to run high whichever way the dice rolls. The Pilliga does not have the emotional tug of some better-known iconic Australian landscapes like the Reef or the Tasmanian wilderness, but to locals, this great, largely uncelebrated Australian forest is everything.

"I'm just an old chook, a broken down farmer," Anne Kennedy said with unconvincing self-deprecation. Then her feisty self returned.

"There will be massive civil disobedience if they approve it. We're not going to give up without a fight."0

Berlinah Wallace, 48, was charged with murdering Mark Van Dongen who was left partially blinded and paralyzed. The Bristol Crown Court jury was dismissed by the honourable Mrs Justice May DBE, who told them the trial was stopping due to legal reasons.

The alleged acid attack happened in September 2015. The matter was due to be the subject of a trial the following year, but the Crown Prosecution Service received confirmation from van Dongen’s father in Belgium that his son had died.

Wallace then pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder between September 22, 2015 and January 3, 2017. The trial was adjourned on November 20 by Judge May to allow a question of law to be further discussed.

News of his departure follows reports he had clashed with lead star Rami Malek, and also failed to show up for filming on more than one occasion. However, in a statement, Byran insisted reports of a feud were not true, and also claimed Fox bosses did not accommodate his requests to take time out to attend to a sick parent. “With fewer than three weeks to shoot remaining, I asked Fox for some time off so I could return to the US to deal with pressing health matters concerning one of my parents,” he said. “This was a very taxing experience, which ultimately took a serious toll on my own health. Unfortunately, the studio was unwilling to accommodate me and terminated my services. This was not my decision and it was beyond my control.”

He continued: “Rumors that my unexpected departure from the film was sparked by a dispute I had with Rami Malek are not true. While, at times, we did have creative differences on set, Rami and I successfully put those differences behind us and continued to work on the film together until just prior to Thanksgiving. “I wanted nothing more than to be able to finish this project and help honor the legacy of Freddie Mercury and Queen, but Fox would not permit me to do so because I needed to temporarily put my health, and the health of my loved ones, first.” The film, which also stars Tom Hollander and former ‘EastEnders’ actor Ben Hardy, is still expected to be released in December 2018 as planned.-1

With a few simple cutbacks, you can enjoy the festivities in full while keeping your liver (and dignity) in tact.

What’s more, according to Dr Patrick Kennedy , consultant hepatologist and gastroenterologist at King Edward VII’s hospital, excessive Christmas drinking can have a major impact on health, “affecting the brain, the heart and our skin”.

With office parties, family gatherings and big nights out, our alcohol consumption can skyrocket over the Christmas period. The result? Starting the New Year poor, with a hangover and a whole lot of post-party fear.

Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical advisor at Drinkaware, says it’s not unusual to feel under pressure to drink more than usual throughout December.

“At Christmas, it seems, none of the usual rules apply. How often have we been told or said to someone else, ‘Oh go on, it’s Christmas’? We all want to fit in, and many people worry that if they don’t accept a drink with their friends or colleagues, they might look as if they’re being stand-offish,” she tells HuffPost UK.

“In addition, we are more likely to gather in groups, whether at someone’s home or at a pub, wine bar or restaurant.

“This brings the risk of everyone taking turns to buy rounds of drinks, which can increase the temptation to drink more. Likewise, at a party at someone’s home, the non-alcoholic drink options may be limited.”

How to cut down your drinking over the Christmas period

If you want to pace yourself over the festive season, discussing your motivations with friends, family and colleagues can help quash any awkward conversations around why you’re not drinking as much.

If you don’t want to go into detail, saying ‘I don’t want the hangover tomorrow’ can suffice.

Dr Jarvis says setting yourself goals and discussing these with loved ones is also key to staying on track.

“Think about how much you want to cut back, how often, and when you will review your progress,” she says.

To cut down your drinking during social gatherings, she recommends taking the following practical steps:

:: Alternate alcoholic drinks with soft drinks.

:: Downsize your drinks - if you’re a beer-drinker, make the units go further by drinking halves instead of pints. If you’re a wine-drinker then opt for a smaller glass.

:: Dinner only drinking - instead of having a drink the moment you’re home, decide to only have an alcoholic drink with dinner.

:: Have an alcohol-free day.

:: Track your drinks with the Drinkaware app.

How to tell when your drinking has gone too far

The Chief Medical Officers’ guidelines recommend men and women should not drink more than 14 units of alcohol per week, spread over several days and with at least two alcohol free days each week.

Dr Jarvis says many people exceed this over the festive period, but you can ask yourself a few questions to determine whether your drinking has gone from festive fun to dangerous territory.

She explains that one of the most reliable questionnaires used to assess whether people have a problem with alcohol asks the following questions, among others:

:: Have you been unable to stop once you start drinking?

:: Have you failed to do what was normally expected from you because of drinking?

:: Have you had a feeling of guilt or remorse after drinking?

:: Have you been unable to remember what happened the night before because you had been drinking?

:: Have you or someone else been injured as the result of your drinking?

Dr Jarvis continues: “If the answer to any of these questions is ‘yes’, and particularly if you’ve answered yes to more than one question, your drinking may well have gone too far.”

What benefits will people feel by cutting down on alcohol?

One of the most obvious benefits of cutting back on alcohol throughout December is that you’ll be able to enjoy each day without a pounding head.

“The short term benefits of cutting back on alcohol include brighter skin, feeling less tired and less irritable and being much more able to concentrate,” Dr Jarvis adds.

“Cutting down has been shown to improve the quality of sleep and for those people who drink to relieve stress, reducing alcohol can also have a positive effect on mental health and wellbeing.

“In the longer term, cutting back on alcohol also lowers the risk of serious diseases like cancer, liver disease, pancreatitis, diabetes and stroke.”0

Sarah Brisdion’s ‘toilet advent calendar’ will see her take a selfie on the loo every day until Christmas Eve to raise awareness of the lack of toilet and changing facilities for disabled people. The mum to seven-year-old twins Hadley, who has cerebral palsy, and Erica, says she believes toilet stigma contributes hugely to lack of awareness around the struggles disabled people face every day when using public toilets. “We don’t talk about toilets and what we do on them. I want to try to break down some of those barriers,” the 37-year-old tells HuffPost UK. “We all have to pee. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. Some people just need a little more help than others.”

Sarah Brisdion

Sarah has created the advent calendar after years of struggles trying to change her son Hadley in disabled toilets without adequate changing facilities, such as benches and hoists. “A lot of the time, the only option we have is using the toilet floor to lie him down, prepare him for the loo and/or change him and get him clothed again,” Sarah explains. “It’s horrendous, undignified, unhygienic and dangerous. I can just about manage to lift him at age seven. I can only imagine how hard it is to lift an adult from a wheelchair to the floor and back up.” The writer and designer details one particularly heart-wrenching situation when the family was food shopping and Hadley had an accident in his nappy. The disabled toilet facilities in the supermarket were so disgusting that she couldn’t bare to lie her son on the floor. “We had no choice but to a take him to the car and change him in the boot,” she reveals. “He was so upset. He was begging us not to change him, but he couldn’t sit in his own waste until we got home, it was everywhere. “We had to do it in the boot. It was freezing cold. We put the heaters on full blast and did everything as quickly as we could, trying to keep him warm and shield him from anybody walking past with their shopping. “He knows we have no choice, but it still really upsets him. He’s very aware of people looking at him and it’s hugely uncomfortable. Seeing my son so distraught is heartbreaking. “When I got home I just sobbed.”

Sarah Brisdion Hadley and Erica, 7.

It’s such difficult times that have spurred Sarah into taking action - she’s been fiercely involved with Changing Places for three years now, which campaigns for fully accessible toilets. It’s thought over a quarter of a million people cannot use standard toilets, yet many disabled toilets aren’t up to the job. Changing Places believes all disabled toilets should have more space and the right equipment, including height adjustable changing benches and hoists. Sarah, who lives in Brockenhurst, New Forest, with her husband Martyn, 38, says Changing Places toilets are fairly easy to install and not too costly, “yet huge multinational businesses are refusing to install them”. Currently there are 1,044 specialist toilets across the UK - but it’s not enough. As Sarah puts it: “There are only around 1,000 toilets in the whole country that Hadley can use. There are millions for everyone else. “That infuriates me, as they are saying my son is not worth catering for. And it’s not just my son, as you know - there are hundreds of thousands of people who need Changing Places toilets.” The lack of services affects the whole family, including Hadley’s twin sister. Sarah says seeing her brother having to be changed in unhygienic places takes a huge toll on Erica, and it also means they can’t go to places where the average family does. “We now have a couple of public Changing Places installed locally,” Sarah explains. “But there is not a single cinema, theatre, restaurant, supermarket, bowling alley or train station that we can go to without having to resort to using a toilet floor or boot of the car. And very few holiday destinations or tourist attractions.”

We’ve all been there. It’s a cold Christmas morning, you’re running late and your now antique car is giving off that unmistakable vibe that this morning, it’s not going to play ball.

The task was a simple one: they needed to realign Voyager’s antenna so that it would still communicate with Earth and in turn they could extend its mission by up to three years.

The problem however was that the thrusters they’ve traditionally been using are starting to show their age and to be quite honest, might not have done the job.

Now because Voyager 1 is currently the only man made object plummeting through interstellar space, the team were somewhat limited in terms of roadside assistance.

Instead they came up with the idea of using another set of thrusters that Voyager used to use in order to help it navigate around the planets in our solar system.

The “trajectory correction manoeuvre” (TCM) thrusters would be able to do the job, but they came with a significant caveat - they hadn’t been used in over three decades.

That didn’t stop the NASA JPL team though.

“The Voyager flight team dug up decades-old data and examined the software that was coded in an outdated assembler language, to make sure we could safely test the thrusters,” said Chris Jones, chief engineer at JPL.1

1. Co-Op and Iceland back bottle deposit schemes

The two supermarkets were the first in the UK to come out in favour of a mandatory bottle deposit return scheme [DRS], after responding to a survey carried out by Greenpeace.

This comes in the wake of the government seeking industry views on implementing such an idea.

“This cannot carry on… deposit return schemes work. In Norway theirs has led to 96% of all bottles being returned, with similar results in other countries that have adopted a DRS. Britain urgently needs to do the same,” Richard Walker, director of sustainability for Iceland, told the Guardian.

To help tackle the biggest social issue facing women and children today, Refuge has launched an advent calendar with a difference .

For most, Christmas means spending quality time with family and friends. But for thousands of women it offers only more of the same: fear of violence and abuse from their partner.

Behind the window on 2 December, Refuge shared the story of Rachael Slack who, along with her 23-month-old son Auden, was stabbed to death in 2010 by her ex partner.

The charity asked people to purchase a pair of Hush Pyjamas, to help women like Rachael escape abuse. Out of every £60 pair sold, £52 goes to the charity. That money is the equivalent of one night’s stay for a women and her child in a refuge.

Behind window four, Refuge described the work it does supporting victims of modern slavery, some of whom have been forced into prostitution and raped up to 10 times a day.

The charity called on people to help fundraise money to continue providing vital services, helping these people escape and find support.

Overall, the charity estimates it will support 6,000 women and children this Christmas, providing not just a place of warmth and safety, but the opportunity to enjoy the festive season.

Sandra Horley, the charity’s CEO, said: “This Christmas, 340 women and children will be waking up in one of our shelters. Across Refuge’s services we will support almost 6,000 people.

“But for every woman and child safe with us, there are hundreds more in urgent need of support. No matter how many women and children we support; there are hundreds more who need Refuge.

“We rely on public support for so much of the good we do. Christmas is a time of giving, and I hope that #RefugeAdvent will raise awareness of the enormous challenges facing women this Christmas. I hope the public will play its part in supporting our work; knowing that by working with Refuge they can help us to save lives.”1

Lansman, who is all but certain to be elected to the ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) in the New Year, put on Facebook his support for the radical proposal.

Under the plan, drafted in a Change.org petition by the Ealing branch of the grassroots organisation Momentum, the London Labour party board would have to start its selections afresh.

The move follows a bitter bout of in-fighting in the party over “de-selections” of moderate councillors in Haringey who had backed a controversial public-private housing development programme.

But as the left-wing and moderate elements of the party battle it out for the key seats ahead of the 2018 local elections, Momentum now claims that Blairite group Progress and Labour First activists are blocking their own candidates.

The Ealing Momentum petition states: “We believe that the 2018 local government candidate selections have been conducted in a manner that has resulted in potential candidates being excluded from selection on spurious grounds and has disenfranchised newer party members in a way that is unjustified and avoidable.”

It insists that any potential candidates excluded from shortlisting or selection must be re-interviewed and reassessed for suitability for selection.0

Species such as dotterel, whimbrel, common scoter and Slavonian grebe are all said to be in danger, based on projections around the impact of global warming. The findings come from a new report compiled by the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), along with various statutory nature conservation bodies. Experts fear that the Scottish crossbill, which is found only in Scotland, is at risk of becoming extinct altogether.

PA Archive/PA Images The Scottish crossbill, which is found only in Scotland, could become extinct

By contrast, however, some other birds were found to have thrived in the warmer, wetter climate, which has enabled them to expand their range further north. The study found climate change is already affecting bird life in the four countries of the UK, which is responding to a 1C (1.8F) increase in average summer temperatures since the 1980s. “Birds in the UK are showing changes in abundance and distribution, predominantly moving northwards, in a way that is consistent with a changing climate,” the report said. “Migratory birds are arriving earlier and egg-laying dates have advanced such that swallows, for example, are arriving in the UK 15 days earlier, and breeding 11 days earlier, than they did in the 1960s.” For species such as the dotterel, whimbrel, common scoter and snow bunting – whose UK breeding populations are found almost entirely in Scotland – population declines are said to have been considerable already. Breeding success of the Slavonian grebe has also been impacted, with Scotland on average 11% wetter between 2007-2016 than it was in 1961-1990

PA Archive/PA Images The UK’s kittiwake population has declined by 70% since 1986

The report went on: “The UK’s kittiwake population has declined by 70% since 1986 because of falling breeding success and adult survival. “Climate change has reduced the availability of the sandeels they rely upon in the breeding season. “Other species that feed largely on sandeels, such as Arctic skua, Arctic tern and puffin, are at high risk of climate-related decline.” On a more positive note, the report also found that warmer temperatures during the breeding season have had a positive effect on breeding success for a range of species. Birds that feed insects to their young, such as great tits and chaffinches, have improved their productivity in warm, dry springs, while nuthatch, goldfinch and chiffchaff have been expanding their range into Scotland over the last 30 years with large increases in numbers north of the border. Dr David Douglas, principal conservation scientist at RSPB Scotland, said: “The recent research compiled in this year’s The State of the UK’s Birds report shows that many birds in Scotland are being affected by a changing climate. “For some birds this means they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to UK extinction, including many species where most, if not all, of the breeding population is found in Scotland. “Other birds appear to have thrived in this warmer, wetter climate, which has allowed them to expand their range further north.”

But will she have to repeat that explanation to Parliament? The long-held convention is for a Prime Minister to update the House with a statement on any significant EU talks (David Cameron once had to answer an Urgent Question to tell MPs about an informal EU council), but I understand No.10 has decided no such statement will occur today.

Commons sources told me that Government whips had told the Opposition last week to clear “several hours” today for a “major” statement. Speaker Bercow helpfully confirmed it had been “very much my expectation” the PM would make an EU statement on Tuesday. Instead of spending hours trumpeting a diplomatic triumph, May faces a gruelling session being asked repeatedly about the DUP. May said alongside Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday that she needed further “consultation” and Labour argues there’s no better vehicle for consultation that the House of Commons. I’d be surprised if there is no attempt to force her hand with an Urgent Question. And if she ducks a statement, maybe David Davis will be put on the rack instead.

I wrote last night HERE on how the Brexit deal victory yesterday slipped through May’s fingers. It appears the DUP were spooked by early leaked over-sells of the agreement, but more worryingly Arlene Foster’s party were not fully signed up to the exact wording. Was Damian Green too distracted by his own woes to carry out one of his key duties as First Secretary of State, reassuring the DUP? Was the absence of Gavin Williamson (the Chief whip who sorted the DUP confidence and supply deal) a factor? May is due to meet the Northern Ireland party today and No.10 is remarkably upbeat about chances of progress.

Tom Newton-Dunn points out there were last minute quibbles over the European Court of Justice. Yet the key to yesterday’s difficulties was that deliciously diplomatic phrase ‘continued regulatory alignment’ between Ulster and the Republic after Brexit. It seemed like a classic EU fudge to get both Dublin and Belfast on board and move onto ‘Phase 2’ of talks (on trade and transition). Some in London felt it was a key concession from Dublin, as alignment is not the same as convergence, no matter what Irish PM Leo Varadkar says.

What’s the way out of the fresh impasse? Well, as Robert Peston has pointed out, one answer is reassuring the DUP that ‘alignment’ is UK-wide and not just for Ulster. That however poses a problem for Cabinet Brexiteers like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who have long wanted the freedom of ‘regulatory divergence’. Another option is to explicitly say the alignment is only on Good Friday Agreement legal precedent on specific areas such as animal welfare, agriculture and a single energy market. Another is to beef up the ‘no hard border’ written guarantees.

But one other option is for a newly ingenious diplomatic phrase. As the head of Northern Ireland’s Institute of Directors put it this morning, ‘regulatory co-operation’ may be acceptable to both Dublin and Belfast. So too may ‘regulatory equivalence’. Those alternatives imply similar trade arrangements to now, but turn them into parallel lines rather than convergent ones. The phrase may be enough to get May through to Christmas with her Government intact. After a weeks of leadership plots and Cabinet resignations, that would be a triumph in itself. But the bigger battle over trade and transition starts in the New Year and the DUP has given the PM just a taste of the trouble ahead if she doesn’t mind her language.0

http://cnn.com/2017/12/05/health/cigarette-smoking-pot-smoking-study/index.htmlSmokers are 7 times more likely to use marijuana daily, study says(CNN) Smoking cigarettes and daily use of cannabis are strongly linked in the United States, research says. Smokers, overall, are seven times more likely to use pot daily than non-smokers, according to a study recently published in the American Journal of Public Health.

This relationship was found to be especially strong among young people between the ages of 12 and 17. Nearly a third of traditional cigarette smokers in this age group said they also used cannabis day in and day out, the researchers say. In fact, young smokers were more than 50 times more likely to use cannabis daily than their nonsmoking peers.

Comparing the overall number of daily cannabis users in 2002 and 2014, the researchers saw another trend.

"More people are smoking cannabis on a daily basis," said Renee Goodwin, the lead investigator and an adjunct associate professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. She said all the groups examined -- smokers, former smokers and nonsmokers in the US -- showed increasing rates of daily cannabis use.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse , marijuana is the most commonly used "illicit" drug, used by about 22.2 million Americans. (The institute classifies marijuana as an illicit drug despite legislation in a few states that permits recreational use of this drug.)More men than women use the drug, a gender gap that widened even further between 2007 and 2014.

Impact of cigarettes

Goodwin and her colleagues collected data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 2002 through 2014, a total of 725,010 people. Respondents, who were offered $30 to participate, answered personal interview questions plus some computer-assisted, self-interview questions designed for privacy and confidentiality.

Participants reported how often they smoked cigarettes, if at all, and how long it had been since their last cannabis use.

Generally, smoking and daily pot use were found to go hand-in-hand.

"Daily cigarette smokers were over seven times more likely to use cannabis daily, and non-daily cigarette smokers were over four times more likely to use cannabis daily than were never-smokers," Goodwin said.

This relationship was strongest for people between the ages of 12 and 17. In 2014, 28% of daily smokers and 13% of non-daily smokers between those ages used cannabis daily, suggesting that about 40% of 12- to 17-year-olds who smoke cigarettes used cannabis daily in 2014.

Some groups showed a stronger association than others. For instance, the link between smoking cigarettes and daily cannabis use was stronger among Hispanic smokers than white smokers and among females compared with males.

Hispanic smokers were more than 10 times more likely to use cannabis daily than nonsmoking Hispanics, while white smokers were more than seven times more likely to use cannabis daily than their nonsmoking peers.

Like Hispanics, female smokers of all groups were found to be more than 10 times more likely to dip into cannabis every day than nonsmoking females. Yet male smokers were more than six times more likely to use marijuana daily than nonsmokers, Goodwin said.

Though previous surveys have shown declining rates of drug use among teens, Goodwin and her colleagues found an increase in daily use of marijuana in every group.

Increasing use

"The rate of increase was faster among non-daily cigarette smokers vs. daily smokers, and we were surprised to find that the fastest rate of increase of all was among former cigarette smokers," Goodwin said. Looking at the different age groups, she and her colleagues found that "the increase was fastest among those ages 26 and older."

Daily cannabis use also increased among non-daily smokers (3% in 2002 compared with 8% in 2014) and daily smokers (5% in 2002 versus 9% in 2014) and even among former smokers (0.98% in 2002 versus 2.80% in 2014).

Another researcher in the field, Regina A. Shih, a senior policy researcher at RAND Corp. who conducts research on substance use in early adolescence, said the study provides "new information" to health providers.

Shih, who was not involved in the new research, focuses on the underlying factors that explain differences in substance use by race and ethnicity in her own work.

"The fact that this study found a linkage between cigarette smoking and daily marijuana use that was stronger among Hispanic and other non-white respondents compared to white respondents has implications for the US given the changing demographic makeup of the country," she said.

"It was particularly concerning to see that the highest prevalence of daily marijuana use was among the 12- to 17-year-olds who smoked cigarettes," Shih said. It's well-known, she said, that regular marijuana use in teens can have negative consequences for brain health and educational attainment.

Parents might also be troubled by the new research, she said.

Advice to parents

"The study addresses the misconception that families and the public health community don't have to worry as much about non-cigarette smokers," Shih said, noting the overall increase in daily cannabis use, with a faster rate of increase among people who formerly or never smoked cigarettes. The study also suggests the possibility that reductions in daily cigarette smoking are being replaced with an increase in rates of daily marijuana use, she said.

One drawback of the study "is the inability to draw conclusions about what is happening with individual and family, peer or neighborhood factors that can drive the choice among cigarette smokers to use cannabis on a daily basis," she said.

Research will need to examine the reasons adolescents -- particularly younger ones -- to use cannabis daily in addition to or instead of cigarettes.

"With the changing landscape of recreational legalization by states, it will be important to continue to monitor time trends in daily marijuana use by medical versus recreational use and modes of use," Shih said.

Richard Miech , a research professor at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, agreed that trends in marijuana use are of particular interest today "because of the growing wave of states that are legalizing marijuana for recreational use."

Miech, who was not involved in the new study, said there's some concern that legalization could increase marijuana use among underage people. "Legalization has the potential to increase marijuana use in all states," he said, "because many will interpret legalization as a signal that marijuana use is safe and state-sanctioned."

The study also suggests a new twist on the "gateway" theory that using cigarettes puts people at risk of using marijuana, Miech said: "It is possible that, moving forward, some people may start first using marijuana and then transition to cigarette smoking."

This "reverse gateway" effect hasn't been seen much, he said, and vaping might also lead to additional "transitions between cigarettes and marijuana use."

Goodwin said the issue is "complicated," especially for parents.

"There may be a lot of confusing messages today among youth today about whether and to what degree cannabis use is harmful, especially in comparison with cigarettes," she said. "In many places, youth are clear that cigarettes are harmful, but with marijuana especially amidst rapid legalization, this is not clear.

"What we are talking about here is daily cannabis use, and that is generally agreed upon to have a number of potential risks," including physical, neurological and mental, Goodwin said.

"Cigarette smoking -- which is sometimes easier to detect -- is a strong indicator of increased likelihood of cannabis use," she said. Talking to kids about the potential risks of both cigarettes and cannabis is "critically important at an early age."0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/04/health/north-korea-defector-doctor-intl/index.htmlNorth Korean soldier: Surgeon says defector 'was like a broken jar'This story contains an image of a parasitic worm. Viewer discretion is advised

Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korean surgeon Lee Cook-Jong was already having a busy day in Trauma Bay 1 when he got the call: A US Black Hawk helicopter was on its way with an injured soldier. But it wasn't just any soldier.

"I was informed that he was badly shot by North Koreans," Lee said, reliving the complex chain of events that brought North Korean defector Oh Chong Song to his trauma unit on November 13.

Lee says he went to meet his critically injured patient on the helipad, just a few hundred feet from the state-of-the-art, US-modeled trauma center he runs at Ajou University Hospital in the South Korean capital, Seoul.

The chopper was coming in fast, and for that, he says, he was thankful.

"His vital signs were so unstable, he was dying of low blood pressure, he was dying of shock," Lee said.

"He was like a broken jar. We couldn't put enough blood into him."

Video provided by the Ajou University Trauma Center shows Oh being loaded off a helicopter.

Riddled with bullets, he was dragged to safety by South Korean soldiers and hovered close to death during the 25-minute airlift to hospital.

What unfolded after the Black Hawk touched down was a harrowing effort to keep Oh alive that lasted more than six hours -- captured in video Lee shared exclusively with CNN, with the permission of the soldier.

Video provided by the Ajou University Trauma Center shows Oh being wheeled into a trauma room.

Minute by minute struggle

In the first 30 minutes, after Oh was rushed into Trauma Room One, Lee and his team worked to keep Oh breathing.

"He has one (bullet) through his right knee joint; the other one is the tricep muscle area on his arm, the third one was his back; chest and coming out from his shoulder," Lee said as he reviewed the video.

But the worst was yet to come.

During a five-hour operation to remove a bullet that had pierced Oh's intestines, Lee encountered a complication he's never seen in his 20-year career as a surgeon: parasites.

Lee describes working to repair at least seven wounds in the defector's perforated bowel while the white worms were squirming their way out of Oh's body.

"Everything was stained with blood, but the parasite was basically a really white color and this thick, big, long and very, very hard, this kind of thing was getting out from his bowel system," Lee said.

The worms Lee removed from Oh's body.

Lee describes Oh's vital signs as so unstable that a few times during the grueling operation, he thought the defector would die on the surgical table.

"It's a miracle that he survived," Lee said.

All parasites were removed from Oh's system, some of them as long as 27 centimeters (more than 10 inches).

Intestinal worms are typically transmitted through contact with feces or unwashed hands. The use of human fertilizer on crops and poor sanitary conditions can also aid the transmission of parasitic cysts.

Lee appears to have grown fond of Oh during the weeks he's been treating him.

"I'm very proud of him. He fled from North Korea seeking for liberty, much more freedom. It's quite easy to say, but it's really, really difficult to make it happen, so I admire him," Lee said.

Lee operated on Oh again two days later for more than three hours, and within days of that, the defector began a fast-paced recovery that has surprised even his doctors.

Walking, talking

Oh is walking, talking and going to the bathroom independently. His condition, though stable, is still grave.

Complications from tuberculosis and hepatitis B continue to compromise his recovery, especially his liver function.

Oh is also under psychiatric care and likely to be struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder, Lee said.

He's been plagued by nightmares, sometimes fearing he was still in North Korea, prompting Lee to hang the South Korean flag in his recovery room to remind him he was safe.

"He actually asked me, 'is it really South Korea?' And I said, 'have a look at that flag. Have you ever seen that flag in North Korea?'"

It's unclear what the future holds. Oh has told his surgeon that he's interested in studying law. Lee says he has no interest in going into the South Korean military, as other defectors have done.

For now, though, his condition is still so delicate that Lee says he told South Korean officials "very firmly" that they had to postpone questioning Oh. As a border guard on active duty, he's likely to have valuable information on North Korea's armed forces.

The South Korean government screens defectors for security risks and runs resettlement programs to help them adapt and integrate into South Korean society -- something that can be an uphill struggle.

Lee is protective of his patient, and Oh remains under heavy security in the hospital so that nothing can compromise his treatment.

"If there's so many questions about his past years in North Korea. It might affect his emotional status, so if he's in depressed status, he may not be able to eat properly or recover properly," Lee said.

To take his mind off the pain, Lee encouraged Oh to listen to music -- he likes K-Pop group Girls Generation -- and watch television. Lee says the first movie he saw was "Transporter 3," an action movie starring Jason Statham.

Oh told Lee that American and South Korean TV dramas are popular in North Korea, suggesting that some people have access to outside media.

"I was quite surprised," Lee said.

Newfound celebrity

Throughout Oh's miraculous survival and recovery, Lee, a renowned surgeon who trained in San Diego, says it's been hard to not let the stress get to him.

There's been intense interest in Oh's story across South Korea and by international media, and as one of the few people who has access to him, the demands for information are relentless.

He said that while Oh's survival is a miracle, it is an outcome his team strives for every day with every patient.

The tradeoff is much personal sacrifice.

Lee says he goes home just one day a week, spending the rest working and sleeping in the trauma center he has nurtured for years.

What he's not used to is his newfound celebrity. As we walk outside with him, he's asked to pose for a photograph within a matter of minutes.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/04/health/cocaine-opioids-fatal-overdoses-study/index.htmlCocaine death rate for blacks on par with opioids for whites(CNN) The American opioid crisis is only part of an overall drug abuse emergency. Cocaine-related overdose deaths among non-Hispanic blacks are on par with overdose deaths caused by heroin and prescription opioids among whites, according to a study published Monday in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

"Numerous US national surveillance studies and media reports have highlighted an alarming rise in drug poisoning deaths in recent years," said Meredith Shiels, a co-author of the study and an investigator at the National Cancer Institute. However, most of the studies focus on opioid-related deaths, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl. They also tend to emphasize the fact that death rates are "rising most rapidly among white Americans," she said.

The researchers, from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Cancer Institute, found that cocaine overdoses also killed Hispanics and whites over the time period studied.

But the new study reveals the increasing rates of drug overdose deaths among black and Hispanic Americans.

"These increases have received less attention," Shiels said.

Overdose deaths rise 5.5% each year

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 16,849 Americans died due to an overdose in 1999, and in 2015, the number of overdose fatalities reached 52,404. Overall, rates of overdose deaths increased by 5.5% per year between 1999 and 2015. Most of that increase has been attributed to opioid-related deaths among white persons.

To understand drug trends in fatal overdoses, the researchers looked at data from 2000 through 2015. National statistics on drug overdose deaths are based on information from death certificates.

Increases in overdose deaths were seen across all age groups of whites and Hispanics, yet rising rates were most pronounced among older black men (50 or older) and older black women (45 or older).

Cocaine was the largest contributor to overdose deaths among black men and women. Cocaine-related deaths peaked between 2004 and 2007, declined between 2008 and 2011, and then increased again between 2012 and 2015 among blacks, whites and Hispanics. But, the largest recent increase in overdose deaths for black and Hispanic people was due to heroin.

However, Shiels said, there were also increases due to natural or semisynthetic opioids (such as morphine and oxycodone), benzodiazepines (such as Valium and Xanax), synthetic opioids (such as fentanyl) and psychostimulants (such as methamphetamine) among blacks and Hispanics.

"There were too few drug overdose deaths among Asian-Americans to be able to draw meaningful conclusions about mortality rates by drug type, so this group was omitted," Shiels said.

The researchers also compared data from 2000 through 2003 with data from 2012 through 2015. Among blacks, total overdose death rates increased from 6.1 per 100,000 people for the earlier period to 9 per 100,000 people for the later period; among Hispanics from 4.2 per 100,000 to 6 per 100,000; and among whites from 5.6 per 100,000 to 15.5 per 100,000.

"In the most recent years studied, 2012 to 2015, cocaine overdose deaths were almost as common in black men as prescription opioid deaths in white men and slightly more common in black women than deaths from heroin overdose in white women," Shiels said.

The percentage of overdose deaths not attributed to a specific drug (as recorded on death certificates) between 2000 and 2003 and 2012 and 2015 varied across groups: 14% and 16%, respectively, for black people; 14% and 16%, respectively, for Hispanic people, and 25% and 21%, respectively, for white people.

Overall, about 20% of death certificates reporting an unintentional overdose are missing information about the drug that caused the death, the researchers said.

'Widely available' drugs

"Drug poisoning deaths can be classified as unintentional, suicide, homicide or undetermined intent," Shiels explained. "As unintentional poisonings make up the vast majority of poisoning deaths (about 80%), it is likely that some of the deaths classified as 'undetermined intent' are also unintentional overdoses."

These blurry lines mean the total number of fatal overdoses may be underestimated across the United States, she said.

Though correctly estimating cause of death may be a challenge, it is less difficult to explain the increase in fatal overdoses.

"The rise in prescription opioid overdoses is clearly related to the rise in availability of prescription opioids in recent years," said David Thomas, a co-author of the study and a health scientist at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

"Compounding the problem, heroin is widely available and much less expensive on the black market than diverted prescription opioids, thus many prescription opioid abusers are switching to heroin because of price and availability," he said.

Adding to these problems, fentanyl and carfentanyl are also being sold on the streets as heroin. These two drugs "are hundreds or thousands of times more powerful than heroin," Thomas said.

The reason behind the increase in cocaine use is not as clear. Still, the rising rate of overdoses caused by that drug "does underscore that we not only have an opioid crisis but a more general drug abuse crisis," Thomas said.

This opinion is shared by Brandon DL Marshall, an associate professor in the department of Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health.

'Alarming' increase in fatal overdoses

Marshall, who was not involved in the new research, said it draws attention to the fact that the drug crisis is affecting all communities, "regardless of racial/ethnic background."

"While overdose death rates are highest among non-Hispanic whites, the increase among African-Americans and Hispanics is alarming and deserves greater public health attention," he said.

What's new in the study is how the different races had different peak ages for overdose deaths, Marshall noted. The highest rates for whites were in the 30-to-34 group, while the highest rates for blacks are among the 50-to-59 group.

"More research is needed to uncover the underlying reasons for this difference by age and race," he said.

Marshall also noted that, due to a lack of information about specific drugs causing an overdose on death certificates, the study was not able to clarify whether the uptick of overdose deaths in recent years is due entirely to opioids or other drugs.

One unrelated recent study looked at the underreported drug information on US death certificates and found that in 2008, 25.4% of the total 36,450 fatal overdoses did not identify a specific drug, compared with 19.5% of the 47,055 overdoses in 2014, he said. Some states provided specific drug data for 99% of all fatal overdoses, but other states did so only 50% of the time.

"States with centralized systems in which medical examiners are responsible for investigating overdoses have higher rates of reporting toxicological results on death certificates than de-centralized, county systems in which coroners investigate deaths," Marshall said, based on his knowledge of a separate 2013 study

"The difference may be due to the fact that coroners are typically non-physicians who have less familiarity with toxicological analyses and terminology," he said.-1

Boy was one of twins; the second twin, a girl, was stillborn

New Delhi (CNN) An Indian hospital has fired two doctors fired for mistakenly declaring a newborn baby boy dead.

The baby was born at the Max Super Speciality Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi, last Thursday but pronounced dead two hours later, the boy's grandfather, Praveen Malik, told CNN.

His mother had given birth to twins but the girl was declared stillborn.

The parents were on their way to a cremation ground when they noticed "some movements" inside one of the polythene bags that the hospital gave them with the babies' bodies.

"When we opened the bag, we found the boy breathing. I was shocked. I couldn't believe my eyes," Malik said.

http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/12/us/beneath-the-skin/#ep1Beneath the SkinIn fear for his life, a Chicago police officer shoots an armed black teen. At least, that’s one version of the story. What really happened the day Roshad McIntosh died?

Horrific cuts cover her son’s body after he’s shot and killed by police, and Cynthia Lane wants answers. She asks CNN to investigate.

Horrific cuts cover her son's body after he's shot dead by Chicago police, and Cynthia Lane wants answers. A yearlong investigation by CNN's Rosa Flores shows the truth is not always black and white.

How CNN reported this story

Chicago mom Cynthia Lane called CNN in 2016 and asked reporter Rosa Flores to look into her son’s death. That one phone call led to a yearlong investigation and the making of “Beneath The Skin.”

Flores and a team of producers consulted with forensic pathologists in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Missouri regarding some disturbing photos of Roshad McIntosh’s body. Flores and team obtained autopsy reports, autopsy photographs and investigative documents from the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County. The spokeswoman for the Office of the Medical Examiner of Cook County did not grant CNN an on-camera interview, but agreed to respond to questions by email and later by phone.

CNN filed public records requests for the police report; the investigative report prepared by the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA); the IPRA interview transcripts and corresponding audio files of one witnessing officer and the shooting officer; the fingerprint analysis on the gun and the tracing documents on the gun; audio from the 911 calls; the surveillance video of the scene; and videos and photographs taken by investigators on the scene. After reviewing the materials themselves, Flores and the team asked two law enforcement experts to review the materials independently of each other.

During Flores’ investigation, CNN interviewed two men who say they witnessed the shooting first hand. They did not want to show their faces on camera for fear of police retaliation and asked us to change the register of their voices. Lane confirmed she talked to one of the men the day of the shooting.

For information regarding Roshad McIntosh’s arrest record and possible gang affiliations, we consulted with the Cook County Clerk of Circuit Court, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, and the Law Office of the Public Defender of Cook County. Chicago Police confirmed to Flores that McIntosh had been arrested three times and had no known gang affiliations.

IPRA, now called the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and the Cook County State Attorney’s office sent CNN written statements in response to questions regarding our findings and did not want to comment further.

In 2015, Cynthia Lane filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Chicago and some of the officers involved. Flores reached out to the City of Chicago Mayor’s Office requesting an interview with Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the request was denied, citing the pending litigation.

She also asked the Chicago Police Department for an interview with Superintendent Eddie Johnson and the request was denied, citing the pending litigation.

Flores reached out to the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7, which is the union that represents Chicago police officers, asking for comment and interviews with the shooting officer and the witnessing officers. The request was denied, citing the pending litigation. Instead, the group directed CNN to their blog, “The Watch” for the group’s take on lawsuits against the police and media coverage of them. Flores also attempted to call the officers involved directly through publicly listed phone numbers, but they could not be reached for comment.

After IPRA re-opened its investigation into the McIntosh case in August 2017, local media picked up the story. An article published in the Chicago Tribune on November 29 included details from depositions taken in 2015 and 2016 for the civil lawsuit Lane filed against the City of Chicago. CNN put in a public records request to access the depositions of all the officers involved, and obtained transcripts of eight depositions on November 30.

Most of the reporting for this project was done in Chicago and Miami, with additional production support from New York, Atlanta and Chicago. Flores filmed herself at her desk and in the field over the course of the investigation to support the project’s production.0

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/05/technology/future/home-of-future-materials/index.htmlThe quest to make homes that repair themselvesHome ownership can be a drag. It's expensive and maintenance is time consuming.

But what if you had a home that repaired itself?

There'd be no need to replace driveway cracks, touch up exterior paint, or patch a hole in your wall.

It may sound too good to be true, but work is underway to build homes from living materials to reduce upkeep, without harming them.

DARPA, the arm of the U.S. Department of Defense that researches new technologies, launched a project last year to create new types of materials that have the structural abilities of traditional building materials but the attributes of living systems. DARPA has a track record of helping invent the future -- it laid the foundation for the Internet and self-driving vehicles.

The organization points to the advantages of biological materials such as coral, bark and even skin. They can be grown in many places, repair themselves and respond to their environment. The best steel or concrete in a skyscraper can't compete with those abilities.

"Consider the things in your house that decay and rot — your walls, your siding," said Justin Gallivan, who manages the DARPA program. "Are there ways you could reimagine maintaining them by keeping them alive so that they could repair themselves?"

Related: The future of getting dressed: AI, VR and smart fabrics

DARPA is working with one company, Ecovative, to make physical molds for structures. The idea is that soldiers could easily carry the molds, and then unfold them wherever they need to build housing.

By using living materials such as mushroom roots, houses would grow naturally to the shape of the mold. In addition, soldiers wouldn't be put in harm's way as they carried bulky housing materials in dangerous areas.

Eventually, Gallivan envisions reprogramming biology so that seeds could grow on their own into a given shape, such as a 2 x 4 piece of lumber.

It's still the early days for these technologies, and it's unclear when the average person would get to enjoy these benefits. The wait could last for decades.

But some innovators -- such as Sidewalk Labs, the urban innovation lab of Google's parent company, Alphabet -- are working toward this goal.

Sidewalk Labs recently announced a plan to develop a Toronto neighborhood designed as model for city life in the 21st century.

In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs will also be using mushroom roots, but as insulation in its buildings. The roots, formally called mycelium, have already been used in some cases as a packaging material.

Related: In the future, your kitchen will think for itself

Sidewalk Labs is also embracing other natural materials. It plans to build mid or high-rise buildings with wood, rather than the usual steel or concrete. The approach should save money, speed constructions and be better for the environment.

The organization will also be using a Japanese lime plaster made from seaweed extracts, soybean oil, natural plant fibers and other natural materials.

In parts of Asia, there's nothing novel about building with living materials. In some cases, tree roots are guided across rivers — a process that can take 15 years — to create a living bridge that carries foot traffic. These bridges can be found in Japan's Iya Valley and in Meghalaya, a state in Northeast India.

So don't be surprised if one day if your entire home grows and heals itself.

"We believe it's possible to accelerate urban innovation by creating a new type of place where cutting edge technology and people first design are built into the very foundation," said Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff earlier this year.1
http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/12/04/port-washington-alleged-animal-cruelty-arrest/Nassau County SPCA: Port Washington Man Arrested For Biting Dog’s Eye OutPORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — A Long Island man has been arrested for allegedly biting out his dog’s eye, the Nassau County SPCA said Monday.

It’s a case Gary Rogers from the SPCA has never heard of before, WCBS 880’s Sophia Hall reported.

“I don’t like to say I’ve seen it all, because I just haven’t,” he said. “Every time I think that, we just see something new that we shake our heads at.”

The SPCA said the investigation began back on Nov. 9 when the dog, a 3-year-old shih tzu named Chloe, was brought to an animal hospital with “a serious eye injury.”

A veterinarian later determined that Chloe’s right eye was bitten out, according to the SPCA.

“The eye was popped out of the dog’s socket, according to the veterinarian,” said Rogers.

Following an investigation, the SPCA says 20-year-old Aaron Kluger was arrested Sunday in Port Washington where he lives with his parents.

“We don’t know why and how he did it,” Rogers said. “He said he was playing with the dog and it may have happened, but other people were able to tell us that he was the one who bit the dog’s eye out.”

The dog’s eye was able to be reattached and Rogers is hopeful she will be able to see again in that eye in the future.

“As long as it gets care and gets rest and doesn’t have any other trauma, they’re hopeful that the eye will stay in and that it will have most of its vision back,” he said.

Kluger is due in court later this month.-1

Hundreds of volunteers helped search for her, and on Saturday, some of them gathered to say goodbye.

A little over 50 people joined together at Christ Community Church for a memorial service. Most of them never met Sherin but felt a deep connection.

“It just touched me that this happened right on the doorstep of our church, almost,” said lead pastor Dr. Terrence Autry.

Dr. Autry’s church opened its arms as dozens showed up to honor the 3-year-old.

Sherin was found dead in a culvert near her home after she went missing in October. Her adoptive parents face criminal charges in connection to her case.

Wesley Mathews has been charged with felony injury to a child and her mother, Sini, was arrested and charged with child endangerment.

On Saturday, some of those who tirelessly searched for Sherin got up to speak at the memorial, saying they were touched by her story. They hope she can feel the love they have for her.

“We just felt as a church, let’s just give people an opportunity to come and share and grieve and maybe even unify a little bit so we can better protect our community,” said Dr. Autry.

While the vigil was a chance for a community to heal, court hearings continue for the Mathews next week.

A child specialist said in court this week that Sherin had broken bones and injuries in various stages of healing.

Sherin’s memory lives on in picutres and in the hearts and minds of a community in mourning.-2

http://cnn.com/2017/12/05/politics/steve-bannon-alabama-roy-moore/index.htmlBannon returns to Alabama to campaign for Roy MooreWashington (CNN) Former White House adviser Steve Bannon returns to Alabama to campaign for Roy Moore on Tuesday -- and this time, President Donald Trump is on his side.

Moore's campaign said that during their phone conversation, Trump called the Senate hopeful a "fighter," and wrapped up the call by saying, "go get 'em, Roy!"

"Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama," Trump tweeted. "We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!"

Bannon, on a radio program hosted by Breitbart, where he is the top executive, later said: "Liberal Puppet Jones, that's a good handle, it's almost as good as Little Bobby Corker or Crooked Hillary, et cetera."

Campaigning for Moore on Tuesday night, Bannon plans to bring "fire and fury," a source familiar with his plans said.

He plans to go hard after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who until recently had looked for ways to get Moore out of the race because of the sexual allegations. And he'll say that the "deplorables" -- of whom he considers himself a leader -- are responsible for Trump endorsing Moore and the Republican National Committee reversing its earlier decision to cut Moore off and going back into Alabama this week.

He'll say that Jones is both a radical progressive and someone the McConnell-led Senate GOP would rather see elected than a member of their own party.

It took Bannon at least four months -- and he was dismissed as White House chief strategist in August -- to get Trump on his side.

In the White House, he advocated for the President to back Moore over Sen. Luther Strange in the Republican primary for Attorney General Jeff Sessions' former seat.

But Trump ultimately sided with McConnell in supporting the incumbent Strange.

Still, Bannon urged major conservative donors to back Moore. He met with him in Washington. He made headlines with a campaign event in a barn in Fairhope, Alabama -- southeast of Mobile, an area packed with the moderate, pro-business Republicans who Moore has to win over -- on the eve of Moore's September runoff election against Strange.

And when McConnell dumped Moore and Trump went days without commenting on the allegations during his Asia trip, Bannon continued his support.

He'll return to the same site Tuesday night for what could be a rally aimed as much at McConnell -- as a symbol of the Washington establishment -- as Jones. As of Monday afternoon, 2,000 people had indicated on Facebook they were interested in attending the rally.

It comes three days before Trump holds an event in nearby Pensacola, Florida -- 25 miles east of the Alabama border.

That Trump would even go near Alabama is a victory for both Moore and Bannon.

McConnell's super PAC pumped millions into the effort to help Strange. And when the sexual allegations were first reported by The Washington Post, McConnell called them credible and urged Moore to withdraw from the race

McConnell's political aides drafted a memo laying out potential scenarios in which Moore could be replaced. His allies polled Alabama voters to see if Strange or even Sessions could beat Moore as a write-in candidate.

None of it worked: Moore stayed in the race. And McConnell appeared to admit defeat Sunday on ABC's "This Week."

"I think we're going to let the people of Alabama decide a week from Tuesday who they want to send to the Senate, and then we'll address the matter appropriately," McConnell said.

"Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity," Romney tweeted.0

Washington (CNN) Former GOP House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Tuesday that Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore doesn't deserve to win the special election in Alabama.

"I think he deserves to lose," Cantor told CNN's "New Day." "And when I was in office as majority leader, I had the policy of zero tolerance for any of this kind of stuff."

Moore has been accused of pursuing sexual relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. In some cases, the women who have come forward about the relationships have alleged sexual abuse or assault. Moore has denied all the allegations.

Cantor added that voters "expect their leaders to live to a much higher standard, and that's what ought to be maintained."

President Donald Trump officially endorsed Moore on Monday, and the Republican National Committee has agreed to fund Moore's campaign after withdrawing support last month.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/05/africa/macadamia-nuts-south-africa-china/index.htmlChina fuels Macademia nut boom in South Africa(CNN) The lush Limpopo Valley region of South Africa is known as a haven of exotic wildlife and fruit trees.

But the traditional crops of guava and avocado are making way for more popular produce: macadamia nuts.

South Africa has swiftly become one of the world's leading producers of the nut. Production rose from 3,000 tons in 1996 to over 40,000 tons in 2015, and almost 4,000 hectares of new trees are added each year.

The vast majority of the nuts are exported, and increasingly it is China that is fueling the boom, buying up 40% of the total haul according to China's National Industry Association (CSNC ).

Demand for macadamias has been particularly strong in the special administrative region of Hong Kong.

"In the last seven years that we purchased macadamia nuts we have had growth of around 25% every year," Ben Chan, purchasing supervisor at Hong Kong-based retailer HK JEBN, told CNN.

Macadamia nuts are in high demand.

Such growth is welcome for South African farmers, but there are also concerns. Chinese buyers typically favor their nuts in shells, which are less profitable than in their processed form. Further, demand for imports could fall in the long-term.

"There are some big challenges in China, one is they are planting a lot of macadamias themselves," says Jill Whyte, co-founder of one of South Africa's largest manufacturers Green Farms.

"I think there is some over-reliance on the China market," says Barry Christie, operations manager of the Southern African Macadamia Growers' Association (SAMAC). "I believe as an industry we should expand and make sure that we don't become over-reliant."

The solution may be further innovation to create new growth opportunities. Green Farms is targeting the lucrative ingredients market and supplies Haagen-Dazs and Nestle among other clients.

"We believe (ingredients) are a huge area for growth in the industry," says Jill Whyte. "80% of almonds are sold into the ingredients industry and only 20% as a snack, and macadamias are the opposite so there is a huge opportunity."

South Africa's macadamia boom looks set to continue for a while yet.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/04/opinions/stopping-female-genital-mutilation-opinion-lemmon/index.htmlHow to fight female genital mutilation with economicsGayle Tzemach Lemmon is a CNN contributor and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations . She is the author of "Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield." The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) Seleiman Bishagazi never enjoyed the benefits of a university education, but he's smarter on a basic human rights issue than nearly anyone I've met in the world.

This activist showed me what ground-level investigation, hard-core determination and a lot of community conversation taught him about the practice of female genital mutilation : Follow the money.

Female genital mutilation is not an issue I ever thought about in economic terms. In pieces I wrote over the years about this practice of using (often unsterile) knives to remove in part or in total a girl's external genitalia, people would talk with me about it as a cultural practice -- one that girls and women in communities had begun to stand up to, but one that activists fighting the practice said only changed generationally.

'Girls as capital'

"When I saw girls and the way they were going through this pain, I thought, 'This must stop,' " Bishagazi, chairman of Kipunguni Knowledge Center, a community group in Dar es Salaam, told me. "It made me become a champion of stopping this practice."

But stop it how?

According to Bishagazi, families would get monetary gifts when their daughters underwent the procedure.

"I used to attend ceremonies, and I saw how people were benefiting from this," he says.

"I knew right away they were using FGM as a source of income because people would say, 'I will build a house after my daughter goes through this.' They were using girls as capital."

Girls as capital. Female genital mutilation as an economic transaction as much as a cultural tradition. It all became clear as Bishagazi recounted his journey to get to the source of the practice. It's a journey that offers tremendous insight into how to end practices that threaten the well-being of girls and women across the globe.

Dollars drive the practice

Once Bishagazi figured out that one big part of the incentive behind female genital mutilation was economic, he decided to ask more about how and why. The answers quickly became clear.

Parents would talk with him about how they bought land on the gift money they received after cutting ceremonies. Older women who wielded the knives talked about the money they would make during the cutting season, which arrived every two years, in years divisible by two. Even brothers would benefit from the presents that came in as their sisters faced the knife in the name of tradition.

Poverty -- at least as much as culture, in Bishagazi's community -- stood behind the continuation of female genital mutilation, he came to realize. And so earning money would have to be at the center of stopping cutting.

The prospect of jail clearly was not enough. The practice of female genital mutilation is outlawed in Tanzania but continues despite the threat of imprisonment, especially among the nation's poorest. According to the UNICEF , in 2016, among Tanzania's most impoverished citizens, a quarter of girls and women ages 15 to 49 have undergone the procedure. That number drops to 6% among the wealthiest Tanzanians.

Those in the Kipunguni program discuss how to stop the practice.

So Bishagazi, as a community leader determined to change the status quo, decided to attack the issue with economics and education. Neither on its own, he felt certain, would actually make a difference. It would take the two of them together. He turned to a women's rights nongovernmental organization called the Tanzania Gender Networking Program, or TGNP , for help.

"We had a big event at TGNP and what he did was to bring people from Kipunguni to attend that event so that they could learn the negative side of FGM," says Lilian Liundi, executive director of TGNP. "He asked for a bus to go and pick members of Kipunguni community to come and attend the event. ... The event was quite successful and that is where they learned a lot about FGM and the impact of FGM."

Says Liundi, "This thing they do, it is because they get money. So he knew that if they have alternative ways of getting money, then that will help them to leave practicing FGM."

Creating a financial alternative

Bishagazi began to attack the problem from the ground up. Literally.

He says he knew that women who were cutting girls received about 30,000 Tanzanian shilling (roughly $14) for one girl. So he tried to figure out how to replace that income.

"Agriculture was not a hard thing to do, it didn't need a lot of capital, and a lot of women were doing it in other places," Bishagazi says. It also provided a steadier source of income than female genital mutilation, which is only conducted for a short period every two years.

So Bishagazi suggested they start, together, growing things on a plot of land he had access to, beginning with vegetables. He didn't have money from any local charities, but he did get fertilizer and seeds from a local church that supported his efforts.

Women in the Kipunguni program stand in their community garden.

After two growing cycles, and once the vegetables began turning a profit, he started talking with the women performing female genital mutilation about the problems that came with the practice -- that it is considered violence against women under the law and could land them in prison.

Bishagazi's fellow program members agree that the convincing began once the money started coming in.

"When you do agriculture, you can earn" roughly $10 a day, says Fatima Brahman, a Kipunguni community leader. "And you can do it throughout the year. And it is clean and legal money."

That argument convinced parents and women who previously supported cutting to join the effort. Thus far, Bishagazi says, the community program has close to 150 members.

Bishagazi and Brahman are not alone in turning to new sources of income in an effort to disrupt the tradition. Tanzanian charities designed to stop female genital mutilation have offered women startup capital to get them to end these practices and focus on small business. Bishagazi says at least two women have now stopped cutting and become part of his community program. A third is strongly considering it.

Slowly and step by step, with introductions and educational materials from TGNP, Bishagazi has built a community group focused on farming, women's leadership and safety. A youth garden for children to come and plant in after school is also part of the program. The adults are focused on growing vegetables, earning incomes and spreading the word that female genital mutilation risks women's lives and the community's health. The teens tend to the chickens and the vegetables -- and, soon, the fish pond -- and tell the older people if they hear of parents who are seeking to perform the procedure on their daughters.

The work is not easy

"Since I joined the program last year, I am waiting to see if next year the girls I have talked to will have to undergo the procedure," says Victoria Johnson, a 20-year-old involved in the Kipunguni program. Next year will be pivotal for the program to see if its efforts to educate and offer alternative incomes will make a difference. "It is very hard for them to understand because they are raised like that, to think it is a good thing."

Johnson faced the threat of cutting when she turned 18. She refused to undergo the process. She says angry relatives called her rejection of the practice "shameful" and told her father he was raising his children "against our culture." Johnson is among a lucky few: Her father sided with her and said that she didn't have to go through with the cutting if she didn't wish.

Gayle Tzemach Lemmon speaks with Seleiman Bishagazi about his work.

Many are not so lucky.

"I joined this program because I was not happy about undergoing cutting," Upendo Jackson says. "I refused to go through with it, but I had no choice." She puts her head in her hands for a moment as she talks to me about the pain she endured during female genital mutilation. "My mother was there and she thought it was the right thing because she went through it, and she was also very happy because afterward she got gifts from all the women."

Jackson stayed in bed sick for weeks after undergoing the procedure.

"It was so painful," she says. "I lost a lot of blood."

She vowed her younger sister would not face what she did. She says she took her to the police station and told the authorities to protect her sister. And she became committed to stopping the practice so that other girls would not have to face the hell she endured.

Jackson says she agrees with Bishagazi that dollars drive the practice.

"Many people doing FGM are doing it because they're poor," Jackson says. She cites her own story -- and notes that her mother bought land with the money she got from her cutting. "We think we could end it if people could get some capital."

Other young women in the program say that ending the practice is about standing up for themselves.

Empowering women through economics

"It is not the women who decide; it is the elders who say we have to continue this practice," says Justina Gasaya, a 20-something woman who is part of Bishagazi's program. "So when women are empowered, especially economically, it gives them power. And changes the balance of power in the community."

And getting more capital and more resources -- more power -- to women in his community is indeed Bishagazi's aim. He wants to grow the community's agriculture business, starting with planting vegetables and raising chickens and fish on a bigger plot of land his group received from the government.

He also is seeking to secure the funds -- about $9,000 -- to buy a cold storage facility that would help Jackson, Johnson and others in the group to process the food they grow and to sell at markets farther from home. The team is talking to supermarkets in Dar es Salaam about buying their organic products from them directly.

In Bishagazi's vision, these community farms would spread nationwide -- every place that female genital mutilation is proving hard to stop -- so that those who cut girls and families who turn to the practice for financial sustenance could find another way to survive.

"We have realized when women don't have economic power it is very easy to conduct gender-based violence," Bishagazi says. "My dream is to end FGM once and for all."

For everyone who cares about building stronger, safer and more stable communities that grow more prosperous because they reap the talents of all their members -- boys and girls -- Bishagazi's dream matters a great deal. And it's one in which we all have a stake.-1

No group has claimed responsibility for attack

(CNN) The number of dead in the devastating twin bombing in the Somali capital of Mogadishu in October has jumped to 512, authorities announced Sunday.

Nearly 70 people remain missing, and 295 still have injuries suffered in the attack, Abdullahi Mohamed Shirwac, the chairman of the 11-member government investigation committee, said in a press conference.

The October 14 attack was already the deadliest in Somalia's modern history. Government officials reported the death toll at 358 near the end of October. Two Americans were killed in the blast, the US State Department said.

It was not immediately clear what caused the death toll to increase so significantly more than a month and a half after the deadly attack. There still has been no claim of responsibility.

(CNN) Jimmy Kimmel is off his show this week, but it's for a good reason.

The late-night host has taken time off to care for his son, who underwent a second heart surgery Monday.

"ABC's 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' welcomes guest hosts this week," the network said in a statement on Monday. "Jimmy's son, Billy, had a scheduled and successful heart surgery this morning."

Some "celebrity Samaritans" have stepped up to fill in for Kimmel including Chris Pratt, Tracee Ellis Ross, Neil Patrick Harris and Melissa McCarthy.

Kimmel revealed in May during an emotional monologue on his late night show that his son William John Kimmel was born on April 21 with a serious heart issue. The newborn had open-heart surgery a few days after he was born.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/04/media/fox-news-msnbc-correction-error/index.htmlFox News tweets correction on MSNBC report after Twitter users call out errorFox News corrected a demonstrably false report the network aired on Sunday about MSNBC's coverage of the Kate Steinle verdict after social media users pointed out the error to Fox News and nearly 12 hours after CNN first alerted the network's PR department.

During a "Fox & Friends Weekend" segment, host Pete Hegseth told viewers that MSNBC had "completely ignored" news that a jury on Thursday acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who was in the U.S. illegally, of murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Steinle. Zarate was convicted of being a felon in the possession of a firearm, which could bring a three-year sentence.

"MSNBC did not cover the verdict once on Friday or on Saturday," Hegseth claimed.

But that's not true, and on Monday at 5:20 p.m., nearly a full business day after this reporter sent the first of multiple alerts to Fox News about the error, a correction was posted on the network's "Fox & Friends" Twitter account.

"On Sunday we said MSNBC did not cover the Steinle verdict on Friday or Saturday at all," the tweet said. "We were wrong. In that 48 hour span, they covered it a total of 2 minutes and 15 seconds."

Fox News' delay in correcting a false story is a curious one. Not only did the story relay incorrect information to its large audience, but the network has harped on its competitors for mistakes by giving such errors a significant amount of attention on-air and online.

Fox News also issued a correction in the online version of Hegseth's story and deleted the tweets that promoted the article on Twitter. One tweet posted early Monday morning on the Fox News Twitter account was retweeted more than 7,500 times before the network deleted it in the evening. It's not clear whether there will be a correction made on-air. A Fox spokesperson did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Hegseth's false claim about MSNBC was reported by Fox News online under the headline "'0 Minutes': MSNBC Ignores Kate Steinle Trial Verdict."

"While most networks offered mixed coverage to the trial of an illegal immigrant accused of killing Kate Steinle, one network ignored the case's verdict altogether, Pete Hegseth reported," an original writeup of the Hegseth segment on Fox News Insider read. "Hegseth said MSNBC did not cover the verdict of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate at all."

MSNBC covered the Steinle verdict on Friday, as well as on Thursday's episode of "Hardball" soon after the news first broke.

During a Friday morning segment on "First Look," MSNBC reported on the verdict and President Trump's reaction to it. Additionally, the network aired video from the San Francisco Chronicle showing reaction from Steinle's parents.

Host Stephanie Ruhle teased another segment on the verdict during the 9 a.m. hour, but breaking news about Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI seemingly preempted it.

A spokesperson for MSNBC declined to comment.0

Ed Miliband has declared he’s “not a Centrist Dad” and praised Jeremy Corbyn for mobilising young voters and proving his doubters wrong. In an interview for HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, the former Labour leader joked that the label – applied to middle-aged fathers who patronise Corbyn followers – could not be applied to himself. Dad-of-two Miliband, who now hosts his own weekly ‘Reasons To Be Cheerful’ podcast, also revealed: he turned down an invitation to appear on the Great British Bake-Off

a Cabinet minister had told him his tweet attacking the Government’s Brexit “piss up in a brewery” chaos was “very restrained”

his office had rejected a request to appear in a Walkers’ Crisps advert with Gary Lineker

he saw Brexit as a ‘mandate’ for a Labour government to radically change Britain.

Miliband said that the dramatic upswing in young voters in the June general election had been sparked by their ‘shock’ at the Brexit referendum and by Corbyn’s fresh appeal. “One of the reasons for that was the way Jeremy mobilised young people. I think that is a massive positive,” he said. “I am not a ‘centrist Dad’. I think the sense of the desire for change among young people, the sense of ‘we want big things to be different’, whether it’s on tuition fees or climate change or inequality is incredibly positive. “Jeremy’s galvanizing young people in politics is a remarkable success, it is a reason to be cheerful. There were people who were more or less sceptical about Jeremy, but I think he proved his doubters wrong in 2017 in the election.” The former Labour leader, who has nearly three quarters of a million followers on Twitter, went viral again this week after he ridiculed the Tory government’s attempts to get a deal on Brexit.

What an absolutely ludicrous, incompetent, absurd, make it up as you go along, couldn’t run a piss up in a brewery bunch of jokers there are running the government at the most critical time in a generation for the country. — Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) December 5, 2017

He explained that the tweet, which garnered 114,000 likes, was sent in exasperation after he listened to a minister try to defend the DUP. “We voted late on Brexit on Monday night and I woke up the next morning listening to the radio and I was hearing some minister say something that made it sound like the DUP were running the country. “And I just thought ‘oh for goodness sake’. The whole fiasco of ‘manic Monday’, really and truly! “A member of the Cabinet just said to me, I won’t name him, ‘very restrained Tweet’.” Miliband said he was enjoying the freedom of being a backbencher and the licence it gave him to use social media in a way no party leader could. “It’s true I couldn’t have done that tweet [as Labour leader]. “I did a tweet the other week saying Donald Trump is an absolute moron. OK, lots of people liked the tweet. There was a context, it was because he was spreading false stuff about the crime figures in the context of radical Islamic terrorism.

Spreading lies about your own country: sad. Spreading lies about others: sadder. What an absolute moron. https://t.co/0EACPcX9xR — Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) October 20, 2017

“Jeremy Corbyn no doubt agreed with me, but even he can’t tweet that Trump is an absolute moron – and that’s Jeremy Corbyn, who no doubt feels less constrained than I felt. “I don’t think tweets from me or Jeremy Corbyn or Donald Trump replace what journalism does, but it definitely gives you an audience. “That’s the upside, there are lots of downsides to Twitter. I always say to people who are new on Twitter: don’t read what people write about you on Twitter. That’s the first principle….it can be toxic.” But Miliband said that he didn’t want to use his online popularity to follow former colleague Ed Balls down the reality TV show route of either ‘Celebrity Great British Bake-Off’ or ‘Strictly Come Dancing’.

PA Archive/PA Images Ed Balls on Strictly

“I confess I turned down Celebrity Bake Off… I’m just not very good,” he said. “No to the [I’m a Celebrity] Jungle. I tend to lay off the celebrity doo-dah, sort of thingummies. “I did get asked to do this crisp advert with Gary Lineker. Lynsey who works for me said no to that. I didn’t even get to find out what that would have involved me doing. “Celebrity mastermind? No….I think it’s a direct route to humiliation actually.” Miliband said his hugely successful ‘Reasons to Be Cheerful’ podcast, hosted with radio presenter Geoff Lloyd, was one way he was trying to help Labour. “What role can I play? I want to be person who helps provide the ideas that a Labour government can implement. “That’s partly what the podcast is about. If a Tory government wants to implement that’s good as well. I’m quite struck in the listener feedback we get, it’s not just Labour people listening.”

During Wednesday (6 December) night’s show, Dennis told Iain he had a “problem” with him doing the latest trial, as he had said “Get me out of here!” during two previous ones. “What I don’t want to do is we have no dinner and so….” Dennis said. “OK, but I also got 11 stars on one,” Iain interrupted. Dennis then said: “I get that but you’ve also said ‘get me out of here’ twice; out of the three you’ve done you failed…” Correcting him, Iain went on: “No, I failed one of them, the other was a challenge.”

Dennis then concluded: “If you come back with nothing everyone will be upset.” Iain then offered to withdraw from the trial, but said if he was not allowed to do any others during his remaining time in the jungle, it would be “unfair”.

Dennis then hit back, saying: “Well Iain, the problem is you’ve gone a couple of times and you’ve come back with nothing, so that causes me a slight issue.” The row was the latest in a long line of incidents between the pair, and left viewers feeling it was time for ITV to step in and take action:

For those who missed the show, Lord Sugar tasked the candidates with organising a fashion show and contestants Michaela and Elizabeth were given the job of booking male models for the occasion. Both women were grossly inappropriate from the moment the men entered the room, giggling and joking about the task being “all business and no pleasure at all”.

Michaela demanded to check to see if one of the models had a six pack, which could be justified during a casting for an industry that is, after all, based on aesthetics. But it was the way she did it, mock flirting and biting on the end of her pen, that made it clear this was not a professional request.

To add insult to injury, Elizabeth made a joke about slipping with the tape measure while measuring a model’s inside leg, touching his crotch in the process.

Caring in Bristol needs help running its annual Caring at Christmas project, which helps provide homeless people with warm and safe beds, food and social activities. Meanwhile Cats Protection is in need of volunteers to feed and play with shelter moggies over the festive break and beyond.

The charity desperately needs volunteers to help pack parcels at foodbanks across the country. And it’s not the only one looking for support.

This Christmas, the largest foodbank provider in the country is expecting its “busiest Christmas ever” . The Trussell Trust said there was a 47% increase in three-day emergency food supplies last December compared to the monthly average and the same is expected this year, but on an even bigger scale.

Step aside materialism. Christmas is the season of giving - and what better way to give than by volunteering?

What it does: It’s a national charity for single homeless people. It is dedicated to ending homelessness by delivering life-changing services and campaigning for change.

What it does: It’s a worldwide Christian church and registered charity dedicated to caring for people who are vulnerable or in need. It works with some of the most disadvantaged people in communities including homeless people, older people and victims of modern slavery.

Opportunities this Christmas: The charity runs local Christmas present appeals, where members of the public donate gifts and food for children and families who might otherwise go without. Toy parcels and food hampers are then packed and distributed to those in need.

Many Salvation Army centres in the UK will be running local Christmas present appeals. To find out if your nearest one is participating, find them on the charity’s website or contact them directly for more details.

If your local Salvation Army isn’t running a Christmas present appeal or you aren’t able to get a gift to them, you can donate to its Christmas fundraising appeal.

Opportunities this Christmas: The charity is recruiting 1,000 Bristol-based volunteers to help them run their annual Caring at Christmas project, which helps provide homeless people with warm and safe beds, food and social activities during the Christmas period.

The shelter opens on Christmas Eve at 3pm and remains open until 10am on 1 January 2018, aiming to welcome over 200 guests each day, provide 60 beds each night and serve 5,000 hot meals. As homelessness is so prominent in Bristol at the moment, the charity is expecting an especially busy Christmas.

The Caring at Christmas project will run at the Night Shelter, Little Bishop Street, Bristol BS2 9JF.

What it does: It’s the UK’s leading feline welfare charity, helping around 200,000 cats and kittens every year.

Opportunities this Christmas: Cats Protection relies on the efforts of volunteers throughout the year but it particularly needs a helping hand (or paw) over Christmas.

Cat care volunteers provide cats and kittens with hands-on care and attention and play an important role in keeping the cats happy and healthy until they are ready to be rehomed. They still need feeding and looking after over the Christmas period when many of the staff are on leave, so volunteers get the chance to make a real difference.

The role involves: cleaning the cats’ living environment, grooming, feeding and spending time playing with the cats. No particular skills or experience are required apart from a love of cats. Training is provided so the charity recommends signing up as early as possible if you are looking to work over the festive period.

With 34 adoption centres across the UK, there are many opportunities to get involved. Find out more here.

What it does: It supports older people all over the country to stay independent at home and active in their communities.

Opportunities this Christmas: The charity’s volunteering opportunities tend to be longer term, however if people sign up now they might be able to become a volunteer by Christmas.

Volunteering could mean driving someone to a Christmas event or helping them to get food in for the Christmas period. They could also sign up to be a trolley volunteer – providing refreshments and company on ward to patients having a stay in hospital over Christmas (and beyond).

Sign up to become a volunteer here. If you can’t spare your time, the Royal Voluntary Service also accepts donations to support their work.

What it does: It supports vulnerable families from low income backgrounds within Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Opportunities this Christmas: The charity is desperately seeking volunteers to help wrap gifts for its toy appeal and support its ‘People’s Pantry’ - a foodbank initiative.

No training is required for wrapping toys, but the charity offers safeguarding training and a food safety qualification for those getting involved with ‘People’s Pantry’.

To sign up, email info@alicecharity.co.uk.

What it does: It’s a new charity which helps homeless people move off the streets and into sustainable homes.

Opportunities this Christmas: The charity is looking for people to support with its ‘furniture mine’ initiative, delivering furniture to families who are living without beds and sofas.

No training is required to volunteer, you’ll just need an on-the-job induction.

To sign up, email johnwebbe@emmauspotteries.org. uk.

What it does: It combines surplus food, spare kitchen space and volunteers to create nutritious, community meals for people who are hungry and lonely.

FoodCycle runs 33 community-powered projects across the UK, operating in cities in the North of England, East Anglia, Birmingham, London and the South West.

Opportunities this Christmas: The Christmas period can be especially difficult for FoodCycle guests and it’s also a challenging time for volunteers to keep their projects running.

Each week, volunteers collect food from supermarkets and local retailers, take it to a venue (such as a community centre) and cook a healthy, vegetarian, three-course meal for the community.

The charity would love to welcome new volunteers who hate food waste but love other people. You can sign up here: volunteer.foodcycle.org.uk.

What it does: It’s an animal welfare organisation in London helping thousands of dogs and cats to escape a life of abandonment, cruelty and neglect each year.

Opportunities this Christmas: Mayhew is seeking reliable and dedicated people who are able to offer space to homeless cats in their home on a temporary basis until Mayhew finds a suitable permanent home.

The volunteers have to be responsible for the safe transportation of the animal to and from Mayhew, attend vet appointments, keep the foster cat permanently indoors, contribute to the care and welfare of the animal on foster, and to be available for a potential adopter to view the cat at the foster home.

For more information about the volunteer role, click here.

What it does: It provides support to RAF families.

Opportunities this Christmas: There are many ways you can help. Royal Air Forces Association volunteers make thousands of calls and visits to those in need. They also get involved with fundraising initiatives and raise the money needed to provide vital welfare support services.

Some of the volunteering roles include:

:: Caseworkers, which carry out home visits to assess the needs of beneficiaries and develop a support package.

:: Befrienders, who reach out to those who ask for help to offer friendship and support.

:: Fundraising team leaders, who create and organise local fundraising activities.

:: Fundraisers, who help fundraise at events alongside serving RAF personnel.

You will be given appropriate training to ensure you have the support and skills you need, whether you’re delivering welfare support or fundraising.

The motif has been completely changed, marking the first time a different template has been used since the show’s move from Channel 4 in 2011.

Channel 5

The new eye is more realistic than ones of previous years, and is based on a real human eye this time around. Given Big Brother’s decline in ratings in recent years, this huge overhaul could indicate other big changes for ‘CBB’ when it returns to our screens in January. We already know it will launch with an all-female line-up (how very ‘BB8’), but we’ve looked deep into the new eye to see what else it suggests to expect from the new series... A back-to-basics approach

Channel 4 The original 'Big Brother' eye

Not since the very first series has the ‘Big Brother’ eye been based on a human one, and its return to this format could point to the show’s return to its roots - meaning none of the theme-heavy aspects and ridiculous twists and turns that have dominated the Channel 5 years. A real social experiment

Channel 4

As part of a back-to-basics approach, we could also see the show become a true social experiment once again. Since inheriting ‘Big Brother’ in 2011, Channel 5 has made no secret of the fact they viewed it as an entertainment format, rather than the surveillance show it began as. But after Endemol boss Peter Salmon admitted it had to change in order to survive, it looks likely they could look to the past for influence. Introducing a line-up of all-female housemates to see how they interact is certainly a good starting point, but we wonder whether it will also herald the return of the physiologists, who featured in first few years on Channel 4. A broader mix of housemates Interestingly, the logo does not feature the traditional star that usually sets apart the celebrity series from the main one. This could indicate we won’t just be seeing the usual mix of reality stars and singers from yesteryear, with housemates coming from a more diverse background. A press release bosses sent out ahead of the eye’s release also hinted at this with the inclusion of anyone from “politicians to performing artists”. A slicker and more simplistic house

Channel 5 Will houses like this be a thing of 'BB' past?

The theme and colour of the ‘BB’ eye usually give us a good indicator of what the interior of the house will look like. Last year’s January house was as much of a headache as the logo. If we work off the same basis, the new series should see the Borehamwood bungalow boasting a futuristic and minimal look, with sleek, clean lines - a big departure from the sets of more recent years. The females will be the boss While we know the series will initially see an all-female house to celebrate 100 years of women’s suffrage, male celebrities will still enter as the series goes on. However, the logo strongly hints it will be the women who hold the power in the house, but how will this affect the dynamic of the group?0

Ed Miliband has declared he’s “not a Centrist Dad” and praised Jeremy Corbyn for mobilising young voters and proving his doubters wrong. In an interview for HuffPost UK’s Commons People podcast, the former Labour leader joked that the label – applied to middle-aged fathers who patronise Corbyn followers – could not be applied to himself. Dad-of-two Miliband, who now hosts his own weekly ‘Reasons To Be Cheerful’ podcast, also revealed: he turned down an invitation to appear on the Great British Bake-Off

a Cabinet minister had told him his tweet attacking the Government’s Brexit “piss up in a brewery” chaos was “very restrained”

his office had rejected a request to appear in a Walkers’ Crisps advert with Gary Lineker

he saw Brexit as a ‘mandate’ for a Labour government to radically change Britain.

Miliband said that the dramatic upswing in young voters in the June general election had been sparked by their ‘shock’ at the Brexit referendum and by Corbyn’s fresh appeal. “One of the reasons for that was the way Jeremy mobilised young people. I think that is a massive positive,” he said. “I am not a ‘centrist Dad’. I think the sense of the desire for change among young people, the sense of ‘we want big things to be different’, whether it’s on tuition fees or climate change or inequality is incredibly positive. “Jeremy’s galvanizing young people in politics is a remarkable success, it is a reason to be cheerful. There were people who were more or less sceptical about Jeremy, but I think he proved his doubters wrong in 2017 in the election.” The former Labour leader, who has nearly three quarters of a million followers on Twitter, went viral again this week after he ridiculed the Tory government’s attempts to get a deal on Brexit.

What an absolutely ludicrous, incompetent, absurd, make it up as you go along, couldn’t run a piss up in a brewery bunch of jokers there are running the government at the most critical time in a generation for the country. — Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) December 5, 2017

He explained that the tweet, which garnered 114,000 likes, was sent in exasperation after he listened to a minister try to defend the DUP. “We voted late on Brexit on Monday night and I woke up the next morning listening to the radio and I was hearing some minister say something that made it sound like the DUP were running the country. “And I just thought ‘oh for goodness sake’. The whole fiasco of ‘manic Monday’, really and truly! “A member of the Cabinet just said to me, I won’t name him, ‘very restrained Tweet’.” Miliband said he was enjoying the freedom of being a backbencher and the licence it gave him to use social media in a way no party leader could. “It’s true I couldn’t have done that tweet [as Labour leader]. “I did a tweet the other week saying Donald Trump is an absolute moron. OK, lots of people liked the tweet. There was a context, it was because he was spreading false stuff about the crime figures in the context of radical Islamic terrorism.

Spreading lies about your own country: sad. Spreading lies about others: sadder. What an absolute moron. https://t.co/0EACPcX9xR — Ed Miliband (@Ed_Miliband) October 20, 2017

“Jeremy Corbyn no doubt agreed with me, but even he can’t tweet that Trump is an absolute moron – and that’s Jeremy Corbyn, who no doubt feels less constrained than I felt. “I don’t think tweets from me or Jeremy Corbyn or Donald Trump replace what journalism does, but it definitely gives you an audience. “That’s the upside, there are lots of downsides to Twitter. I always say to people who are new on Twitter: don’t read what people write about you on Twitter. That’s the first principle….it can be toxic.” But Miliband said that he didn’t want to use his online popularity to follow former colleague Ed Balls down the reality TV show route of either ‘Celebrity Great British Bake-Off’ or ‘Strictly Come Dancing’.

“I confess I turned down Celebrity Bake Off… I’m just not very good,” he said. “No to the [I’m a Celebrity] Jungle. I tend to lay off the celebrity doo-dah, sort of thingummies. “I did get asked to do this crisp advert with Gary Lineker. Lynsey who works for me said no to that. I didn’t even get to find out what that would have involved me doing. “Celebrity mastermind? No….I think it’s a direct route to humiliation actually.” Miliband said his hugely successful ‘Reasons to Be Cheerful’ podcast, hosted with radio presenter Geoff Lloyd, was one way he was trying to help Labour. “What role can I play? I want to be person who helps provide the ideas that a Labour government can implement. “That’s partly what the podcast is about. If a Tory government wants to implement that’s good as well. I’m quite struck in the listener feedback we get, it’s not just Labour people listening.”

The hugely influential organisation, which has powered Jeremy Corbyn’s transformation of the Labour party, faces claims that it exceeded spending limits and failed to declare accurate or complete returns on donations and payments.

The Electoral Commission said that it was possible that during its probe it would identify other potential contraventions or offences under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission’s Director of Political Finance and Regulation and Legal Counsel, said the investigation would discover whether the rules or law were broken before deciding appropriate action.

“Momentum are a high profile active campaigning body. Questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at June’s general election risks causing harm to voters’ confidence in elections,” he said.

“There is significant public interest in us investigating Momentum to establish the facts in this matter and whether there have been any offences.

“Once complete, the Commission will decide whether any breaches have occurred and, if so, what further action may be appropriate, in line with its enforcement policy.”-1

He said: “If the party was led by a more moderate social democrat, of even middling ability, they would now be 20 points ahead in the polls and on the cusp of power.

“Instead the Labour movement is consumed by an internal battle for its soul.”

But Theresa May has reportedly cancelled her trip to the event as she focuses instead on rescuing her ‘Brexit breakthrough’ plan.

Exactly a week away from the next EU summit, May’s most pressing problem is on getting agreement on the Northern Ireland border issue. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said she’d told him yesterday “she wants to come back to us with some text tonight or tomorrow”, though he added that “we can of course pick it up in the New Year”. And although the DUP’s Nigel Dodds described the delay suggestion as “a dangerous game”, his own party is briefing it can wait too. A DUP source has a rather blood-curdling line in the Sun: “We’re going to slow it all down. This is a battle of who blinks first — and we’ve cut off our eyelids.”

Although May is looking forwards not back, the blame game within Government is well underway as to how on earth this week’s planned breakthrough could have collapsed. Several Tory MPs yesterday told me of their unhappiness with new Chief Whip Julian Smith, with one minister saying he failed to properly keep the DUP in the loop when tasked to brief them on Sunday. Some in the DUP also blame Damian Green, who is meant to coordinate with devolved governments, for the communications breakdown, but it’s Smith that’s in many sights now.

And even if May can come up with a form of words that gets the DUP back on board to move Brussels talks onto ‘Phase 2’, that next phase could be much more tortuous for the PM. Philip Hammond let slip that the Cabinet hadn’t even discussed, let alone agreed, on the ‘end state’ for Brexit. Yes, 18 months on from the EU referendum, our Government has not yet decided what kind of Brexit it wants.

The most notable feature of PMQs yesterday was the way May stressed the details of the Irish border issue could all be sorted in Phase 2 as part of wider UK-EU trade talks. That’s because the Cabinet hasn’t signed off such phrases as ‘regulatory alignment’. And Brexiteers think the DUP have done everyone a huge favour by focusing minds on what kind of trade we really want. Boris pushed back on ‘alignment’ in Cabinet on Tuesday, but Michael Gove kept his counsel, leaving others to suspect he was keeping his powder dry for the battle ahead over what the ‘end state’ will look like.

Chris Grayling insisted on Today that ministers “have had detailed discussions discussing the European Union issue”. Yet No10 told us yesterday the first ‘end state’ Cabinet discussion would take place by the end of the year. Brussels sounds even more intransigent on trade and transition than it does on the Irish border, divorce bill or citizens’ rights. With Hammond pushing in the ‘Norway’ direction on trade, Brexiteers pushing in the ‘Canada-plus’ direction and Brussels, May’s own future hangs in the balance as she tries to find a workable compromise. If she can’t sort the end-state, early 2018 may be the beginning of the end of her premiership.0

According to New Jersey State Police, Shanaya Coley, of Paterson, was last seen shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday outside of her Colonial Avenue apartment complex.

A witness who called police reported hearing a struggle and a woman screaming, NJ.com reported. The witness then reportedly saw someone armed with a knife push Coley into her car and drive off.

At the time of her alleged abduction, Coley, the mother of a 3-year-old boy, was heading to her nursing job at Eastern Christian Children’s Retreat in Wyckoff, police said.

Coley’s father, William, 62, was unavailable for comment Thursday. In a Wednesday interview with WNBC, he said police told him they found blood and his daughter’s glasses in the parking lot of her apartment complex.

“Right now, I’m just sitting here wondering where is my child, hoping she’s all right,” Coley’s father told PIX11. “She has a son to come home to.”

Coley’s vehicle, a silver 2013 Nissan Altima with New Jersey registration plate R74HRX, is still missing, police said.

It’s unclear if authorities suspect Coley was targeted. Her father told NBC New York that she’d recently taken out a restraining order against someone. That person’s identity is not yet known.

Rachel Martin, Coley’s mother, is pleading for information in the case.

“Help me find my baby,” she told News 12 New Jersey. “That’s all I got. That’s my life.”

Authorities have not released a description of Coley or the clothing she was last seen wearing.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Sergeant Marco Aliano of the Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office at 862-849-6019 or the Paterson Police Department Major Crimes Division at 973-321-1120.-1

“We want the world to know that the women are telling the truth,” one of the protesters, Ginger Poynter, told local news outlet News 5 WKRG. She was referring to the multiple women who have accused Moore of groping, harassing and pursuing them decades ago when they were teenagers.

Moore, 70, has denied all of the allegations, calling them “malicious” and “false.” On Monday, President Donald Trump endorsed him in the Dec. 12 special election.

The red robes and white bonnets worn by the oppressed women in the 1985 Margaret Atwood novel ― now a Hulu TV series ― have become an increasingly common sight this year at various political events as the GOP has rolled back protections on reproductive rights and health care coverage.

At the protest outside a Moore rally in Fairhope, Alabama, many of the “handmaids” wore black tape across their mouths with the names of his accusers. Some of the protesters, including those in plain clothes, held signs with slogans such as “We want a senator not a predator” and “Pray to end child molestation.”

On Tuesday, the social media platform revealed the world’s 10 most retweeted and three most “liked” posts of 2017. Trump, who regularly shows off in front of his 44.1 million followers by launching unprovoked attacks on his opponents, failed to feature on either list.

To add insult to injury, Trump’s predecessor in the White House, former President Barack Obama scored high in both roundups. Three of Obama’s tweets made the “most retweeted” list and two appeared in the “most liked” category.

Obama’s plea for racial equality following white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August was both the “most liked” tweet of the year, and the second most retweeted.

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." pic.twitter.com/InZ58zkoAm — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 13, 2017

Obama’s Twitter followers more than double the number for Trump ― as of Monday, the ex-president had 97.6 million.

Some slight consolation for Trump may be that he was crowned the most tweeted about elected world leader this year. But as various stories have noted, he’s often mentioned in a negative light.

Other tweets to rack up millions of “likes” this year included Ariana Grande’s response to the terror attack at her May concert in Manchester, England, and NBA star LeBron James’ zinger at Trump over the president’s rescinding ― via Twitter ― the White House invitation to the league champion Golden State Warriors after some of the team’s players, including star Stephen Curry, said they wouldn’t be attending.

The Twitter champion of the year, however, was Carter Wilkerson — the Nevada teen whose lighthearted request for a year’s supply of chicken nuggets from the Wendy’s fast-food chain went viral. After being shared an astonishing 3.6 million times, it’s now the most retweeted post ever:

A New York Times report published Tuesday night, as well as other reporting in recent months, detailed how Weinstein employed his status as a political power broker to help conceal his years of abusive behavior and intimidate those who tried to blow the whistle.

Weinstein often cited his connections to Democratic politicians, such as donating to and hosting star-studded fundraisers for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The Times reported:

“I know the president of the United States. Who do you know?” Mr. Weinstein, a Democratic fund-raiser, would say during the years Barack Obama was in the White House, adding expletives. “I’m Harvey Weinstein,” he used to say. “You know what I can do.”

Clinton and Obama did not appear to know about Weinstein’s abusive behavior. And like many of his collaborators in the entertainment world, they issued statements condemning him and expressing shock and disgust following the initial Times and New Yorker reports in early October exposing his history of sexual misconduct.

“Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status,” Obama said in a statement shortly after the initial stories.

The Obamas’ eldest daughter Malia, interested in filmmaking, worked as an intern at Weinstein’s production company earlier this year.

Clinton, who benefited from Weinstein’s deep pockets for years, similarly said she “was shocked and appalled by the revelations” about Weinstein and praised the “courage” of the women who spoke out about the mogul.

As recently as this fall, Weinstein and Clinton were working together on a television documentary about her campaign, according to the Times. Clinton scrapped the project as the stories about him emerged, her lawyer said.-1

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) made the decision to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee Tuesday.

An IOC report confirmed “the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system in Russia,” the organization said in a statement. The decision follows a 17-month investigation led by former president of Switzerland Samuel Schmid.

Official record books for the Olympics ― which will take place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next year ― will permanently show that Russia did not win any medals. However, individual Russian athletes will be able to compete wearing a neutral uniform, The New York Times reports.

Russian athletes who qualify will have to meet “strict conditions,” the IOC said in a release, that include drug testing that could go beyond normal Olympic standards. But the Russian flag will not fly, and the Russian anthem won’t play at the games.

Two top Russian officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, have been banned from Olympic involvement for life, while Russian Olympic Committee President Alexander Zhukov’s IOC membership has been suspended.

The lawyer of Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia’s anti-doping laboratory who peeled back the layers of Russia’s state-run doping program in a 2016 New York Times report, said in a statement Tuesday that the IOC’s decision sent a “powerful message.” Rodchenkov’s story is further explored in the Netflix documentary “Icarus” released earlier this year.

“As the world has seen, Dr. Rodchenkov provided credible and irrefutable evidence of the Russian state-sponsored doping system, which was ultimately supervised and financed by then-Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko and other high-level government officials,” lawyer Jim Walden said in a statement. “The decision to bar Russia’s official participation in the Winter Olympics makes abundantly clear to Russia, and all countries, that there are serious consequences for flouting the rules of the international community.”

A livestream taken by Russia Today showed Russia’s Olympic skiing team hearing the news firsthand. Video showed the athletes looking dejected.-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/31/sleepy-after-lunch-we-found-out-exactly-why-it-happens_a_21463330/Sleepy After Lunch? We Found Out Exactly Why It HappensAnd what you can do to pick yourself up (aside from drinking coffee).

You've just enjoyed a tasty burger for lunch and are back at your desk slugging away. Five minutes in and you're overwhelmed with sleepiness, so much so that the space under your desk is looking pretty damn comfy right about now.

But why do we get sleepy after lunch? Is it just because we're full, or is it a sign we're not doing lunch right?

"Feeling a little tired after eating a meal is perfectly normal," Robbie Clark, dietitian and sports nutritionist, told The Huffington Post Australia. "There are a few reasons why we experience the post-lunch slump, but the main reason is due to the digestive process."

Although it might not feel like it, the body uses a fair amount of energy to digest the pasta you've just eaten.

"Our body requires energy to function and survive. We get this energy from our food, which is broken down through the digestive process and converted into fuel, or glucose, and then macronutrients provide calories (or energy) to our bodies. Our digestive system triggers all kinds of responses within our body," Clark explained.

Another reason we may feel sleepy after lunch, or after eating in general, is due to the amount of insulin produced after certain meals, which can trigger our 'happy' and 'sleep' hormones.

"After eating -- particularly sugary foods -- insulin is produced by the pancreas which then converts these sugars (glucose), circulating in the bloodstream into glycogen within our cells," Clark said.

"Excessive secretion of insulin causes the essential amino acid tryptophan to move into the brain. Once in the brain, it leads to increased production of serotonin and melatonin, which are two neurotransmitters that have a calming effect and help regulate sleep. Interestingly, around 90 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, where it regulates intestinal movements."

Accredited practising dietitian Jemma O'Hanlon agrees, saying the amount of carbohydrates we eat at lunch can affect how sleepy we feel afterward.

"Carbohydrate containing foods such as bread, pasta, rice and potatoes boost the production of a neurotransmitter known as serotonin, which can boost our mood but also make us feel content and possibly sleepy," O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia.

Cheese, turkey and bread can all make us feel a little sleepy.

"It's often when we've eaten quite a large meal that we may feel uncomfortable and sluggish, as well, so it's always good to listen to our hunger signals and stop when we feel comfortably satisfied."

Another factor that may contribute to drowsiness after a meal is if you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance.

"Food allergies and intolerances are usually associated with digestive problems such as bloating, gas, reflux, indigestion, constipation or diarrhoea, as well as lethargy," Clark said.

"Finally, general overeating, large portions and the consumption of particularly fatty meals can leave you feeling sleepy because the body has to work overtime and utilise more energy to break down the quantity of food."

On top of these physiological reasons as to why we may feel sleepy after lunch, there are also a few other key foods which can contribute.

The feeling when your lunch order has arrived.

"Though all foods are digested in much the same way, not all foods affect your body in the same way," Clark explained.

"For example, you've probably heard or experienced that turkey can make you sleepier than other foods. Turkey and other high protein foods such as spinach, soy, eggs, cheese, tofu and fish contain higher levels of tryptophan. Studies have shown that cherries (particularly sour cherry) affects melatonin levels, which is the hormone responsible for inducing sleep."

Another sleepiness inducing food is white bread, particularly when compared to whole grain, wholemeal or multigrain bread.

"When you consume white bread your body quickly absorbs the fibre-less starches and refined sugars rapidly, which causes a spike your blood glucose levels. This spike is short lived and results in plummeting blood glucose levels, which can lead to feelings of tiredness and sleepiness," Clark said.

To avoid after lunch sleepiness, Clark and O'Hanlon recommend the following.

The feeling when you've finished said lunch.

1. Don't skip breakfast

We've all been told how important breakfast is for both our bodies and mind. According to Clark, eating breakfast can also help reduce tiredness later in the day.

"If you skip breakfast, it sets the energy standard for the rest of the day," Clark said. "Plus, come lunch time you will be extremely hungry and are more likely to make poorer food choices or have a larger portion."

2. Eat smaller meals throughout the day

"A large meal requires more energy to digest. Instead of eating large lunches, you may want to try eating smaller meals throughout the day," Clark said.

"For example, balance a small lunch with mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks so that you meet your recommended dietary intake of calories throughout the day."

"Eating smaller, more frequent meals across the day can help keep our blood sugar levels steady and give us those regular top ups of energy," O'Hanlon added.

"It's never good to overdo it at any meal, and getting the balance of carbohydrates, proteins and good fats can help fuel us for longer."

Don't forget to fill up on brekkie.

3. Opt for macro-nutrient balanced meals

"Instead of choosing processed foods and starchy sides, make sure that your lunch is balanced and healthy by opting to have a lunch that features colourful vegetables as the main attraction, and a serving of whole grains and lean protein," Clark said.

"Other food tips to avoid slumped energy levels include drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated, avoiding too much sugar and refined carbohydrates, and eating smaller, more frequent meals.

"Also, to help balance blood sugar and insulin levels, choose natural foods that are high in fibre and protein such as whole grains, legumes and nuts."

To know how to choose (or make) macro-nutrient balanced meals, O'Hanlon recommends focusing on the healthy plate model.

"Aim for half your plate to be non-starchy veggies, one quarter to be lean meat or alternatives, and one quarter to be whole grains," she said.

"Often we tend to skimp on the vegetable or salad component, but it's important to get a few serves of our 'five a day' at lunch time and this will help balance the rest of our plate."

Stir fry with brown rice is a winning combo of carbs, fat and protein.

4. Go outside or get moving

Instead of spending your lunch time inside, enjoy your meal outside and, if you can, schedule in a walk.

"Exercise can keep you alert during the day by optimising oxygen and blood circulation around the body and to the brain, minimising the risk of your post-meal slump," Clark said.

"Getting outdoors is also going to help increase oxygenation to the brain."

5. Check in with the doctor

If you're constantly feeling tired and it's affecting your day-to-day life, O'Hanlon recommends checking in with a health professional.

"If you're feeling tired it could be also due to a vitamin or mineral deficiency. For example, iron deficiency, which is very common in young females, particular those not eating meat," O'Hanlon said.

"If you're feeling tired regularly, I'd recommend visiting your local GP and having a general check-up."

http://cnn.com/2017/12/05/opinions/access-hollywood-arianne-zucker-opinion/index.htmlI have no fear, so 'Access Hollywood' tape will never define meArianne Zucker is a film and television actress best known for her work on "Days of Our Lives." Follow her on Twitter: @Ari_Zucker. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) My name is Arianne Zucker. Yes, I am the girl in the "Access Hollywood" video that caused huge controversy last October during the presidential campaign.

Arianne Zucker

Being the "girl in the video" is definitely not the glamorous title I was dreaming about when I was little.

In 2004, I was asked by the television show I was appearing on at the time to welcome the "Access Hollywood" Bus carrying then-citizen and "The Apprentice" star Donald Trump and "Access Hollywood" host Billy Bush. My job was to greet the guests, walk them into the studio where we would be filming, and cross-promote our three television shows. I had no idea about the remarks made before they stepped off that bus until the Washington Post called my management a few hours before the tape was released publicly.

Why do I offer this explanation? To be very clear that I was there to fulfill a job. I could never have predicted what Donald Trump or Billy Bush would say prior to their arrival. Once I saw them get off the bus, my work began. Of course, since we were surrounded by 25 crew members, cameras and a busy schedule, there was no unusual behavior.

Now that the "Access Hollywood" tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/news/economy/brexit-uk-impact/index.htmlBrexit: 3 shocking things we learned this weekThe U.K. doesn't yet know what Brexit means, what economic impact it will have or how to execute it.

These are the big takeaways from a week of turmoil that prevented Prime Minister Theresa May from unlocking the second phase of Brexit talks about the future terms of trade between the U.K. and the European Union.

Negotiations continue, but time is tight: Britain will crash out of the EU if no deal is agreed by March 2019, an outcome that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned Wednesday would be "devastating."

Businesses are preparing to move jobs and investment out of the U.K. in early 2018 if trade talks haven't started.

Nervous investors have pushed the pound down against the dollar this week.

Here's why:

1. Britain doesn't know what Brexit means

The biggest question Britain must answer is what kind of relationship it wants with the EU, its biggest export market, once it has left.

May has made clear that the U.K. will leave the EU's internal market and customs union. But beyond those red lines, little has been settled.

Britain must decide whether it wants to negotiate continued easy access to EU markets or accept significant barriers to trade.

Both scenarios come with economic risks, and political consequences, that are bound to upset factions within May's own party.

Settling on a preferred course of action has been made more difficult by the fact that her cabinet, which has different views on what the "end state" should be, has yet to debate the issue.

"We have not had a specific mandating of an end state position," Treasury chief Philip Hammond said Wednesday.

One example of the resulting confusion: Hammond also said it was "inconceivable" that Britain would walk away from the EU without settling its financial commitments -- in effect, paying a divorce bill that could run to tens of billions of euros.

The prime minister's office countered quickly, saying that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" with the EU.

The risks of putting off the decision too long are profound. Crashing out of the EU without a deal could mean grounded flights, rotting food at the borders and a shortage of parts for automakers in the U.K.

2. The government hasn't assessed the economic impact

Britain's top Brexit negotiator David Davis said Wednesday that his department has not studied how leaving the EU would affect specific sectors of the economy.

"I think ... there's no systematic impact assessment, no," he told a parliamentary committee.

Related: Britain and EU make progress on Brexit divorce bill

Davis defended the government's preparedness, arguing that such studies would "not necessarily be informative" and that their usefulness would be "near zero."

"You don't need to do a formal impact assessment to understand that if there is a regulatory hurdle between our producers and their market, that there will be an impact," he said.

Hilary Benn, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said it was "extraordinary" that Davis had not analyzed the economic impact of such a major event.

Davis said his department had studied the size and scope of industries -- but had not tried to assess how their performance would be affected by Brexit.

Consulting firm Oliver Wyman says 75,000 finance jobs could be lost in the long term if there's no Brexit deal.

Britain's automotive industry has warned that the price of cars imported from Europe would go up by £1,500 ($2,000).

3. There's no clear path forward

May failed earlier this week to move Brexit negotiations on to the critical issue of future trading arrangements.

The prime minister hoped to convince the EU that hard barriers would not return to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.

The deal was scuttled after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up May's minority government, objected.

Irish border: The 'oxymoron' that could derail Brexit

The episode underscores the difficult balancing act facing May.

Her political party is divided on Brexit, and she must keep the DUP happy in order to prevent her government from collapsing.

In addition to the Irish border and the divorce bill, the rights of EU citizens that live and work in Britain, and the rights of Brits who live in the EU, must be settled to the satisfaction of all 27 remaining EU members.

Only then can talks move onto trade. That may not happen now this year.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/06/europe/theresa-may-assassination-plot-intl/index.htmlTheresa May assassination plot suspect in court(CNN) A man who allegedly plotted to assassinate British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared in court Wednesday charged with terrorism offenses.

London based Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, who described himself in court as Pakistani British, was arrested last week and charged on Tuesday.

A second man, Mohammed Aqib Imran, 21, from Birmingham, appeared in court at the same time, also charged with "the intention of committing acts of terrorism." When asked about his nationality in court, Imran said he was Bangladeshi British.

According to court documents, Rahman planned to detonate an explosive device at the gates of Downing Street and then seek to gain access to No. 10 -- May's official residence -- "in the ensuing chaos with a view to trying to kill the Prime Minister."

"The secondary attack on No. 10 was to be carried out with a suicide vest, pepper spray and a knife," the document said.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/12/05/entertainment/johnny-hallyday-obit/index.htmlJohnny Hallyday, the Elvis of France, dies at 74He was 74 years old.

Hallyday had announced that he was being treated for cancer last March, CNN affiliate BFM reported.

"We all have a piece of Johnny Hallyday inside every one of us," a statement from President Emmanuel Macron' s office said. "The public today is in tears, and the whole country mourns."

He is survived by his wife Laeticia and their two daughters, Jade and Joy; his son David from his marriage with famed singer and actress Sylvie Vartan and a daughter from his relationship with actress Nathalie Baye.

While the French Elvis was hardly known by many Americans, in the French-speaking world there was only one "Johnny."

Johnny Hallyday

Hallyday was born to a French mother and Belgian father on June 15, 1943 as Jean-Philippe Smet. He became interested in singing as a teenager after watching Elvis in a movie.

He captivated French young people in the 1960s, introducing them to motorcyles, fast cars and dance moves like the twist.

"The rock 'n' roll attitude which he brought from the US made him an idol to youth of the 60s," Macron's office said. "When the good days of rock 'n' roll were over, the public could have abandoned him but a new life for him began."

His career spanned for more than half a century, filling up stadiums and selling millions of records. An army of fans followed his tours from big cities to small towns.

As the years passed, Hallyday branched out from his rock 'n' roll origins, catching new trends as they came along. He tried practically every musical genre, from R&B and pop to country and acid rock.

Hallyday held a special place on the French music scene. When it came time to commemorate the first anniversary of the terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo, organizers chose Hallyday to sing in tribute.

His health had been declining for years. In 2009, he underwent surgery for colon cancer and months later for a herniated disc. Just after the last surgery, he was treated for an infection in Los Angeles, where he was placed into an induced coma, BFM reported.

After learning of Hallyday's passing, actors and singers around the world expressed their condolences on Twitter.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/06/europe/christine-keeler-obit-intl/index.htmlChristine Keeler, British model involved in Profumo Affair, has died(CNN) Christine Keeler, a former model whose relations during the 1960s Cold War with a British cabinet minister and a Russian diplomat contributed to the downfall of a Conservative government, has died, her son announced.

Keeler's son Seymour Platt posted on Facebook late Tuesday that his mother died the night before, saying she had suffered in recent years from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Keeler was 75.

"As many of you know my mother, Christine Keeler, fought many fights in her eventful life, some fights she lost but some she won," he wrote. "She earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price. We are all very proud of who she was."

Platt told the Guardian that Keeler died in a hospital in Farnborough, a town east of London.

The Profumo Affair

In 1961, Keeler was a 19-year-old cabaret dancer in London when she was introduced to John Profumo. He was the secretary of war, in his mid-40s, and a rising star in Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's government.

Keeler and Profumo began an affair while she was seeing Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet military attache.

Profumo's relationship with Keeler came to light after police investigated an incident involving Keeler.

A former lover of hers fired a gun into a home where she had sought refuge, according to The New York Times . A subsequent police investigation and court proceedings drew out details of her liaison with Profumo.

Initially, Profumo tried to tamp down rumors of an affair. He told members of Parliament in 1963 that there had been no impropriety in his relationship with Keeler.

As rumors spread, and more details were revealed, particularly the possibility that state secrets might have been exposed through Keeler's relationship with the Russian, Profumo confessed to his wife and then to the Cabinet. He resigned that year.

Unable to contain the fallout of the scandal, MacMillan resigned months later. In the national election that followed in 1964 the Tories were defeated by the opposition Labour Party, and its leader Harold Wilson became the next prime minister of the country.

As the scandal filled newspapers and captivated the country, Keeler posed for photographer Lewis Morley. He created an iconic portrait of the doe-eyed brunette sitting, apparently naked, astride a chair. The photo became the defining image of the scandal.

A private life

While Profumo continued to live in the public eye, and was eventually named a Commander of the British Empire for his philanthropy , Keeler was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for making false statements about a different relationship caught up in the Profumo Affair scandal. She served six months in prison.

Christine Keeler stands outside her home in Linhope Street, north west London, shortly after her release from prison on June 9, 1964.

Keeler later published several books, including a memoir called The Truth at Last, with journalist Douglas Thompson. The book was updated in 2012, after Profumo's death.

The Guardian reported that Keeler lived under the name of Sloane for many years and married twice, both ending in divorce. She had two children.-1
http://cnn.com/style/article/russian-modeling-agency/index.htmlHow Russia is changing the face of fashionWritten by Harriet Verney, CNN

In search of distinctive Russian faces, the biggest names in fashion have started turning to one modeling agency in particular -- Lumpen. Less than two years after launching, the Moscow-based company has already cast models in major fashion shows for the likes of Kanye West, Vetements, Lanvin and Comme des Garçons.

But Lumpen's rapidly growing influence stands in contrast to its name. The word "lumpenproletariat" was first used by Karl Marx to describe a low-achieving underclass that was useless to the revolutionary struggle -- including criminals, vagabonds and other outcasts. But the agency's founder, Avdotja Alexandrova, has embraced the term's historical connotations.

"I really related to the word, and warmed to it even more as I began to discover its origins," she said during an interview in Moscow.

Lumpen's model database is comprised of "exclusive Russian faces from all over the world," according to its website. But the agency employs a seemingly broad definition of Russianness.

"We treat the word 'Russian' differently at Lumpen," Alexandrova said. "Most people in our agency are connected to Russia somehow. It could be that their mother was Russian, or they may have been born in Russia. They all, somehow, have a Russian background. But (they) aren't necessarily ethnically Russian."

This approach to diversity may see Lumpen avoid the criticisms levied against some of its clients. Two brands that the agency has worked with, Vetements and Balenciaga, have recently come under fire for their casting choices (the latter's Fall-Winter '16 show featured no black models). But Alexandrova claims that race doesn't come into the question when scouting and casting for Lumpen.

"Skin color doesn't matter," she said. "We have some half-African guys; we have European-type looks. Ethnicity is not the point."

A different model

The agency seems to have a penchant for unforgettable faces. Kanye West used Serva -- a Lumpen model and Alexandrova's boyfriend -- as a fit model for his clothing brand, Yeezus. And of the 12 men that walked in Comme des Garçons' Autumn-Winter 2017 Homme Plus show, eight were provided by Lumpen.

Elsewhere, French brands Jil Sander and Lanvin have enlisted Alexandrova's eye for scouting, while big names like Kenzo and Nike have gone to the agency for both male and female models.

But Lumpen didn't start as a modelling agency. Instead, it began as a database to help Alexandrov and her director and photographer friends find unusual looking faces. As a result, it appears to operate differently from others in the industry.

Lumpen did not begin as a modelling agency and instead was started as a database of interesting faces for photographers and directors to cast from. Credit: Courtesy Lumpen

To begin with, Lumpen charges a mere 20 percent of its models' fees, compared with the 50 percent cut taken by some top agencies. The company also says that it gives people equal casting opportunities rather than dividing its roster into high and low earners.

Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the Lumpen's operation is that its models have a story to tell, Alexandrova posits.

"Everybody in the agency is from the suburbs or the provinces, and has gone through something in life -- usually something that is emotionally straining," she said. "Maybe they were street-raised, or maybe they have done time in prison. (But) ultimately, if we like the face then you're in, regardless of your background."0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/technology/bitcoin-energy-environment/index.htmlThe Bitcoin boom may be a disaster for the environmentBitcoin's phenomenal rise this year may be making speculators very rich, but some observers say it's terrible for the environment.

Once shunned as a murky domain for cranks and criminals, bitcoin has started to attract mainstream investors. Its price has surged from less than $1,000 at the start of the year to above $16,000 on Thursday.

Critics say the cryptocurrency is a "fraud" and they warn of a bubble. Environmentalists worry about another risk -- that it's seriously hurting efforts to combat climate change.

"Bitcoin is slowing the effort to achieve a rapid transition away from fossil fuels," meteorologist Eric Holthaus wrote in an article on environmental news site Grist this week.

Related: What on earth is going on with bitcoin?

Unlike the dollar or the pound, these virtual "coins" aren't tied to a central bank. Instead, bitcoins are "mined" by computers in vast data centers that guzzle huge amounts of energy.

Bitcoin uses about 32 terawatts of energy every year, enough to power about three million U.S. households, according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index published by Digiconomist, a website focused on digital currencies.

By comparison, processing the billions of Visa (V) transactions that take place each year consumes the same amount of power as just 50,000 American homes, according to Digiconomist.

Related: Millions of dollars may have been stolen in bitcoin hack

More worryingly, Bitcoin's energy demands are set to explode.

"As bitcoin grows, the math problems computers must solve to make more bitcoin get more and more difficult," which means more processing power is needed, Holthaus wrote.

And he made a startling forecast: Without a significant change in how transactions are processed, bitcoin could be consuming enough electricity to power the U.S. by the middle of 2019.

Six months later, that demand could equal the world's power consumption.

The fact that most bitcoin is mined in China is also fueling the environmental concerns.

Related: Bitcoin bubble brewing is it still a bargain?

The country's hinterlands have proved attractive for the data centers that bitcoin mining requires because "electricity and land are very cheap," researchers at the University of Cambridge wrote in a recent study.

A lot of the energy in provincial China comes from inefficient, coal-fired power plants that were built in anticipation of big construction projects that never happened, according to the researchers.

Digiconomist reported that the energy demands of one bitcoin mine it visited in Inner Mongolia were equivalent to those of flying a Boeing 747.

Big bitcoin miners have defended their operations, telling the Cambridge researchers that they believe their environmental impact pales in comparison with that of extracting natural resources such as oil.

And more eco-friendly power sources are being adopted. Vienna-based HydroMiner, for example, uses renewable hydroelectric power for its bitcoin operations

But some experts are very pessimistic about the future.

The Chicago Board of Options and Chicago Mercantile Exchange will allow investors to start betting on the future price of bitcoin later this month.

That is expected to prompt a flurry of interest from the big, professional money managers who have so far stayed on the sidelines of the bitcoin party. More demand for the digital currency is likely to push energy use even higher.

"The CME futures may institutionalize bitcoin, which would be disastrous [for the environment]," said John Quiggin, an economics professor at the University of Queensland.

Quiggin believes policymakers won't be able to ignore the fallout for much longer.

"Something needs to be done soon," he said.-1
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/technology/bitcoin-explainer/index.htmlI bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learnedSome people kill time at the airport by browsing duty-free shops. I decided to shop for bitcoin.

But first, there are two things you should know about me: I tend to be almost as afraid of losing money investing as I am of flying. On some level, I figured one fear might cancel out the other.

So last Thursday, while waiting for a flight to Nashville, I pulled up a popular digital wallet application called Coinbase that can be used to buy and sell bitcoin. The virtual currency had hit $10,000 for the first time a couple days earlier, before retreating somewhat. News of bitcoin's rapid rise was everywhere, including on CNN.

For 15 minutes at the airport, I refreshed the price of bitcoin over and over, watching as it gained and lost hundreds of dollars in a matter of minutes. I called out the price fluctuations breathlessly to my wife, who gently encouraged me not to be an idiot, before returning to her magazine.

She was in good company. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently called bitcoin a "fraud" and suggested people who buy it are "stupid." Warren Buffett called bitcoin a "mirage" in 2014 and warned investors to "stay away."

Related: Bitcoin surges $900 in 14 hours. What's going on?

And yet bitcoin has climbed more than tenfold since Buffett's warning. Earlier this month, one college friend casually told me over drinks he'd made tens of thousands of dollars investing in another cryptocurrency. He said he hoped it would be worth enough one day to buy a house.

When I saw the price of bitcoin fall to $9,500, I pressed buy, defying the wisdom of two finance titans and my wife. One hundred dollars, or 0.0101 bitcoins. (A few days later, I bought another $150.) By the time we got to our hotel, my stake had already gone up 10%. One week later, it was (briefly) up 100%. My wife's opinion of me has reportedly decreased by the same amount.

What is happening?

It's an investing frenzy, plain and simple.

Bitcoin cracked $1,000 on the first day of 2017. By this week, it was up to $12,000, and then it really took off: The price topped $16,000 on some exchanges Thursday, and $18,000 on at least one. Other cryptocurrencies have seen similar spikes, though they trade for much less than bitcoin.

There's a long list of factors people may point to in an attempt to explain this. Regulators have taken a hands-off approach to bitcoin in certain markets. Dozens of new hedge funds have launched this year to trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. The Nasdaq and Chicago Mercantile Exchange plan to let investors trade bitcoin futures, which may attract more professional investors.

Related: The bitcoin rally is back on: It just zoomed above $13,000

Yet a key reason the price of bitcoin keeps going up is, well, because it keeps going up. Small investors like yours truly have a fear of missing out on a chance to get rich quick. And when the value of your bitcoin doubles in a week, as it did for me, it's easy to think you're a genius. But you can get burned assuming it will keep skyrocketing.

Some investors have likened the bitcoin hype to the dot-com bubble. Others, like Dimon, have said it's even "worse" than the Dutch tulip mania from the 1600s, considered one of the most famous bubbles ever.

As Buffett put it back in 2014, "the idea that [bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view." Bitcoin is not backed by a company's earnings, or the strength of a government and rule of law. There's also no interest or dividends.

Why would anyone want or need to use bitcoin?

Bitcoin serves as a new kind of currency for the digital era. It works across international borders and doesn't need to be backed by banks or governments.

Or at least that was the promise when it was created in 2009. The surge and volatility of bitcoin this year may be great for those who invested early, but it undermines bitcoin's viability as a currency.

Right now, I can use my bitcoin holdings to pay for purchases at Overstock (OSTBP), or book a hotel on Expedia (EXPE). But if I use bitcoin to buy $25 worth of socks on Overstock today, and the price of bitcoin quadruples next week, I'll feel like those socks actually cost me $100. Then again, if bitcoin crashes, at least I'll always have the socks.

Rather than a currency, bitcoin is being treated more like an asset, with the hope of reaping great returns in the future.

So is there anything truly valuable about bitcoin?

Yes, the technology behind it.

Bitcoin is built on the blockchain, a public ledger containing all the transaction data from anyone who uses bitcoin. Transactions are added to "blocks" or the links of code that make up the chain, and each transaction must be recorded on a block.

Even bitcoin critics like Dimon have said they support the use of blockchain technology for tracking payments.

Is there a legal and legitimate way to invest in bitcoin?

Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack.

Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product.

There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone.

With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer.

My original $100 bitcoin purchase won't officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won't be able to sell at the earliest until Friday.

If the price plummets before then, I'm out of luck. No socks for me.

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/06/media/time-person-of-the-year-2017/index.htmlTime's Person of the Year 2017 is 'The Silence Breakers'Time magazine has named "The Silence Breakers," representing people who came forward to report sexual misconduct, as its Person of the Year.

It's a recognition of the cultural reckoning this year and the #MeToo movement, which represents the people, mostly women, who have fueled a worldwide discussion about sexual harassment and assault.

"This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries," Time's story said.

"These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought."

President Trump was the runner-up for Person of the Year. Chinese President Xi Jinping came in third.

Time's editor-in-chief, Edward Felsenthal, announced the pick Wednesday morning on NBC's "Today."

"It became a hashtag, a movement, a reckoning," Felsenthal wrote in an explanation published on Time's website. "But it began, as great social change nearly always does, with individual acts of courage."

The choice was inspired in part by the #MeToo hashtag, which was created more than a decade ago by the activist Tarana Burke. It took off last month when a slew of high-profile men were publicly accused of sexual misconduct, beginning with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The actor Alyssa Milano tweeted the phrase in mid-October, telling her followers: "If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet." When she woke up the next day, more than 30,000 people had used #metoo, according to Time.

After The New York Times and The New Yorker published accusations of sexual harassment and assault against Weinstein, many more women and some men came forward with allegations against others -- including actor Kevin Spacey, comedian Louis C.K. and former NBC anchor Matt Lauer.

In 2017 women stood up and said #MeToo. We overcame our fears to #BreakTheSilence. Technology and social media have connected us all. We can't turn away from each other's pain. We are connected to it. We are connected to each other. We are connected. THREAD. #TimePOTY — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 6, 2017

Time also pointed to other women who called attention to problems all year long.

In February, the engineer Susan Fowler alleged pervasive sexism and sexual harassment during the year she worked at Uber. The ride-hailing company launched an investigation afterward and fired 20 employees based on its findings.

And in August, pop superstar Taylor Swift won a court case against a former radio host she accused of groping her in 2013. Her testimony was widely covered.

"Going to court to confront this type of behavior is a lonely and draining experience, even when you win, even when you have the financial ability to defend yourself," Swift told Time. "Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances."

The Time cover features five women, including Fowler, Swift and the actor Ashley Judd, who accused Weinstein of misconduct.

It also includes Adama Iwu, a corporate lobbyist from Sacramento, California, who said she was groped in front of colleagues, according to Time.

A fifth woman, using the pseudonym Isabel Pascual, is a strawberry picker who was harassed by a man who threatened to harm her and her children, the magazine said.

Last year Time awarded Person of the Year to Trump, who had just won the election. Time called him the "President of the Divided States of America."

The president tweeted last month that he was "probably" going to be given the title, adding that he "took a pass" because he would have had to agree to an interview and a photo shoot. Time called that account false.0

The White House says "the president is perfectly healthy"

(CNN) While President Donald Trump was giving his historic speech Wednesday to announce that the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, some on the internet focused on the manner in which he made his statement.

Toward the end of the news conference, some on Twitter and Facebook noted that the President's usual speech pattern changed and that he started to slur his words -- and they speculated about what it could mean.

The official term for slurred speech is dysarthria , when the muscles you use to speak weaken or you have a hard time completely controlling their use.

People can slur their words for any number of reasons. It can be a sign of problems with a nervous system disorder like a brain tumor or a stroke. People who have cerebral palsy or Guillain-Barré Syndrome can struggle with slurring. Multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Lyme disease, Huntington's, Myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's and Wilson's disease all can cause it.

Dental work -- such as ill-fitting dentures -- can also be blamed. Medication can impact speech, as can drugs and alcohol. Or people can simply slur their words when they get tired.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/07/health/eclipse-eye-damage-case-study/index.htmlEclipse eye injury: New imaging finds crescent-shaped eye damage(CNN) On August 21, 26-year-old Nia Payne was hoping to view the solar eclipse in Staten Island, New York. What she didn't expect was to end up in the emergency room with a crescent shape blocking the center of her vision.

The eye damage she sustained while viewing the total solar eclipse in August is detailed in a case report published Thursday in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology

A technology called adaptive optics allowed doctors to view the damage on a cellular level and see the microscopic structures in her eyes. Previously, this kind of detail could be seen only with glass slides and a microscope.

An attempt to view the eclipse

Eclipse viewers had been warned to view the event only through special glasses: "Filters that meet the ISO 12312-2 standard reduce the sun's brightness to a safe and comfortable level, like that of a full moon, and block harmful ultraviolet and infrared radiation as well," Rick Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society said at the time. "Solar filters that meet this standard are about 100,000 times darker than ordinary sunglasses, and sunglasses don't block infrared radiation."

However, there was a widespread shortage of eclipse glasses due to the event's popularity, and Payne didn't have any.

Watching the celestial event outside her boyfriend's workplace, she noticed the changes around her, as it looked like dusk during the day. Payne looked up at the sun with her naked eye for a few seconds, but it was too bright.

She approached a woman nearby and asked whether she could borrow her glasses. The woman did not appear interested in viewing the eclipse and said she was "blind as a bat anyway." She told Payne she had borrowed them from a friend and agreed to let Payne use them.

Payne put on the glasses and looked up at the partial eclipse for 15 to 20 seconds. She didn't know what eclipse glasses were supposed to look like, but she remembered that the sun seemed particularly bright -- like looking at it with sunglasses on.

"But it didn't bother me, because I thought it would be a great experience to catch a solar eclipse the proper way," Payne told CNN.

She removed the glasses, returned them to the woman and left.

Six hours later, Payne noticed a weird dark spot in the center of her vision. She told her friends and family, but they told her to wait a day. After all, everyone had been outside looking up at the sun, and it was normal to feel "weird."

The next day, Payne lost vision in the center of her left eye.

A case study develops

She went to the emergency room of a hospital in Staten Island, but she said they didn't appear to take her complaint seriously and wouldn't look at her retina.

A friend suggested Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, and Payne went there two days after the eclipse. From that emergency room, she was referred to specialists at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.

She was diagnosed with solar retinopathy, retinal damage from exposure to solar radiation, in both eyes. It was worse in her dominant left eye; the damage in her right eye was minimal and more manageable.

There is no treatment for solar retinopathy. It may improve or worsen, but is a permanent condition.

The retina is "the camera film of the eye," and it interprets light and turns into electrical energy so the brain can understand it, said Dr. Avnish Deobhakta, author of the new report and an ophthalmologist with the eye and ear infirmary.

Payne asked the doctors whether the damage was from attempting to look at the sun with her naked eye for a few seconds, but they said it looked as though it was caused by staring at the sun for some time.

Doctors believed that the eclipse glasses Payne used were not up to international safety standards. The American Astronomical Society had warned that it had received alarming reports of potentially unsafe eclipse glasses "flooding the market." Some bore a fake stamp to claim that the filters met the ISO 12312-2 standard.

"We saw damage, a change in the center part of her retina, which corresponds with your central visual field, and that is a tipoff for us that there was something going on here related to the eclipse," Deobhakta said.

Doctors used adaptive optics machine to image her eyes, in addition to normal imaging methods, to get a complete picture of the damage.

Adaptive optics were developed by the military to help focus laser beams and then later used on telescopes to reduce the twinkle of stars so they can be seen more clearly. Now, adaptive optics can be used to look at individual cells in the photoreceptor layer of the retina, where the uptake of light occurs before it is converted and transmitted to the brain.

It is also the layer that doctors thought might be most affected by viewing the eclipse improperly.

The images revealed something shocking.

The adaptive optics image of Payne's retina revealed a crescent shape.

"We could see a robust concordance between the shape of the exposed sun during the eclipse and the damage to cells in the photoreceptor layer," Deobhakta said. "When we have a patient who comes in saying they see a dark spot, we have them draw it. She drew a crescent, which corresponded to the exposed sun that was seen in the New York area the day of the eclipse. Then we did an imaging of this layer, and we saw what amounted to a crescent shape of damage to that layer. That really has never been able to be seen before. Our intuitions are shown to be correct by this very precise technology."

Doctors asked Payne whether she wanted to participate in a case study the moment they received the images back from the machine -- on only her second visit to the clinic. Hoping that the findings may help others, Payne agreed.

Dr. Christopher Quinn, president of the American Optometric Association, said the case study's novelty lies in the imaging techniques to characterize and document the retinal damage. And Dr. Jane C. Edmond, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Texas Children's Hospital, said the imaging technique may also have allowed for an earlier diagnosis of solar retinopathy by a few days.

Retraining the eye

Months after the incident, the damage has not changed, for better or worse.

Normal things like reading, driving and watching TV shows or movies have required Payne to retrain her vision. She is training herself to use her right eye as dominant, and she has to be close to the screen in order to watch TV or movies. But if she stares in one place for more than a few seconds, she can see the spot in the center of her vision, and it starts to block out everything else. Reading is the most difficult, she said.

She wore sunglasses for the first couple of months after the eclipse, to manage how bright everything seemed. The brightness and glare of lights at night is the worst, she said.

The spot itself isn't dark anymore, but tends to match the color of whatever she's looking at. Luckily, she still has peripheral vision in her left eye.

Payne is trying to live as she did before.

"So far, it's a nightmare, and sometimes it makes me very sad when I close my eyes and see it," Payne said. "It's embarrassing. People will assume I was just one of those people who stared blankly at the sun or didn't check the person with the glasses. It's something I have to live with for the rest of my life. But it could be a whole lot worse, and I try to count my blessings."

She no longer lives as close to Mount Sinai as she did, but Payne will return in January for followup observation to see whether her vision is improving or worsening on a cellular level.

Deobhakta and the other doctors who participated in the case study are hopeful that adaptive optics will be what allows the possibility of a treatment for solar retinopathy down the road.

"This gives us a door to see conditions in a way we've never seen them before, and that often precedes treatments," Deobhakta said. "There is no treatment on the horizon, but the horizon is only seen when you're able to see it, and I think that's what this imaging helps us to do. Having this technology and looking at the cellular structure would have to be a precondition to do those things."-1
http://cnn.com/2017/12/07/health/flu-vaccine-mmwr-cdc-reports/index.htmlFlu season soars in the US, especially in the South(CNN) After a slow start in October, flu season in the United States is gaining speed, particularly in the South.

Flu activity, which has been increasing since the start of November, is now higher than usual for this time of year, according to a report published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Flu is a contagious, viral illness that causes mild to severe symptoms that, in rare cases, can lead to death. Five children have died, and an additional 566 flu-related hospitalizations have occurred as of November 25.

"Flu is increasing. We're seeing a pretty steep increase in influenza activity across the US but especially in the South," said Brendan Flannery, a co-author of the new report and an epidemiologist in the CDC's flu division.

Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Oklahoma reported widespread activity during the week ended November 25, the report stated.

"We recommend that for everyone 6 months and older, if you haven't received your vaccine yet, now is the time to get it," said Shannon Stokley, an associate director for science in the immunization services division at the CDC.

Despite this guidance, fewer than half of Americans have received a jab this season. Common concerns focus on efficacy of the vaccine and side effects.

Low-tech prevention

"Among the general population, about 39% have received the vaccine," said Stokley, co-author of a new CDC report that canvased people by phone and internet in early November.

Experts believe the flu virus is spread when a sick person talks, sneezes or coughs. Common symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, fever and chills, muscle and body aches, headaches and fatigue. Most people recover in less than two weeks.

However, as Dr. Tanya Altmann, a pediatrician and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, pointed out, the flu has potentially serious complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis and sinus and ear infections.

"Anything that you can do to help prevent your family from getting the flu is very beneficial," said Altmann, who was not involved in the CDC research. Her advice includes the CDC recommendation to get a flu shot, but she also adheres to low-tech techniques of contagious disease prevention: "good hand-washing techniques, teaching kids not to share their germs, staying home when you're sick and disinfecting common surfaces," she said.

Infants and pregnant women, particularly those in the second and third trimesters, are most vulnerable to developing complications, according to the CDC.

"We have some evidence that the vaccination protects the woman from influenza herself, and it can protect the infant in the six months of life from getting influenza before we are able to vaccinate the infant," Flannery said. Both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend flu shots for all women who are or will be pregnant during the flu season.

Many mothers-to-be, though, have not heeded this advice.

Are pregnant women getting 'appropriate' care?

Only one-third of pregnant women have received a flu shot, even though the overwhelming majority of them visited a health care provider at least once, according to another new CDC analysis of data gathered from an internet survey conducted during the first week of November.

More than a quarter of pregnant women reported that medical staff did not recommend or offer a flu shot.

"It makes me a little sad that people across the country -- especially pregnant women -- may not be getting the recommended and appropriate health care," Altmann said.

Coverage was highest for pregnant women whose doctors recommended and offered the vaccine: Just over half of women in this category had received a shot.

Side effects and vaccine efficacy

The CDC -- which lists sore or swollen arms, hoarseness, sore eyes, cough, fever and aches among the most common side effects -- notes that these effects "are usually mild and go away on their own." Extremely rare severe allergic reactions can also occur, according to the CDC.

Among health care workers who declined the vaccine, the most common reason is fear of experiencing side effects or getting sick from the vaccine.

Not everyone agrees that the flu shot is one of the best ways to protect families and prevent serious complications, including Dr. Erika Schwartz, an internist and founder of a medical practice in New York City that focuses on wellness and disease prevention.

Schwartz, who was not involved in the CDC reports, said some of her patients take the flu shot, but others do not.

"Some patients believe the possible side effects outweigh the positives that they get from prevention," she said. Some patients believe they can protect themselves by boosting their immune systems, eating well and making sure they sleep better, she said.

"Everybody's risk is different," Schwartz said. Flannery said highest-risk patients are the elderly, pregnant women and infants, and people who have underlying conditions, such as lung or heart conditions.

And the vaccine is no guarantee of protection. Last year's flu vaccine effectiveness was just 42%, the CDC estimated this year, while preliminary estimates published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggest that this year's vaccine may be just 10% effective.

Flannery explained that the journal article looked at Australia's most recent flu season and highlights the low vaccine effectiveness against one type of influenza: the H3N2 strain predominating in the US today. The article's authors also noted that "the vaccine prevented about a third of all illness by all of the types of flu," Flannery said. "There's still some protection against all flu illness in Australia last season.

"We do see a predominance of the H3N2 virus that was common last season," Flannery said. "H3N2 seasons have been more severe in terms of hospitalization and death, especially in the elderly and young children; that's a concern."

Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said that vaccine effectiveness is not a simple measure.

"When we measure vaccine effectiveness, that's effectiveness against protecting against disease completely," said Schaffner, who was not involved in the CDC research, though he is a liaison representative of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which develops recommendations on the use of vaccines for the CDC.

"What's not measured is that, even if you get the flu in spite of the vaccine, your flu case is likely to be milder; you're less likely to have the complications of pneumonia, having to be hospitalized and dying," he said.-1
http://cnn.com/travel/article/michelin-guide-bangkok-2017/index.htmlBangkok's first Michelin Guide showcases culinary stars(CNN) — Bangkok is no stranger to the Michelin Guide halo -- in fact, visiting chefs touting their overseas star credentials are a regular sight in culinary establishments across the city.

Now it finally has a Michelin Guide of its own.

On December 6, 2017, the Bangkok culinary landscape became brighter overnight -- 20 stars brighter to be exact -- with Michelin accolades dished out to 17 establishments.

Among them is Jay Fai (named after the chef-owner of the street food shophouse restaurant who presides over her open kitchen wearing signature oversized goggles) who was awarded one Michelin star.

The highest accolade was two stars, which went to three establishments -- the progressive Indian restaurant Gaggan, whose inclusion in any best-of Bangkok dining list should come as no surprise to anyone, Le Normandie which opened at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Bangkok in 1958, and Mezzaluna at Lebua Hotel.

Already renowned as a street food destination, Bangkok -- the seventh Asian territory to be rated by Michelin -- has now risen up the culinary ranks to join the likes of Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong/Macau -- even if the Tourism Authority of Thailand did have to dangle a reported 144 million Thai baht ($4.4 million) partnership to get them there.

"Michelin Guide elevates everything"

Le Normandie was one of only three establishments to be awarded two stars at Michelin Guide Bangkok 2018. Le Normandie

The winners of Michelin Guide Bangkok 2018 were announced in a gala dinner at Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok.

Following in the footsteps of Singapore, who was the first country globally to do so, the awards ceremony was complemented with a gala dinner open to the public.

Those who weren't lucky enough to be invited to the Bangkok event had to shell out 20,000 Thai baht ($614) per ticket, which included a six-course gala dinner prepared in part by three chefs from overseas Michelin-starred restaurants.

Chef Chan Yan Tak from the three-starred Lung King Heen at Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, Thierry Marx from the two-starred Sur Mesure at Mandarin Oriental Paris, and Henrik Yde Andersen of one-starred Kiin Kiin in Copenhagen, the latter who "conceptualized" Siam Kempinski's Sra Bua restaurant, all took part.

Other guest chefs included Thaninthorn Chantrawan of Chim by Siam Wisdom, Yannis J. Janssens of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon Bangkok , Chayawee Sutcharitchan of Sra Bua by Kiin Kiin and Bee Satongun of Paste, each of which went on to receive one Michelin star.

The arrival of the Red Guide is considered a positive for the city by restaurateurs and chefs.

"The Michelin Guide elevates everything in one day," said Gaggan's chef Gaggan Anand, who earlier this year announced plans to close his restaurant in 2020 to focus on new projects.

"It changes Bangkok from the street food capital to the gourmet capital of the world."

Melting pot of flavors

Chef David Thompson's Nahm at Como Metropolitan Bangkok received one star. Nahm

A variety of cuisines were represented on the night, including Thai, French, Indian, European, Japanese, German and American.

"Locals are having street food for lunch and fine dining for dinner, and depending on the mood you have a wide choice of cuisines," said chef Thomas Sühring, one half of the duo behind contemporary German restaurant Sühring. "It is with this culinary scene that Bangkok is becoming one that can compete with other great cities in Asia."

Over 15 years ago, Nahm at the Halkin Hotel in London put Thai food on the Michelin map when it was awarded one star not long after it opened in 2001.

The original Nahm has since closed, but proving the star-worthiness of its food, chef David Thompson's second -- and now only -- Nahm at Como Metropolitan Bangkok, was also awarded one Michelin star.

Thai restaurants with Michelin stars are still a bit of a rare breed -- Kin Khao in San Francisco comes to mind, as does Kiin Kiin in Copenhagen.

Considering the country's tourism board partnership with the Michelin Guide, it's perhaps not surprising that Thai food was well represented, with seven of the total 17 Michelin-starred restaurants serving Thai cuisine.

"I'm very pleased that Thai cuisine is represented in the guide, because if you talk about flavors, Thai food has flavors," says chef Norbert Kostner, the former executive chef and later culinary director at Mandarin Oriental Bangkok where for nearly 40 years he helped shaped the fine dining scene of the Thai capital.

Perfectly timed with the arrival of the Michelin Guide, local food has been a core tourism product identified by the Thai tourist board for 2018.

"The Michelin Guide will be a boon for the Michelin star and Gourmand Bib winners, especially for Thai restaurants, as it will provide foreign visitors to Thailand with a trusted resource of recommendations," said Thanaruek "Eh" Laoraowirodge, owner of Supanniga Eating Room, whose three branches in Bangkok plus a dinner cruise serves some of his grandmother's traditional Thai recipes (amongst other things he also co-owner of Somtum Der , whose New York outpost was awarded one Michelin star in 2016.)

Stars on the streets

Bangkok street food vendor Jay Fai was awarded one Michelin star. Jay Fai

If the Michelin stars are categorized as "very good in its category" (one star), "excellence worthy of a detour" (two stars), and "exceptionally worth a long journey" (three stars), then surely there are plenty of street vendors across the city worthy of a two star -- just ask any of the hungry locals who drive across town for their favorite food cart or hole-in-the-wall joint.

A total of 28 street food stalls were included in the Michelin Guide 2018, but only one made it to the Michelin star list -- the one-starred Jay Fai.

The remaining were listed in the Bib Gourmand list, which included a total of 81 restaurants noted for their good value for money with a quality menu not exceeding 1,000 Thai baht ($31). This included Guay Tiew Kua Gai Suanmali, Baannai and Soul Food Mahanakorn

Taste of success

For the winners, the Michelin stars may be the start of a bittersweet journey.

Earlier in the year, chef André Chiang made headlines when he said he wanted to "give back" Restaurant André 's two Michelin stars in Singapore, following a trickle of chefs over the years who have asked to be dropped out of the guide for reasons ranging from the cost, both creative and financial, to maintain the prestige.

Other winners take the accolade with a pinch of salt.

"I am judged for everything I do. But my food is the same on December 5, December 6, or December 7," says Anand, whose restaurant has already topped rival guide Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list three years in a row from 2015-2017.

Any awards, culinary or not, are not without its naysayers, but in the end the diner always wins.

"There's a lot of competition in Bangkok already, but the Michelin Guide will bring it up a bit more, which is good," says Kostner.

The long term Thai resident adds that, when compared to other awards including Asia's 50 Best Restaurants and BK Top Tables , Michelin Guide has the most prestige, but he suspects that coming up with this year's selection would have been a difficult task for the inspectors.

So will Thailand follow in the footsteps of Japan and China, countries with Michelin Guides covering two different territories?

The tourism board has been dropping hints that "other major destinations" may be covered by the guide in following years, but some have their doubts whether other Thai cities are ready for the Red Guide.

"At the moment we believe that the dining scenes in other cities are not strong and developed enough, such as Chiang Mai and Phuket which are considered too much as tourist destinations," says Mathias Sühring.

"However it's just a question of time -- Bangkok has changed so much in only 10 years that anything is possible for the other big cities in Thailand."

http://cnn.com/style/article/turner-prize-winner-2017-lubaina-himid/index.htmlLubaina Himid becomes first woman of color to win Turner PrizeWritten by Nick Glass, CNN

Just when we thought the Turner Prize was getting a bit repetitive, a trifle boring, we get a result to shake things up. Perhaps seismically. For the first time in a long time (aside from the relentlessly predictable cycle of auction records) contemporary art has elbowed its way back onto the front pages -- and thrillingly.

This year's winner is Lubaina Himid. Remember the name.

Himid was born on the island of Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, in 1954. At 63, she is not only the oldest ever winner by almost decade, as well the oldest ever nominee, but also the first woman of color to take the prize. (For the men, Chris Ofili won in 1998, quickly followed in 1999 by Steve McQueen. Both are now in their late 40s.)

And what's more, unlike the other three artists on this year's shortlist, Himid doesn't work and live in London, or any other European capital. No, she lives and works in Preston, Lancashire, where she's a professor of contemporary art at the local university. (The local paper, the Lancashire Evening Post, will surely make a big splash of it.)

All of this -- and much else besides -- makes her newsworthy. And then, of course, there is her art, which celebrates black creativity. In another startling break from tradition, the major piece she's exhibiting at the Turner Prize Show at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull is over 30 years old. Some art critics are likely to tut-tut a bit and question how much the rules appear to have been relaxed: not just older artists now, but old work too. (As I remember it, the Turner Prize used to be expressly about new and contemporary work.)

Himid's big piece is an exuberant installation, "A Fashionable Marriage" (1986), inspired by the paintings of the English satirist William Hogarth's "Marriage A-la-Mode" (1743-45). Himid, a former set designer, created a series of theatrical, life-size plywood figures, satirizing the politics and art of the 1980s. The figures preen, gawp and guffaw across a raised stage. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan are the feted (not to say fated) lovers as the countess and the lawyer Silvertongue.

In a more recent piece, "Swallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service" (2007), a dinner set has been repainted to tell the story of slavery. This time, Himid drew inspiration from the late 18th-century English caricaturists James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, decorating glazed crockery -- plates, jugs, tureens -- with a procession of fat country squires, their complaining wives and a retinue of black servants and slaves.

In another series, "Negative Positives: The Guardian Archive" (2007-17), she has continued to rework old covers of the Guardian newspaper to show that, in her view, they are guilty of black stereotyping. In all probability, she herself will now make the front page of the paper.

At the opening of the Turner Prize show in September, the director of Tate Britain, Alex Farquharson, spoke of the increased interest in the British black art movement of the 1980s. He felt those artists' contributions had not been "recognized as a key aspect of the story of art at the time. Yet increasingly, there is a widespread acceptance that the '80s black art movement ushered in a lot of what we see today." By awarding this year's prize to Himid, the jury seems to be retroactively recognizing its importance.

According to a statement, the jury praised Himid for "her uncompromising tackling of issues including colonial history and how racism persists today." They admired her expansive and exuberant approach to painting, which combines satire and a sense of theater. The jury also acknowledged her role as an influential curator and educator who continues to speak urgently to the moment.2

Architectural Digest has released its annual list of the most important and influential men and women working in interior design and architecture, who are changing the world, one room, one building, and one garden at a time.

Debuting this year are 19 names, one of which opens editor-in-chief Amy Astley's personal selection of 10 highlights from the list. It's Amanda Levete, the award-winning British female architect who's had a banner year with incredible projects: "She completed a mixed-use building called the Central Embassy in Bangkok, but the project that we were most excited by was the subterranean expansion of the V&A Museum in London," said Astley.

Interior designer Monique Gibson also gets the distinction of both debuting on the list and making it into Astley's highlights: "She is the celebrity whisperer of the interior design world," she said.

Danish "starchitect" Bjarke Ingels also features among the highlights: "The project that we were most excited about was the visitors center for the Lego company. He used graphic materials that echo the Lego, which is probably what he grew up playing with."

Chalk it up, perhaps, to the period and stories that series creator Peter Morgan has at his disposal, picking up the 10-episode run in 1956, with an hour that chronicles the strained relationship between Queen Elizabeth II (Claire Foy) and her husband Philip (Matt Smith), with her asking, "what needs to change to make this marriage work."

The series then proceeds, chapter by chapter, through an assortment of fascinating interludes in the late 1950s and early '60s: England plunging into an ill-advised war with Egypt over the Suez Canal; the Royal Family criticized for being out of touch; John F. Kennedy visiting with his glamorous wife Jackie (played by Michael C. Hall and Jodi Balfour, respectively); Elizabeth and Philip sparring over what's best in terms of educating the young Charles; and the government being rocked by the Profumo affair, in which the Secretary of State for War, among others, was undone by a sex scandal.

"The Crown" also continues to document the travails of Elizabeth's younger sister, Margaret (Vanessa Kirby), who meets and takes up with a dashing photographer (Matthew Goode, previously seen wooing Lady Mary on "Downton Abbey"). Then again, when it comes to romance, if Margaret didn't have lousy luck, she'd have positively none at all.

Foy was terrific in year one as well, but at times risked being overshadowed by the larger-than-life figures that surrounded her, starting with Winston Churchill. Here, she's a firmly ensconced queen, albeit one still grappling with the indignities associated with that role in an increasingly modern era, such as her resistance to delivering her annual Christmas message via television.

The article also includes actor Ashley Judd, who was at the center of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations, as well as Rose McGowan, Alyssa Milano and activist Tarana Burke -- pioneers in the #MeToo movement that sparked a global discussion about sexual harassment and assault.

But some users on social media questioned why Swift was on the cover.

Two months before the Weinstein allegations, the singer testified that a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller reached under her skirt and groped her before a concert in June 2013.

Swift's team reported Mueller to KYGO, his radio station, and he was fired two days later. In 2015, he sued Swift, alleging he lost his job because of a false accusation. Swift countersued for $1.

Mueller's lawyer asked Swift on the witness stand whether she felt bad about getting the DJ fired.

"I'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault," Swift said, according to Time. "I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine."

In August, the jury ruled in favor of Swift.

"I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance," Swift told Time.

http://www.wfsb.com/story/37000230/muslim-community-reacts-to-travel-ban-rulingMuslim community reacts to travel ban ruling - WFSB 3 ConnecticutThe Muslim community is reacting to the latest travel ban ruling (WFSB)

A controversial travel ban will go into effect despite efforts to stop it.

The Supreme Court's ruling allows President Donald Trump's plan, which bans those from six countries with mostly-Muslim populations from entering the United States.

There are legal challenges to this ruling, but right now the travel ban is expected to go into effect.

Muslims in Connecticut feel this is a divisive ruling at a time when we should be bringing people together.

"We opened our doors even wider for the people to come in and see who we are,” said Imam Salman Tariq, of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

Salman Tariq is fairly new to Connecticut. He's the new Imam for the Ahmadiyya Muslim mosque in Meriden, but he's familiar with what happened two years ago.

A man living nearby took his anger out on Muslims by shooting at the mosque. Instead of seeking retribution, members sought reconciliation and they made a friend, not an enemy.

Unity is very important to the Muslim congregation of some 300 members, and Imam Salman Tariq said he's deeply disturbed by the travel ban.

Seven of the nine Supreme Court justices have ruled the president's ban can take effect. The countries affected are Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, all countries with mostly Muslim populations. They are banned from entering the United States.

Other courts had partially blocked previous versions of the ban saying they amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination against Muslim.

"There should not be a Muslim ban, or we should not focus on one nationality or ethnicity, otherwise naturally it will create a disturbance and we would like to see a peace in the society,” Imam Salman Tariq said.

He said he feels we should not be singling out any group and that people come to the United States to seek peace and unity.

Two appeals courts plan to hold arguments this week on the ban's legality.

http://miami.cbslocal.com/2017/12/06/tsa-travel-rules-bags-guns/TSA Has A Reminder For Travelers: Leave Your Guns At HomeFollow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter

MIAMI (CBSMiami) — Transportation security officials have a reminder for you – leave your gun at home.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is asking gun owners across the state to be aware of what is in their bags or they might be heading to jail.

“Travelers are reminded that they might be heading to jail rather than to their desired destination if they don’t focus on what is inside their carry-on bags,” said TSA spokesperson Sari Koshetz.

It’s that or a hefty fine.

“Whether or not a passenger is charged criminally, they will face civil penalties …. up to $13,000,” Koshetz told CBS4’s Bianca Peters.

This as a record number of passengers have brought guns to the checkpoints at Miami International Airport (MIA), Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport – and that’s not the scariest part.

“So far this year we have stopped 48 guns at MIA, 62 at FLL and 25 at PBI. The escalation at each airport is not only troubling but dangerous as most of the guns have been loaded,” said Koshetz.

Aside from guns, TSA officers say they confiscate thousands of prohibited items like knives, brass knuckles, and even hazardous materials that are flammable or corrosive from travelers’ bags ever year.

They’re things security officials believe could be prevented by checking your luggage and practicing the 3-1-1 rule.

TSA officials say every time they have to stop a traveler to take prohibited items, it slows down the line for everyone else especially during the holidays.

“This airport screens on average of 59,000 passengers today, around the holidays that number can go up to 75,000 passengers,” said Koshetz while at Miami International Airport (MIA).

A handy tip to speed things up is, if you have electronics larger than a cell phone, make sure to take them out of your bag and place them in a bin.

http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/12/05/palatine-transgender-student-sues-over-locker-room-access/Palatine Transgender Student Sues School District Over Locker Room AccessCHICAGO (CBS) — An 18-year-old transgender student is suing her northwest suburban school district for the right to use the locker room of her choice to change for gym class.

CBS 2’s Mai Martinez sat down for a candid conversation with Nova Maday.

“I’m just like every other girl. I just want to use the locker room. There’s nothing different about me,” Maday said.

It has taken Maday years to talk openly about her sexuality, but the transgender Palatine High School senior is suing Township High School District 211 for not giving her unrestricted access to the girls locker room.

“I feel like I’m being told I don’t belong,” Maday said.

Her fight for equality at her high school began the October of her freshman year, which is when she started living as a girl. Maday says instead of being allowed to use the locker room, school officials said she could change in the nurse’s office or a private area.

She said she has never had any of the other girls tell her they are uncomfortable with her changing in the same locker room and, as a result, doesn’t understand the motives behind the school district.

In a message addressing the lawsuit, Supt. Daniel Cates defended the school district’s stance saying, in part, “The allegations misrepresent the accommodations extended to this student and the District’s overall approach to working with and supporting transgender students. District 211 has provided caring and responsive supports for transgender students for years.”

The statement went on to say, “The Illinois Department of Human Rights has already dismissed this case, stating there was no evidence of discrimination.”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), however, disagrees.

“Nova, as you saw, is a girl. She is a girl just like every other girl, and it is not appropriate for her school district to create limitations on her simply because she’s transgender,” said Ed Yohnka, who’s with the ACLU of Illinois.

The ACLU is helping Maday with her lawsuit. Two years ago, they were successful in a similar action taken against the same school district involving another transgender student.

Their hope is that Maday will be able to use the locker room, without any restrictions, before she graduates.-1
http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/12/05/pay-what-you-can-restaurant/‘Pay What You Can’ Restaurant Opens In Fort WorthFORT WORTH (CBS11) – A new restaurant just opened Tuesday in Fort Worth with the concept “pay what you can.”

And there’s no required tipping! It’s a mission to feed the hungry and nourish their spirits.

Taste Community Restaurant Chef Jeff Williams opened his heart – and his restaurant to customers – regardless of who can pay.

At the end of the meal, customers get a receipt with no price on it. They can pay what they can afford, pay part of the cost or leave the receipt blank.

“You don’t know, looking around, who’s able to afford and who’s not,” says customer Mary Golden. “It’s a great concept.”

“It’s not an easy thing to go to a soup kitchen for the first time,” says Chef Jeff Williams.

Williams would know better than most.

“My dad was a grocery warehouse man. Occasionally, strikes happen with the union. We had periods of time where food was scarce,” recalls Williams. “I remember times when my parents had to skip meals just so my sister and I could eat.”

The restaurant is powered by more than 100 volunteers, like Tonja Spark.

“I don’t think people should ever have to worry about where their next meal is coming from,” said Spark. “It makes me feel good to be part of something new and different.”

There are no prices on the menus. Only a call for more volunteers.

Perhaps someone who enjoyed a meal will be inspired to donate their time and pay it forward.

The chef is hoping to grow the idea. He has plans to open more “pay-what-you-can” restaurants in the future.

Taste Community Restaurant is at 1200 S. Main Street in downtown Fort Worth.2

Kinder Morgan has a pair of pipelines in the area, said spokesman Dee Bennett. The one that was struck is a 20-inch, cross-country transmission pipe. Those are typically buried 4 to 5 feet underground.

"Unfortunately, a required one call notification was not provided to the company prior to the work being performed," read a statement from Kinder Morgan.

A witness, Nathan Hummel, told WQAD News 8 that firefighters started showing up to the area around 9 a.m. and that he could feel the heat about a quarter-mile away.

Hummel said his home is about a mile away from the blaze (as the crow flies).

"I can see the flames from my house... we took off to go find out what was going on," Hummel said. "I thought it was next door because of how big it was."

Hummel described seeing black smoke and flames that were shooting about 150 feet into the air. He said he saw what looked like two burned-up tractors and a pickup truck on fire.

During a mid-afternoon press conference on Tuesday, Dixon Fire Chief Tim Shipman said the fire scene was brought under control around 1:15 p.m. Kinder Morgan officials assisted by cutting off the fuel supply and helping to extinguish the fire.

Shipman said heavy winds during the day actually helped keep the fire away from nearby residences. Although roads near the area were closed as a precaution, no additional residential evacuations were necessary.

The National Transportation Safety Board was notified and will be assisting in the ongoing investigation.

The pain is still fresh for Valley mom Remona Charles who continues to grieve the loss of her 20-year-old son Chezray Young.

Young was killed in a car crash in January 2016 crash near University and Beck Avenue. in Tempe. His passenger was seriously hurt.

Stanley Chu was suspected of drinking and driving and crashing into the back of Young's car.

Charles said she felt like she had a heart attack the moment she recently received a news alert on her phone that Stanley Chu was arrested again, suspected of drinking and driving in Scottsdale. It brought her back to the day she found out her son died and she immediately felt frustrated.

"It (brought me back) to day one all over again. I can't sleep," said Charles.

Chu was out on bond awaiting trial for the 2016 crash when a police officer stopped him in Scottsdale.

Chu was supposed to appear in court on Tuesday, but it was vacated.

“Going to court, almost look like every 30 days, it’s just draining,” explained Charles.

She hopes Chu doesn’t bond out of jail again. She’s worried he could hurt others.

"I would not want another person to endure this pain,” she said. "This pain is unexplainable. Do I feel like he would do it again? Yes. He doesn’t have any concern for anybody."

However, legal experts said there’s not much she can do.

“In this case, because someone had a DUI, even if there was an injury or death associated with that, that wouldn’t be grounds to hold them without bail,” said James Arrowood with Arrowood Attorneys, PLLC.

“But there’s no absolute way when somebody is innocent until proven guilty and they haven’t gone to trial yet, there’s no absolute way that the government under the Constitution to protect other citizens from those people being free and about," added Arrowood.

Right now, Chu is in jail and is still eligible for bail, according to a Maricopa County Superior Court spokesperson.

He’s expected back in court on Feb. 6, 2018.

http://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/12/05/family-reacts-polygamist-sect/Family Reacts After Two Young Girls Found In Polygamist SectBy Rick Sallinger

HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (CBS4) – All four children of Micha Coltharp, who grew up in Highlands Ranch, are safe after their rescue Monday.

They had disappeared with their father three months earlier and hadn’t been heard from. The mother had obtained legal custody following a divorce.

Helicopters scoured the area in northern Iron County, Utah in search of the missing girls, eight-year-old Dinah and four-year-old Hattie Coltharp.

An Amber Alert led to a tip. Iron County Sheriff’s Lt. Del Schlosser credited the response to that alert.

“Had we not received that tip today, these girls probably would not have been alive in the morning,” Lt. Schlosser said.

The girls were believed to be with Samuel Shaffer, a self-described prophet who had two girls of his own. He was found along a road, alone, but he said where the girls could be found.

“An intense search took place trying to locate the two he had kept away from the other two,” Lt. Schlosser added.

Earlier in the day, the two Coltharp boys were located during a raid on a polygamist compound along with Shaffer’s parents who were being questioned. The children’s father, John Coltharp, had already been arrested. That compound appeared to consist of shipping containers.

Grandfather Steve Soble, who lives in Highlands Ranch, worries about what the children have been through.

“There’s no doubt in my mind they have been going through complete indoctrination,” Soble said before the children had been found.

But three months after they were last heard from, they are now safe.

Shaffer was arrested on charges of kidnapping and child abuse.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/larry-nassar-usa-gymnastics-sentence/index.htmlLarry Nassar, ex-USA Gymnastics doctor, sentenced to 60 years on child porn charges(CNN) Larry Nassar, the disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor who admitted to sexually abusing underage girls, has been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on child pornography charges, a court official said Thursday.

US District Judge Janet Neff essentially imposed a life prison term on the 54-year-old physician, sentencing Nassar to 20 years for each of three counts, which are to be served consecutively, according to the docket.

But the child porn charges are not the most serious accusations against Nassar.

In November, he pleaded guilty to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and admitted to using his position to sexually abuse underage girls. Three of those charges related to victims who were under age 13. He will be sentenced on those state charges in January.

More than 140 women and girls have accused him of sexual misconduct, including several American gymnasts on the "Fierce Five" team that won gold at the 2012 Olympics.

Nassar pleaded guilty in July to receiving child pornography in 2004, possessing child pornography from 2003 to 2016 and destroying and concealing evidence in 2016 as he was under investigation, according to the US attorney's office for the Western District of Michigan.

Rachael Denhollander, a former Michigan gymnast who filed the first criminal complaint against Nassar, said after the sentencing that the case represented failures on many levels, from university athletics programs to sports governing bodies.

"It is victim blaming and victim blaming at its finest," Denhollander told reporters. "And that should terrify us. Because ladies and gentlemen, this is the culture of abuse. This is what keeps victims silent. This is what keeps predators in power. And this is what's endangering the next generation of girls."

John Manly, an attorney representing more than 100 victims, said he was proud of McKayla Maroney and other victims for overcoming their fear and facing their perpetrator in court.

"The system failed these women for 20 years," he said.

Andrew Birge, acting US Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, called Nassar an "insidious, hands-on predator" who "treated his license to practice medicine as a license to sexually molest."

"He's getting a natural life sentence," he said. "He is never getting out of prison. He should never have another opportunity to pose a threat to another child."

In a sentencing memorandum last week, prosecutors asked the judge to consider the "full scope" of Nassar's criminal behavior.

"(T)here is a close link between the defendant's child pornography activities and his prolific molestation of children," prosecutors wrote. "The seriousness of his conduct, and the devastating impact it has had on the lives of so many, cannot be overstated."

Nassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics through four Olympic Games, and he worked at Michigan State University from 1997 to 2016 as an associate professor and as the gymnastics and women's crew team physician.

'American tragedy'

Former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar appears in court in June.

In the federal case, prosecutors say Nassar downloaded images and videos of child pornography in 2004 and kept thousands of images and videos -- some of which showed children under 12 -- on his hard drive for years. He then paid $49 to have his laptop wiped of the child pornography and threw away hard drives that contained child pornography, according to court documents.

In return for the plea deal, federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Nassar for sexual exploitation and attempted sexual exploitation of children. Those accusations related to conduct with two minors in Nassar's swimming pool in the summer of 2015 and for "illicit sexual conduct" with two other minor children during interstate and international travel, according to the plea agreement obtained by CNN.

Over the past several months, gold medal winners Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman and Maroney have each spoken out about Nassar's abuse. In a November interview with "60 Minutes," Raisman specifically took aim at USA Gymnastics for allowing the abuse to go on for two decades.

"Why are we looking at why didn't the girls speak up?" Raisman said. "Why not look at what about the culture? What did USA Gymnastics do, and Larry Nassar do, to manipulate these girls so much that they are so afraid to speak up?"

After his guilty plea to criminal sexual conduct charges, attorneys representing more than 100 victims said USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and Michigan State University all "miserably failed" to protect those under their care.

"Make no mistake: This is an American tragedy," Manly said.

USA Gymnastics instituted dozens of changes in the wake of the scandal that the group says will help it prevent and respond to any future cases of abuse.

In April, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs revoked Nassar's medical license for a minimum of three years, according to Jason Moon, communications director for the agency.-1

His accusers were upset he denied some of the accusations

Washington (CNN) In the wake of Democratic Sen. Al Franken's resignation, some of his accusers of sexual misconduct told CNN they are disappointed with his defense of the allegations, saying he shouldn't have continued to dismiss them.

Leeann Tweeden, the California radio morning show anchor who accused Franken of forcibly kissing her and groping her, said she is not celebrating Franken's resignation.

"I'm not celebrating his resignation. It's a lose-lose situation," she said in a phone call with CNN. "I'm not celebrating his resignation but we also can't tolerate hypocrisy. We can't have our leaders saying one thing and doing another."

Asked about Franken's remarks that some of the allegations leveled against him are "simply not true," Tweeden said: "Can you say seven other women are liars and possibly more? I mean, that's between those women and God, who's lying. He's the one stepping down."

Tweeden said she carried Franken's speech on her show. She said she doesn't regret sharing her story.

He also condemned nationalism and populism more broadly

(CNN) The United Nations' top human rights official was "aghast" over President Donald Trump's decision to re-tweet anti-Muslim videos from the far-right ultra nationalist group Britain First last week, offering a robust rebuke of nationalist and populist leaders.

"It seemed to be so foolish," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein told CNN's Elise Labott during a Capitol Hill roundtable discussion for the UN Foundation. "Or it seemed to be driven by a sense of purpose."

"And why take us to a place where what can accrue from this is immense violence?" he asked. "We've been there before."

Al Hussein also condemned nationalism and populism more broadly, saying the international human rights framework, put in place after World War II and the Holocaust, "is under immense stress at the moment" from authoritarian leaders and terrorist groups, but also populist politicians in the west. He derided an increasingly popular school of thought in the western world that suggests human rights efforts have been ineffective and should therefore be tossed aside.

The commissioner -- a former Jordanian ambassador to the United States and United Nations, who has been vocal in calling out abuses in the Middle East as well as other regions of the world -- pointed out tens of millions of people died in two world wars and the Holocaust before the international community came together to develop the Human Rights Declaration, and suggested the world is at risk of returning to the nation-centric dynamic of the early 20th century that allowed that violence to happen.

After Warner Bros. shared a cast photo in November that re-confirmed Depp was reprising his role as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in the series’ second film, The Crimes of Grindelwald, some fans took to social media to criticize the decision. Depp was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife Amber Heard amid a bitter divorce battle in 2016.

Now, Rowling has shared a blog post on her website in which she defends the decision to not recast the role. “I’m saying what I can about the Grindelwald casting issue here,” she tweeted alongside a link to the post.

The huge, mutually supportive community that has grown up around Harry Potter is one of the greatest joys of my life. For me personally, the inability to speak openly to fans about this issue has been difficult, frustrating and at times painful. However, the agreements that have been put in place to protect the privacy of two people, both of whom have expressed a desire to get on with their lives, must be respected. Based on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies.

The author went on to say that she has accepted the fact that some will still be dissatisfied with Depp remaining in the series. However, she believes it is the right choice.

I’ve loved writing the first two screenplays and I can’t wait for fans to see ‘The Crimes of Grindelwald.’ I accept that there will be those who are not satisfied with our choice of actor in the title role. However, conscience isn’t governable by committee. Within the fictional world and outside it, we all have to do what we believe to be the right thing.

“He managed to get every word in the speech right, except the last one,” Colbert said before joking about what a speech snafu might sound like in the future. “I am really looking forward to this Jan. 30. We’re live when Trump addresses a joint session of Congress for the ‘Shshh’ of the Union.”

Colbert later addressed the gravity of the situation and the potential it could have for stirring up political tensions internationally. Because Jerusalem is home to three world religions and both Israel and Palestine claim it as their capital and said that Trump could be making this move to fulfill campaign promises.

http://time.com/5052288/person-of-the-year-past-coverage/?xid=homepageTIME Person of the Year: Past Sexual Harassment CoverageTIME announced its choice for 2017 Person of the Year on Wednesday as the Silence Breakers, a broadly representative group that includes the people around the world who have powered the #MeToo movement and others who have spoken out about sexual harassment and assault, to fuel a reckoning about the treatment of women, particularly in the workplace.

As TIME wrote in the cover story, “this reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries.” From feminist movements in the 1960s and 1970s, to the women who bravely called out Bill Cosby several years ago, to Gretchen Carlson, one of the most vocal Roger Ailes accusers, to the women’s marchers, to the 223 national security experts who recently signed an open letter about their experiences, this moment has been long building.

Here’s a look back at some of the sexual harassment and related coverage from just the past few years:

Women in National Security Sign Letter on Sexual Harassment

Last month, more than 200 U.S. national security experts signed an open letter — first reported by TIME’s Maya Rhodan — saying they had been victims of sexual harassment or assault. “This is not just a problem in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, newsrooms or Congress,” they wrote.

How Do You Solve a Problem Like Harvey Weinstein?

As the wave of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein began to break in October, TIME put the story on the cover.

“In a better world than the one we live in, any performer coerced in this way–made to feel that her career hinged on her sexual compliance at the hands of a powerful bully–would feel free enough to speak up,” Stephanie Zacharek wrote in that issue. “But until shockingly recently, the outcome of doing so was entirely predictable: a woman who spoke up risked losing standing in her profession, or at the very least being labeled a whiner who didn’t know how to play the game. And the man in power would lose nothing. If anything, he’d just grow more powerful.”

The accusations against Weinstein set off a still-growing list of allegations against other male leaders in Hollywood, media, business and politics.

“In the rubble of Weinstein’s empire, we find artifacts divulging so much about our values, our culture and ourselves,” writer and lawyer Jill Filipovic wrote in TIME. “The story they tell is one of stunning hypocrisy and of the slow grind of earth shifting beneath us.”

The Women’s March

The day after Donald Trump’s inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women — and men — marched in Washington D.C. and in all 50 states to protest Trump’s election and the treatment of women more broadly. They seized on Trump’s boasts about groping women without their consent and wore pussy hats that quickly became the iconic symbol of their movement.

Gretchen Carlson’s Next Fight

In 2016, former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit alleging that she was fired from her job for rejecting the sexual advances of Roger Ailes, who was then chairman and CEO of Fox News. The lawsuit fueled more accusations and led to Ailes’ ousting.

“I think this is happening every single day to women in all walks of life and in all different types of corporations,” Carlson told TIME in October 2016. “I’ve heard from so many women, from Wall Street to a tiny little town in Alabama. It’s everywhere.”

As Katie Couric wrote in her entry for Carlson’s inclusion in the TIME 100, “Speaking truth to power is never easy. It’s even harder when the whole country is watching.”

Carlson’s suit shed light on the common use of arbitration clauses in employment contracts — something that can prevent employees from speaking out publicly about sexual harassment. Carlson has since advocated for the the Fairness in Arbitration Act, which aims to enable Americans to hold large corporations accountable for wrongdoing in court.

Accusations against Bill Cosby

Allegations of sexual assault against comedian Bill Cosby resurfaced in 2014 and 2015, when dozens more women came forward with new accusations.

He appeared in court in June, on trial for three felony counts of “aggravated indecent assault” after allegedly drugging and molesting former Temple University basketball staffer Andrea Constand at his home in 2004

Accusers expressed hope, even after the case ended in a mistrial. “We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity,” said Gloria Allred, an attorney who represents several women who have accused Cosby of assault. “But justice will come.”-1

The two also chatted about Robbie’s Australian upbringing and her forthcoming movie I, Tonya, in which she plays controversial Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. And although Robbie said she never actually got on the ice with Harding, it wasn’t because Harding didn’t offer.

http://time.com/5053495/salvator-mundi-painting-saudi-prince-buyer/?xid=homepage'Salvator Mundi' Painting Buyer Revealed as Saudi PrinceThe new owner of Salvator Mundi, the Leonardo da Vinci painting that broke auction house records when it was sold for $450 million last month, has been revealed as the Saudi Arabian prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud.

Bader bin Abdullah was identified in documents reviewed by the New York Times as the buyer of the painting, which was sold at Christie’s in New York on Nov. 15. The prince is not a previously known art collector, the Times reports, and the sources of his wealth are not publicly known, but he is a close associate of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose far-reaching anti-corruption purge last month cleared the way to the Saudi throne.

On Wednesday, the newly opened Louvre in Abu Dhabi museum in the United Arab Emirates tweeted an announcement that the painting is “coming”.

Salvator Mundi has a controversial history, with at least one expert doubting that it is the work of Renaissance master da Vinci. It once belonged to King Charles I of England and disappeared for centuries before resurfacing in 1958, having undergone heavy repainting. It was sold for just thousands in 2005 but was bought again in 2013 for $127.5 million by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Christie’s called the painting’s reemergence “the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 21st century.”

Little is known about Bader bin Abdullah, who lists his primary source of income as real estate. He will pay for the painting in six monthly installments of $58 million, according to the Times.0
http://time.com/5053731/david-ermold-kim-davis-county-clerk/?xid=homepageGay Man Denied Marriage License by Kim Davis Seeks Her County Clerk Job(MOREHEAD, KY.) — David Ermold returned to the Rowan County courthouse Wednesday, nearly two years after Clerk Kim Davis refused to give him a marriage license because he was gay.

Only this time, he did not want a license. He wants Davis’ job.

Ermold filed to run for county clerk on Wednesday, hoping to challenge the woman who two years ago told him “God’s authority” prohibited her from complying with a U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively legalized gay marriage nationwide. Ermold and others sued her, and Davis would spend five days in jail for disobeying a federal judge’s order. She emerged to a rapturous rally on the jailhouse lawn, arm-in-arm with a Republican presidential candidate as a newly crowned martyr for some conservatives.

In the two years since then, things have quieted down in this Appalachian town previously known for a college basketball team at Morehead State University that occasionally qualifies for the NCAA tournament. Last month, Davis announced she would run for re-election and face voters for the first time since refusing to issue marriage licenses. Three other people have also filed to run against her, including Elwood Caudill Jr., who lost to Davis by just 23 votes in the 2014 Democratic primary.

But Caudill, like many people in Morehead, doesn’t want to talk about Davis and gay marriage. Ermold does.

“I think we need to deal with the circumstances and the consequences of what happened,” Ermold said. “I don’t think the other candidates are looking at a larger message. I have an obligation here, really, to do this and to set things right.”

Wednesday, Ermold and his husband sat across a desk from Davis as they filed his paperwork to run for office. Davis smiled and welcomed them, chatting with them about the state retirement system and the upcoming Christmas holiday. She made sure Ermold had all of his paperwork and signatures to file for office, softly humming the old hymn “Jesus Paid It All” as her fingers clacked across a keyboard.

When it was over, she stood and shook hands with Ermold, telling him: “May the best candidate win.”

“It’ll be a good one, I’m sure,” Davis told reporters about the election. Asked if she thought she deserved to be re-elected, Davis said: “That will be up to the people. I think I do a good job.”

Davis doesn’t object to issuing marriage licenses now that the state Legislature has changed the law so her name is not on the license. She has been in the clerk’s office for nearly three decades, most of that time working for her mother until she retired. Davis was elected in 2014 as a Democrat. But after same-sex marriage became legal, the state’s then-Democratic governor refused to issue an executive order to remove the names of clerks from marriage licenses. Davis said she felt betrayed by her party and switched her registration to Republican.

Davis’ new political party could be a problem in Rowan County. While Republican Donald Trump overwhelmingly won the county during the 2016 presidential election, nearly all of the local elected officials are Democrats and always have been.

Tim Keeton, a 56-year-old retired nurse, said he has not decided who he would vote for in the election next year. He said Davis does a good job as clerk, but said he was troubled by her decision not to issue the marriage licenses.

“I think it just blew up and put us in a bad light in a lot of ways,” he said.

Ermold’s candidacy has already attracted some national attention. Patton Oswalt, the comedian and actor, sent Ermold a tweet on Wednesday asking: “Anything I can do to help?”

Ermold grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia and came to Kentucky 19 years ago to be with his boyfriend, now husband, David Moore. He has two master’s degrees, one in English and the other in communications, and teaches English at the University of Pikeville. He says he is more than qualified to run the office, which keeps track of the county’s records including real estate transactions and car registrations.

And he said his campaign won’t focus solely on the LGBT rights. He said he is tired of the “divide and conquer” style of politics that has come to dominate most elections, where candidates purposefully take stances to energize some voters while angering everyone else.

“People … are back home bickering and fighting with each other and fighting on social media,” he said. “This campaign we are putting together is about unity and bringing people together and restoring fairness.”-1
http://time.com/money/5049931/why-this-trillion-dollar-investor-gets-up-at-330-a-m-every-weekday/Why This Trillion-Dollar Investor Gets Up at 3:30 a.m. Every WeekdayRick Rieder thinks sleeping is a waste of time, so he wakes up at 3:30 every workday and gets right down to business.

Rieder is responsible for $1.7 trillion as the chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock, and he isn’t keen to let anyone outwork him. And while Rieder’s wake-up time is just one example of the commitment required to be an investment chief at the world’s largest money manager, it does set the tone for a jam-packed daily schedule.

The first thing Rieder does on waking is check his Bloomberg terminal to see what’s happening in global markets. Then he hits Twitter and scans for the latest headlines and expert punditry. After that he checks his email to catch up on what transpired during his brief slumber. He also trades heavily, because there’s still money to be made while so much of the world is awake and moving markets.

“I tend to trade a lot between 3:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. because markets tend to overreact in those hours,” Rieder said. “Every day is truly insane. There’s not a minute when I don’t have my eye on the markets.”

A hellacious schedule, and a remarkable work ethic

Those first three hours are a mere warm-up for Rieder’s daily gauntlet of calls and meetings.

He hosts a weekly call with his Asia-based team every Monday at 6:30 a.m. That’s followed by a “daily events” call at 6:55, which includes everyone on his teams around the world. And at 11 on Monday, Rieder hosts a meeting to go over macro topics.

At 7:15 a.m. on Tuesday, he holds a meeting for the firm’s investment-strategy group, where he and his colleagues painstakingly cover every asset class managed by BlackRock. Further, each day, at 10 a.m., Rieder has a mutual-fund meeting, where portfolio positioning is discussed. And that’s just a sampling.

Rieder’s hellacious schedule continues in that fashion all week long, starting with broad discussions about strategy before getting increasingly granular. A quick glance at his calendar is enough to make anyone feel overwhelmed, with a color-coded patchwork of endless appointments, one after the other. Not present: many opportunities to come up for air.

But that all pales in comparison to the painstaking preparation that goes into a monthly meeting Rieder hosts, where he leads a discussion about the global-investment regime.

One weekend a month, on both Saturday and Sunday, Rieder wakes up at 4 a.m. and works straight until 6 p.m. He spends that time poring over charts and tables to crystallize the firm’s big-picture framework. In his mind, if he didn’t do this work, he’d be woefully unprepared for his big monthly meeting.

“You get these aha moments when you stare at so many things and they start to come together,” he said. “If you didn’t do the work you’d never get there. It’s not the most socially enhancing experience, but I have to do it.”

Considering how tough these weekends are, you’d figure Rieder would take a load off for the rest of the month. That’s far from the case. Rieder estimates that he spends 10 to 12 hours working on the average weekend.

But surely vacation is a time to relax, right? Well, that really depends on your definition of relaxation.

“When I’m on vacation, I’ll read research reports and business books the whole time,” he said. “My wife says I’m working, but I say I’m not. I enjoy doing this.”

And Rieder’s tireless work ethic doesn’t just stop at the financial realm. He’s also heavily involved in various philanthropic efforts, serving as chairman of the board for 13 charter schools in Newark, New Jersey, as well as for a Graduate Generation public-school association in Atlanta. Rieder is also a trustee for the US Olympic Foundation and sits on the board of advisers for the Hospital for Special Surgery.

A billion little bets

When you consider Rieder’s overall investment strategy, his willingness to dig deep into countless reports and charts makes total sense. Rather than making huge wagers on very specific trades, as many of BlackRock’s competitors do, he prefers to be diversified.

Rieder’s thesis is, if you do an extraordinary amount of work and look at many different areas, you should have no reason to go big into one single position. He likens it to how a casino makes money by tilting the odds in their favor and then processing a huge number of wagers:

“Make a lot of little decisions and little bets and do it billions of times. If you put all your eggs in one basket, you can do well for a while and then it’ll blow up. I don’t believe in that.”

Rieder’s enjoyed an incredible 30-year career since getting his MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business in 1987, after which he started at Lehman Brothers. Within two years of joining Lehman, Rieder had already made a big impression, building the risk system for the firm’s corporate bond trading business from scratch.

He ended up as head of Lehman’s corporate-bond desk and earned his stripes through tough market cycles, in 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002, eventually running the firm’s global credit business. The last position Rieder held at Lehman before the firm’s collapse during the financial crisis was head of the global principal strategies team.

Starting a hedge fund during the financial crisis

While at Lehman, Rieder launched his own hedge fund, R3 Capital Partners. Lehman sold R3 about $5 billion in assets and invested in the firm. In retrospect, he said, launching a fund in 2008, during the throes of a major recession and financial crisis, was an incredibly risky idea. And Rieder concedes that R3 had a tough 2008, as Lehman agreed to sell its stake in the firm in October as part of its bankruptcy case.

But things turned around quickly in 2009, and that escalated discussions Rieder had been having with BlackRock about the firm acquiring R3. The deal ended up getting done in April 2009, and by 2010 Rieder was the chief investment officer of fixed income. Then, in 2015, he moved into the same role on a global basis.

For Rieder, BlackRock was the only option worth considering.

“I wouldn’t have gone anywhere else,” he said. “We wanted to be at the epicenter of markets, and credit markets and BlackRock allowed us to do that.”

When I spoke with Rieder, it was the afternoon before the long Thanksgiving weekend, a time many professionals treat as relaxing holiday.

True to form, he was preparing for a long weekend spent combing through data. After all, that’s what’s relaxing to him.

“I’m working on a big company whose debt has gotten pounded, and I’m going to go through a bunch of spreadsheets,” Rieder said. “I look at it like a puzzle — what’s driving their cash flow. You have to prepare.

“If I didn’t do my work on the weekends, I wouldn’t be ready on Monday morning.”

http://time.com/money/5047491/the-100-best-places-to-work-in-2018/?xid=homepageThe 100 Best Places to Work in 2018 — and the Jobs They Have Open Right NowFacebook is the place to be, according to job website Glassdoor’s new list ranking the 100 best companies to work for in 2018.

Technology is a recurring theme on the list. Other companies span healthcare, consulting, and retail. Bain & Company (No. 2), Google (No. 5), and Apple (No. 84) are the only three employers to score a spot all 10 years that Glassdoor has released the list. Facebook has made an appearance for eight consecutive years.

Why are people crazy about Facebook?

“What we really see them appreciate most is the company’s mission-driven culture, transparent leadership, and the fact that their work literally impacts the lives of billions of people worldwide.” said Glassdoor CEO Robert Hohman of its crowning achievement.

Facebook VP of People Lori Goler, who’s in charge of the company’s global HR organization, says she’s particularly “excited” about leading the Glassdoor list since it’s based on ratings from Facebook’s own employees and reflects its internal culture.

“One of the themes in the reviews is people get great feedback here, they get coaching and room to learn and grow,” she said of the reasons Facebook scored so high. “Another theme is the impact every individual can have. Any job really matters. It’s a strength-based organization, so it matters that people are in roles that play to their strengths. When you put those things together and do it at scale, it’s a pretty magical combination.”

Goler notes that Facebook goes out of its way to instill a belief in clear, honest communication throughout its ranks, including “training for hard conversations” and weekly Q&As led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

There are 40 newcomers to Glassdoor’s list, among them the video game developer Blizzard Entertainment (No. 28), Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants (No. 37), T-Mobile (No. 79), and Adidas (No. 93).

Even fast food received a glowing endorsement, with In-N-Out Burger hitting No. 4 and Chick-fil-A coming in at No. 72 on the list.

Glassdoor compiles its annual Employees’ Choice Awards based on anonymous reviews of companies from current and former employees submitted on its site, which makes it unique among lists like these. Employees are encouraged to share pros and cons of working for their employer, and they rate workplace attributes like career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, senior management, and work-life balance. Ratings for the list are determined by the quantity, quality, and consistency of reviews in the eligibility timeframe (between November 1, 2016 and October 22, 2017).

It might have you thinking about a job switch. If that’s the case, the best news is that Glassdoor has listings of open positions at all the companies.

Below you can see the full list of the 100 best companies to work for along with links to check out available jobs.

http://motto.time.com/5050638/trump-birth-control-rule-rent-the-runway-ceo/Rent the Runway CEO: How Birth Control Helped Me SucceedToday is the last day in the official comment period to voice our opinions on President Donald Trump’s administration’s move to roll back the Affordable Care Act birth control mandate. This is mine — I encourage you to make one, too.

As a woman and the CEO of a company that counts more than 70% of its employees as women, continuing to provide access to birth control coverage is a no-brainer. I do not need to wait to have my employees tell me that they fear losing access to contraception coverage — I know they need and deserve it.

The Trump administration recently introduced a new birth control rule that put the fate of millions of women’s birth control coverage in the hands of their employers, even though a majority of Americans believe that birth control should be treated as a basic aspect of health care. Employers are now able to opt out of providing coverage for moral or religious reasons. This is a direct attack on health care that women rely on, as more than 99% of sexually active women of childbearing age in the U.S. have used birth control.

When I co-founded Rent the Runway, I couldn’t afford work-life balance. Said more simply, 2009 would not have been an optimal year in my life to start a family. I had student loans and minimal financial safety net. I personally relied on family planning when I made the choice to fully focus on building and maintaining the stability of the company for myself and my employees.

If we want half the leadership in every industry to be female, women will have to make bold career steps in their 20s and 30s — the exact timeframe when we’re also encouraged to have children, if we want to be mothers. To accomplish both career and familial goals, every woman needs the ability to plan when it makes the most sense for her to get pregnant. I had my first child eight months ago at the age of 36. It was the right time for me, and I thank birth control for enabling me to control this important choice and its timing.

Many of the gains women have made since the 1960s and 70s — in planning their families, obtaining education, entering the workforce and moving closer to pay equity — have been aided by access to birth control. It’s shocking to me that in 2017, we’re still having this debate.

While women’s health continues to be politicized, companies and their leaders have the power to make a difference. I hope my peers in the business world realize they have a critical role to play in supporting women in the workforce by providing their employees with access to birth control.

Jennifer Hyman is the Co-Founder and CEO of Rent the Runway. Rent the Runway recently joined the growing list of major companies to join the #BusinessForBC campaign and stand with its employees to protect their birth control coverage.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/european-markets-investors-look-to-data-brexit-us-politics-developments.htmlEuropean close slightly higher; Steinhoff tanks 37% to extend lossesThe pan-European Stoxx 600 swung both higher and lower in Thursday's trading, closing up 0.02 percent and with major bourses and sectors pointing in different directions.

Telecoms rallied 1.28 percent with France's Orange leading the charge, closing up 2.32 percent. The company announced Thursday that investments would peak in 2018 at 7.4 billion euros ($8.7 billion) as it spends on networks to grow its customer base.

Banks were 0.85 percent higher.

Europe's travel and leisure stocks did well earlier in the day, eking out some gains in afternoon trade. They closed up 0.53 percent. Shares of Ladbrokes Coral topped the Stoxx 600, up just over 29 percent after bookmaker GVC Holdings offered to buy the firm for £3.9 billion. The move could create an online betting giant from both London-listed brands.

Basic resources stocks were down on softer copper prices, and finished the day's trading 0.24 percent lower.



Steinhoff tumbled to the bottom of the benchmark Thursday. The South African retailer extended dramatic losses from the previous session, after it revealed accounting irregularities and its chief executive resigned. Its shares closed over 46 percent lower Thursday.

In the U.S. the tech-heavy Nasdaq continued to trade higher, led by chip-maker Broadcom's positive earnings report.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/currency-markets-focus-on-dollar-moves-bitcoin.htmlDollar rallies on stronger risk appetite, bitcoin drops to $16,800Markets are now focused on Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, with investors looking at 200,000 new jobs for November, according to a Reuters poll.

"Tomorrow's jobs report will play a significant factor in keeping the (dollar) rally alive and heightening hopes for an early 2018 rate hike," said Lennon Sweeting, chief market strategist at XE in Toronto.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar hit a two-week high of 93.745. It was last up 0.01 percent at 93.62. U.S. Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline.

"Passage of U.S. tax reform is the main upside risk to economic growth, with far-reaching effects," wrote BofA Merrill Lynch analysts in a 2018 outlook.

But although most investors see the tax reform as a pro-growth policy that should support the dollar, not all analysts agree it would be straightforwardly dollar-positive.

"The corporate tax reform has the potential to have a significantly positive effect on the greenback, but due to other parts of the reform - those that are aimed at preventing tax base erosion," wrote Commerzbank currency strategists in a note to clients.0

"If the Social Democrats aren't willing to actually compromise with us on the necessary issues like the question of how we remain a strong economic power … Then there can't be a grand coalition," Jens Spahn, the deputy finance minister, told CNBC Wednesday.

"Still, we, as Christian Democrats, want to govern even in a minority government, that will be new for Germany, but it's time for new things anyway," he added. Merkel herself has previously hinted that fresh elections would be preferable over governing alone.

Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister-party the Christian Social Union (CSU) won 33 percent of the vote back in September's elections, their worst result since 1949. Coalition talks between Merkel, the liberal party and the Greens collapsed, throwing the spotlight onto the the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). The SPD has previously governed with Merkel's party in a "grand coalition" but seemingly wanted to stay in opposition and rebuild after a bruising election result.0

A new report from Nikkei suggests Apple will manufacture three new iPhones next year, including a 6.3-inch iPhone with an OLED screen.



Apple's $999 iPhone X switched from a traditional LCD panel to a more premium OLED screen, which is more colorful, brighter and energy efficient. Apple continued to use LCD panels on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.

Nikkei said Apple will launch 6.3-inch and 5.8-inch iPhone variants with OLED technology, in addition to a 6.1-inch model with a traditional LCD display. The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen, so the 6.3-inch model would be a good deal larger.

Nikkei added that the LCD model will have a metal back, which suggests it might not pack newer technologies such as wireless charging. Apple switched to glass panels on the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X this year to support that feature.

Apple was not immediately available for comment.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the prospect of U.S. athletes participating in February was an "open question."

When asked by Fox News Wednesday night if it was a "done deal" for American athletes to participate in South Korea, Haley replied: "I have not heard anything about that … But I do know in the talks that we have, whether its Jerusalem or its North Korea, it's always about how we protect U.S. citizens in the area."

In a tweet Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said American athletes do plan to participate.

The Winter Olympics are due to be held from February 9-25 in Pyeongchang. The South Korean town is approximately 50 miles from the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) on the border between the two Koreas.-1

"You must keep the gift in the form that you choose, and you can't touch it for 10 years," Paul said in a tweet Tuesday.

The libertarian's followers were provided with four options: U.S. dollars, gold, U.S. ten-year Treasury bonds and bitcoin.

Their answer? Bitcoin.

While Paul hasn't been particularly vocal on cryptocurrencies, the former politician has promoted a retirement fund that lets users invest digital tokens including bitcoin and Ethereum into an individual retirement account.

Experts believe more institutional traders could start to warm to bitcoin as derivatives like futures and ETFs (exchange-traded funds) become the talk of Wall Street.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $15,000 on Thursday. Its price is 1,000 percent higher than that of spot gold per ounce.0

"Bitcoin as a digital currency is not quite there yet," Jerry Yang, who now heads AME Cloud Ventures, told CNBC on Thursday.

"Personally, I am a believer in how digital currency can play a role in our society… but for now, it seems like it's more driven by the hype of investing and getting a return rather than using it as a transaction currency," he said, while speaking on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China.

On Thursday, bitcoin accelerated past the psychologically key level of $15,000. The landmark happened on the Coinbase exchange at 10 a.m. London time (5 a.m. ET), trading as high as $15,200 on that platform.

The digital currency began the year below $1,000 but gains have skyrocketed in recent months as investor interest grows. Bitcoin's dramatic uptick in market value means it would currently rank among the 20 largest stocks in the S&P 500 — with an estimated value of more than $250 billion.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/apple-health-director-anil-sethi-leaves-to-build-cancer-start-up.htmlApple's health boss leaves for new start-up, fulfilling a promise he made to his sick sisterApple's health boss, Anil Sethi, has left the company to start venture focusing on helping very sick patients after his sister died from cancer.

Sethi's medical record start-up Gliimpse was acquired by Apple in August 2016, with Sethi named director of the health team. Sethi also worked at Apple as an engineer in the late 1980s but doesn't credit that as a factor in the acquisition. Instead, he suspects, it was his team's expertise at aggregating medical information, while adhering to federal privacy requirements.

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/jpmorgan-jing-ulrich-consumption-innovation-to-drive-china-growth.htmlJPMorgan explains what's driving China's growthConsumption and innovation will be the two major growth drivers in China in the years ahead as the economic giant moves into its next phase of expansion, a JPMorgan Chase expert said Thursday.

In the next three years, China's consumption will grow from the current $4 trillion to $6 trillion — an addition that is roughly equivalent to the size of Germany's consumer market, said Jing Ulrich, JPMorgan Chase's managing director and vice chairman of Asia Pacific.

On innovation, the Chinese government is not only encouraging technology companies to go abroad, but also urging old industries such as manufacturing to adopt new ways of doing business. That will lift the country's growth prospects, added Ulrich, who is a well-known expert on the world's second-largest economy.

Speaking from the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China, Ulrich highlighted China's newest inventions: "China's payments system is number one in the world in terms of size and sophistication, and also the sharing economy. So we're really seeing innovation taking hold in the whole economy."0

Next year is looking strong for China Southern Airlines, the company's president told CNBC on Wednesday.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Fortune Global forum in Guangzhou, China, Tan Wan Geng, the president of China Southern Airlines, looked ahead to the coming year.

"The common view is our industry is entering a profitable cycle, so we are quite happy for China Southern. We have the very largest fleet [of any Asian airline] and we are confident about the future," he said.

Oil prices, a major cost for airlines, are "stable" for now, Tan said. Looking forward, he said, the company expects crude prices to remain relatively stable.

Tan highlighted his company's interest in Europe, especially given the positive economic situation there: "Right now the information, the message, is the whole Europe economy is recovering. We like to hear that, and we expect that market to recover."0

GVC, which boasts 79 million registered accounts and operates in 21 languages through names such as sportingbet and partypoker, previously bought bwin.party in 2016.

The proposed takeover would give it access to the Ladbrokes, Coral and Gala brands and the combined company would compete with William Hill and Paddy Power Betfair.

The two groups said in a joint statement on Thursday they were in detailed talks over a deal that would give Ladbrokes shareholders around 46.5 percent of the combined group.

Shares in the 230-year-old Ladbrokes jumped 26 percent in early trading, while GVC shares rose 6 percent on confirmation of the long-rumored offer, which is in cash and shares.

The final price will depend on the outcome of a government review into fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The machines are big moneyspinners for companies like Ladbrokes but they have come under fire for leaving gamblers with very heavy losses.

"The enlarged group would be an online-led globally positioned betting and gaming business that would benefit from a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy applied across some of the strongest brands in the sector," the companies said.

"The enlarged group would be geographically diversified with a large portfolio of businesses across both regulated and developing markets, with the scale and resources to address the dynamics of a rapidly changing global industry."0

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is based in the south of France and described by those working on it as "the most complex science project in human history." ITER members include the European Union, the U.S., Russia, China and India.



The project will use hydrogen fusion, controlled by "superconducting magnets," to generate heat energy. This heat is planned to be used in commercial facilities to drive turbines and produce electricity.



According to the World Nuclear Association, fusion power "offers the prospect of an almost inexhaustible source of energy for future generations." The team behind the ITER project said that fusion energy is carbon free, environmentally sustainable and more powerful than fossil fuels.



The first stage of ITER operating as a functional machine, known as First Plasma, is slated to commence in December 2025. ITER scientists have predicted that fusion plants will subsequently come online as early as 2040.



"The stakes are very high for ITER," Bernard Bigot, director-general of ITER, said in a statement.



"When we prove that fusion is a viable energy source, it will eventually replace burning fossil fuels, which are non-renewable and non-sustainable. Fusion will be complementary with wind, solar and other renewable energies."1
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/india-tech-start-ups-ask-for-government-help-as-global-firms-threaten.htmlIndian start-ups beg the government for 'preferential treatment' as global giants eat their lunchCalls for the Indian government to intervene and protect local companies are part of a narrative in the making for more than a year. Notably, at a conference last December, Sachin Bansal, co-founder and executive chairman of Flipkart, suggested that the Indian government should do "what China did 15 years ago and tell the world we need your capital, but we don't need your companies."

Also in attendance at that conference, Bhavish Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of Ola, echoed Bansal's suggestion: "There is a narrative of innovation that non-Indian companies espouse, but the real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital," he said at the time.

Their views were met with a mixed response from industry leaders, some of whom pointed out the irony that both Flipkart and Ola have raised much of their capital from foreign firms. Regardless, some say the stakes are too high for government inaction.

"If the government doesn't wake up, it will see Silicon Valley kill off a large segment of its entrepreneurship ecosystem and challenge its leading retail and technology companies," Vivek Wadhwa, tech entrepreneur and distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, told CNBC.

"Foreign companies will gather massive amounts of private data about every Indian citizen — even more than the Indian government has. Facebook and Google will have the tools to sway Indian public opinion and affect elections. This is dangerous for any democracy," he added, saying he believed the government should learn from China, which he says realized very early on that if it allowed Silicon Valley giants to dominate its internet, they would hurt local companies.

Chinese companies are now rivals to Silicon Valley, and firms like Tencent and Alibaba lead the nation's internet market. Last month, China's Tencent hit a market capitalization of $500 billion.

Along those lines, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of e-commerce and electronic payment company Paytm, recently said in a Twitter post that "India is effectively letting modern world East India Companies own its Internet."

Alibaba-backed Paytm is facing heat from services by global companies. Its wallet application, used by over 200 million users in the country, has seen strong growth of late, but other companies are interested in moving in on the market. Google introduced Tez payments app for India in September, and it has already amassed 12 million customers, the company said. On top of that, Facebook's WhatsApp, used by more than 200 million users in India, is said to be considering plans to integrate a payment option in its app. Paytm declined to comment for this story.

Some warn, however, that replicating an approach similar to that of China could go terribly wrong.

"It is counterproductive to look at China selectively and cherry-pick parts of protectionism we like," said Prasanto Roy, vice president and head of the Internet, Mobile and E-commerce Council at the National Association of Software and Services Companies — an industry group set up in 1988 for India's then-nascent software and IT industry.

"Protectionism is a double-edged sword and any attempt at raising trade barriers could hurt more than help India if there is reciprocal action. Keep in mind that the $150 billion IT industry (two-third of it software and services exports) is premised on an open, non-protectionist global marketplace," he added.

Eyes are on the government now, but not everyone believes New Delhi would pass new laws to help local tech firms.

"The government wants investors and foreign companies to come to India and create more jobs and opportunities in the country. I don't think the government would take any action to hurt foreign companies in any way," said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research.

Officials at the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion weren't available to comment.0
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/07/merck-ceo-on-china-goal-become-innovation-hub.htmlChina's goal to become an innovation hub is good news for Germany's MerckChina has an ambitious plan to become a global leader in innovation and technology, and that could potentially bode very well for German multinational company Merck KGaA.

The company is one of the leading names in science and technology and does business across three sectors: health care, life science and performance materials.

The latter two business units help to make Chinese companies more competitive, Merck KGaA Chairman and CEO Stefan Oschmann told CNBC on Thursday on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China.

"For instance, we are working with Chinese start-ups or larger biotech companies in the manufacturing process and the research process," he said. "Or we're making materials for Chinese electronics manufacturers (and) display manufacturers."

As a result, Oschmann said, Merck KGaA is in a "very interesting place" in the rapidly developing Chinese market.

Earlier this year, industry watchers agreed that China was shedding its image as a country that copies ideas from the West to become a tech and innovation powerhouse. At least one expert said Chinese companies were increasingly innovating in more hardcore technological areas.

When asked if China was becoming stricter toward foreign companies operating within the mainland, Oschmann said he was seeing "a lot more assertiveness and that is only natural given the size of the market and the importance of China in the world economy."

He added that the Chinese government, and business partners, understand Merck's value as a partner in helping to upgrade their industries in areas such as biotechnology and electronics.

One common gripe many foreign companies have when it comes to doing business in China is around intellectual property theft. But recently, Beijing has cracked down on intellectual property rights violations including corporate espionage and counterfeiting of well-known brands.1

Property price gains in China are likely to slow due to official efforts to rein in the market, a top real estate executive said Thursday.

"For years, the Chinese government has had the effort to control the speed of the fast-rising property price, so there's always been policies coming out to control the market, but now this becomes a real nation-wide effort," said SOHO China CEO Zhang Xin.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, China, Zhang said she expects smaller annual price increases in key cities going forward.

Runaway property prices have fueled concerns about the risk of a bubble in the world's second-largest economy for years and present a real level of social risk for the government.

The Chinese government last month indicated that it could implement a property tax in the near future to help curb speculation.

Even so, authorities in Beijing have indicated that they will release land supply for rental and for lower income citizens that will add "a lot more supply" to the market, SOHO's Zhang noted.

Viola, based in Herzliya, Israel, said its fintech fund is backed by a number of international banks, including Scotiabank and Bank Hapoalim, as well as insurer The Travelers Companies.

The project aims to connect financial institutions with fintech start-ups, provide guidance on regulation and accelerate the adoption of new financial technologies, Viola said.

"This fund provides financial institutions with the optimal response to cope with the fast-changing environment," Daniel Tsiddon, founder and general partner of Viola FinTech, said in a statement Wednesday.

"As regulatory, technological and cultural gaps all work to slow innovation adoption, Viola Fintech accelerates the integration of innovative ideas into financial institutions while providing the necessary resources to fintech companies as they scale to transform the financial sector."

Venture capitalists injected $17.4 million in the global fintech sector last year, according to industry body Innovate Finance. Israeli city Tel Aviv has received almost $50 million in funding in the last three years, according to Pitchbook data released in September.

Its report, "Danger in the air: How air pollution can affect brain development in young children," states that breathing in particulate air pollution can both undermine cognitive development and damage brain tissue.



In a statement Wednesday, UNICEF said that satellite imagery showed South Asia was home to the biggest proportion of babies — 12.2 million — living in the worst-affected areas.



The international limits relating to air pollution are set by the World Health Organization (WHO).



UNICEF's paper added that ultrafine pollution particles posed "an especially high risk" as they could more easily enter into the bloodstream and then travel through the body to the brain.



"Not only do pollutants harm babies' developing lungs, they can permanently damage their developing brains, and thus, their futures," Anthony Lake, UNICEF's executive director, said.



"Protecting children from air pollution not only benefits children," Lake added. "It … also benefits their societies — realized in reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity and a safer, cleaner environment for everyone."



The report sets out a range of ways that the impact of air pollution on babies' brains could be lowered.



These include investing in renewable sources of energy to cut air pollution, increasing the amount of green spaces in urban areas, and improving both knowledge and monitoring of air pollution.



The World Health Organization describes air pollution as a "major environmental risk to health." It says that in 2012, outdoor air pollution in cities and rural areas was caused an estimated 3 million premature deaths globally.-1

Chambers said in a video broadcast live on Facebook that he meets with around 40 start-ups each month — generally in areas like artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobility. But he also waxed poetic on the potential of start-up Aspire Food Group, which operates a robotic farm for edible crickets, and drone analytics company Airware -- both of which Chambers invested in.

"I want to change the world, and hopefully that's what I've been fortunate enough to be a part of here at Cisco, and my intent is to do it another time" with start-ups, Chambers said.

Under Chambers' leadership, Cisco became a giant of enterprise technology, with annual revenue approaching $50 billion. Today he holds seats on the boards of OpenGov, Pindrop Security and Cisco.

In the next decade, nearly all job creation will come from start-ups, Chambers said. Beyond that, Chambers said start-ups provide opportunities to boost inclusion.

"At my start-ups, each one of them decides just the basics for every open [requisition], requiring at least one female be interviewed," he said. One start-up he's worked with went from 23 percent female to 34 percent female in 14 months, he said.

Chambers, 68, has been on Cisco's board since 1993. He was Cisco's CEO from 1995 to 2015, at which point he was replaced by Chuck Robbins. In September he told the company and its board that he would not seek to be re-elected to the company's board at the annual shareholder meeting next week, according to a regulatory filing. The board plans to make Robbins its new board chairman, the filing said.

Last month Cisco stock jumped 5 percent after the company reported earnings for the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year. Chambers owns 712,736 shares of Cisco stock, down from more than 3 million in 2014.

"I want to see Cisco be very successful," Chambers said in comments directed at employees. "I want to see you change the world with digitization. I want Chuck and the leadership team to do great things and dream great dreams."0

CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday that he doesn't blame investors for buying into the bitcoin frenzy, but once again he warned that the digital currency's run could end badly.

Earlier this week, Cramer said the cryptocurrency was a pure gamble, and those interested in it should just go to Vegas.

Bitcoin rocketed even higher Thursday morning, crossing the $15,000 mark just 10 hours after topping $14,000, according to industry site CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency, which some market participants have warned is a bubble, has surged more than 1,800 percent this year.

"There's seems to be a level of hoarding," Cramer told "Squawk Box." "People who are owning it aren't flipping it."

"This does feel like it has broken out and it's on liquid oxygen and it's going somewhere," Cramer said. "And I don't blame anyone for wanting to own it because it's a fun ride. And I don't want to talk about when the party is going to be over because maybe the thing is going to Mars. Maybe the thing is going to Jupiter."

"But I do want people to understand that there are mechanics behind this thing that make it so there is no sellers. And if there are no sellers, then it is parabolic," said Cramer, host of CNBC's "Mad Money."

On "Squawk Box" Thursday morning, BK Capital Management founder Brian Kelly, a portfolio manager of a digital currency hedge fund, disagreed with Cramer, saying there's plenty of liquidity on bitcoin trading platforms so would-be sellers won't have problems finding buyers.0

Other Compass investors include Goldman Sachs, outgoing American Express CEO Ken Chenault, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and major property developer The LeFrak Organization, run by billionaire Richard LeFrak.

Robert Reffkin, co-founder and CEO at Compass, told CNBC shortly after the announcement that the company is much more than a real estate company because it's "powering the best of technology."

"Compass is on the path to be the largest owner of real estate data, globally, and the No. 1 real estate technology company in the world," Reffkin said on "Squawk Box."

"We have our own in-house technology team that's building an end-to-end platform for agents to run and manage every part of their business," he said. "Is Amazon a store? Is Tesla a car? I think that distinction is getting a little fuzzier."

"The greatest competitive advantage Panera had, the reason we produced these results we did, is because we could think long term," Shaich told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Wednesday. "And the reason I took our company private is I'm increasingly worried about our ability to do that in a public market."

Shaich, who co-founded Panera and remained at its helm for two decades, highlighted a sea change he's noticed in his 26 years as CEO of a public company.

After issuing and watching the results of more than 100 quarterly earnings reports, the restaurant industry veteran said that traders, not institutional investors, increasingly run the show in the stock market.

"What's driving today's shareholdings are traders on the market," Shaich said. "We had large shareholders like [Capital Research & Management], Goldman Sachs, Baron Funds, but the reality is, they don't drive the price. What drives the price are the traders who are betting on next week's comp. And that affects the entire organization."

"Do you think this is good for economic growth?" the CEO added.

Shaich called attention to the recent upheaval in Buffalo Wild Wings to cement his point. Over the summer, activist firm Marcato incited a proxy fight that ended with the resignation of the chain's CEO, Sally Smith.

Shaich said that Smith called him when the proxy fight started, and they talked about "drawing a line in the sand" to push back against the activists.

"Her management supported her. Her franchisees supported her. She lost the proxy fight, the stock popped 10 percent for a couple of weeks and then it fell 40 percent. And they were forced to sell the company for no more than it was trading at at the beginning," Shaich said.

Shaich expressed his frustration with activists who take minority stakes in companies only in order to boost the stock price in the near term.

As Shaich sees it, the long-term view often serves companies much better than the day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter sentiment that today's market has adopted.

"The greatest competitive advantage of the FANG stocks – Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google – is they have the ability to be long term. They have a capital structure that's long term,' Shaich said. "I think that increasingly, if we're going to have change, we need to really express this. We need to recognize how these markets have changed."0

Piraeus is one of the Greek credit institutions considered solvent but facing "temporary" liquidity problems due to several years of economic crisis in the region. Thus it benefits from the so-called ELA (emergency liquidity assistance), which is credit from the central bank to be used in exceptional circumstances.

Megalou said Wednesday that 2018 should be a "good year for the Greek economy."

"I do expect 2 percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth, I do expect the liquidity to increase and emergency liquidity assistance to reduce significantly and this is a positive effect also on the profitability of the banks," Megalou said in an interview in Athens.

The Greek economy has had three consecutive quarters of growth this year and according to government data out earlier this week, Greece's economy expanded 1.3 percent on a yearly basis during the third quarter.0

The race for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ vacated Senate seat was dominated by several sexual misconduct allegations leveled against Moore, with Jones’ candidacy and record often receding to the background.

You might have heard that Jones was the prosecutor who convicted two Ku Klux Klan members in the 1990s who had been responsible for the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black girls. Here are five more key things to know about Alabama’s new Democratic senator-elect.

1. He was in high school during desegregation of Alabama’s public schools.

Jones grew up in 1960s Alabama, a violent era he cites as the reason why he devoted his legal career to championing civil rights. Jones was a member of student government who worked to build relationships and befriend the newly admitted black students.

2. This sentence appears on his campaign website: “I want to be perfectly clear: I believe in science.”

The career prosecutor opposed President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, and he identified the environment as one of the six key priorities of his candidacy.

“Clean air and clean water are not controversial,” Jones wrote on his website. “They are essential to our health, our prosperity, and our quality of life.”

3. In 1997, President Bill Clinton appointed Jones as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.

Jones was nominated by Clinton, a Democrat, and approved by a majority Republican Senate.

Soon into his tenure, Eric Robert Rudolph bombed a Birmingham abortion clinic, killing an off-duty police officer and injuring another person. Though Rudolph was arrested after Jones left office, the attorney general worked on his indictment.

4. He’s longtime friends with former Vice President Joe Biden, and he worked on Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign.

Biden campaigned with Jones in October and recorded robocalls that went out to voters just before the special election.

“Doug and I have been friends for a long, long time,” Biden told a crowd in Alabama, according to AL.com. “Doug knows Alabama. He knows your heart, and he’ll never let you down.”

The former vice president was also quick to congratulate his friend for his victory.

Doug Jones. Thank you, Alabama. You’ve elected a man of incredible integrity, grit, and character. A fighter for working class and middle class Alabamians. He is going to make you proud in the Senate. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) December 13, 2017

5. Jones’ father was a manager at U.S. Steel. One of his grandfathers was a steelworker, the other a coal miner.

The senator-elect also worked a union job at a steel mill while growing up outside Birmingham.

“The respect I learned for my parents and grandparents ― the hard work they did has shaped my respect for those who work to feed a family ― and try to make their children’s lives better,” Jones wrote on his website.

His family roots also inform his approach to environmental policy, citing the “enormous sympathy” he has for families in Alabama who have lost their jobs as coal prices have declined. Jones has called for job retraining for affected workers.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reporters-prison-committee-to-protect-journalists_us_5a303a85e4b091ca26835e61?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009A Record Number Of Journalists Are Imprisoned Worldwide For Doing Their JobsThe number of journalists imprisoned around the globe hit a record high in 2017, with at least 262 reporters currently behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. They’re guilty of doing their jobs.

In an annual report released Wednesday, CPJ said that 87 percent of those jailed journalists covered political news ― a particularly dangerous beat in many parts of the world. The report’s findings cover media workers imprisoned by state officials in relation to their work as of Dec. 1. Those who died in custody in 2017 or were released prior to Dec. 1 are not included in the year-end total.

For the second year in a row, more than half of those detained are being held in just three countries: China, Egypt and Turkey, the world’s largest jailer of journalists.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan unleashed a stifling crackdown on dissent after a failed military coup in July 2016. His regime has engaged in brutal censorship, including mass arrests and sudden newspaper closures. With a stronger grasp on power than before, Erdoğan even described the attempted takeover as “a gift from God” just days after it happened.

Deniz Yücel, a Turkey correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt, was detained in February. The first foreign reporter to be held in pretrial custody in the wake of the coup attempt, he is accused of “inciting the public to hatred.” Erdoğan reportedly said Yücel is a terrorist because he interviewed a leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has demanded Yücel’s release and vowed that her government will do “everything in its power” to secure his freedom.

“A free and independent press is part of democracy and must never be questioned,” Merkel said, noting that Yücel “did nothing but do his job.”

More than 1 in 4 imprisoned reporters worldwide is locked up in Turkey. Every single one is being investigated for “anti-state” crimes, according to CPJ.

The organization also identified strongmen Xi Jinping and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the respective presidents of China and Egypt, as press freedom predators.

When Beijing unveiled its new generation of leaders in October, it didn’t identify a clear successor to Xi, further elevating his near-absolute authority over the nation of 1.4 billion people. The state of free speech has drastically worsened under his leadership in China, where 41 journalists are imprisoned, per CPJ. Many media workers detained there were arrested after making coerced confessions, according to Reporters Without Borders.

In Egypt, where 20 journalists are being held, a draconian new anti-terrorism law has tightened the government’s strangling grip on the press. Some reporters spend years in detention without being charged or tried, Reporters Without Borders writes.

An outspoken admirer of Erdogan, Xi and Sisi ― despite their well-documented histories of human rights abuses ― U.S. President Donald Trump has also vilified and threatened journalists. His own anti-media rhetoric and his failure to condemn the actions of those authoritarian leaders serve to “reinforce the framework of accusations and legal charges that allow such leaders to preside over the jailing of journalists,” CPJ asserts in its report.

Trump decried the “fake news media” as the “enemy of the American people” in February and has hurled a litany of insults at journalists during his short tenure in the White House. During last year’s election, he denied campaign press credentials to multiple media outlets (including HuffPost), setting the tone for an equally hostile presidency.

“Our task in helping to get reporters freed or prevent the detention of others is made harder by the perception that the United States is not as bright a beacon of press freedom as it once was,” CPJ’s deputy executive director, Robert Mahoney, told HuffPost.

“When President Trump denigrates journalists and dismisses reporting that he does not like as ‘fake news,’ it undermines the value of the press in a democracy and sends a terrible signal to those in power around the world who have few institutional or political restraints on their ability to stifle critical voices,” Mahoney said.-1

Actress Alyssa Milano, who’d traveled to Alabama to canvass for Jones, thanked the state ― one of the nation’s reddest ― through tears. “The country needed this,” she said in a video posted to Twitter.

Late-night host Stephen Colbert called it a “Christmas miracle.” “Scandal” star Kerry Washington said Jones voters had opted for “a more perfect union. A place where we ALL matter.”

In the days leading up to the vote, many celebrities had taken to social media to drum up support for Jones, urging Alabamians to stay on the #RightSideOfHistory to defeat Moore, who has faced weeks of sexual harassment and assault allegations.

Actors, comedians, singers, activists, writers and others took to Twitter to celebrate Jones’ win on Tuesday. Scroll down to see some of their reactions:

Schumer contacted police after multiple news organizations approached his office for comment. Axios was the first to report on the existence of the fake document and the senator’s response.

“This was an apparent effort to dupe reporters and smear a senator — both symptoms of an amped-up news environment where harassment charges are proliferating and reporters have become targets for fraud,” Axios’ Mike Allen reported.

Over the summer, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow had a similar experience and told viewers that her show had received a forged National Security Agency document seemingly filled with explosive allegations. The document, Maddow believes, was sent to her in an effort to discredit her show and other news organizations reporting on Russia’s interference with the 2016 presidential election.

The fake document about Schumer was purportedly signed by a former staffer accusing the senator of sexual harassment. Axios reported the former staffer said her signature on the 13-page document, which was meant to look like a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, was a forgery.

The document had “obvious red flags,” according to BuzzFeed News’ Kate Nocera, who said she had also seen the document.

The former staffer, whose identity has not been released, also told NBC News that she contacted the police over the fraudulent document.

“The claims in this document are completely false, my signature is forged, and even basic facts about me are wrong,” the staffer said in a statement to Axios and NBC News.-1

However the rebels, led by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, want to enshrine the pledge in law by inserting an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill.

May has promised that parliament will be given a vote on the withdrawal agreement.

The prime minister is facing a defeat in the Commons on Wednesday evening as backbench Conservative MPs join with Labour to force the government to give parliament a “meaningful vote” on leaving the EU.

Theresa May has accused rebel Tory MPs of attempting to prevent a “smooth and orderly” Brexit.

Anna Soubry, one of the Tory MPs most likely to vote against the government tonight, urged May to back down in the “spirit of unity”. The Broxtowe MP said during prime minister’s questions: “Nobody wants to be disloyal or bring about more disunity.”

But May rejected the plea. “We will ensure there is a meaningful vote in this House, there will then of course be an opportunity for Parliament to look at the withdrawal agreement and implementation bill,” she said.

She said “as currently drafted”, Grieve’s amendment could end up delaying the legislative process in the run up to Brexit in March 2019 “which could mean we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the EU that we wish to have”.

Soubry, unimpressed, shook her head and said “no” as the prime minister spoke.

Earlier today, Brexit Secretary David Davis attempted to placate Tory rebels with a promise of “a number of votes” on the final deal struck between the UK and EU. However his written statement does not appear to have won over his critics.

Labour is set to back Grieve and urged would-be rebels not to be bought off by “warm words and woolly concessions”.

Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said it was “no surprise” the prime minister had refused to back down.

“Theresa May is running scared and that the government is reluctant to give parliament a vote on the final deal. It is desperate to avoid proper scrutiny and push through whatever it manages to negotiate,” he said.-1

Brexit minister Steve Baker confirmed on Wednesday that MPs could “only vote on the withdrawal agreement” if one was signed with Brussels.

He told the House of Lords Constitution Committee that if the UK and EU failed to agree a deal there would be nothing to vote on.

Baker said parliament had already approved Brexit when MPs and peers voted to trigger Article 50.

“The House of Commons has voted by a large majority to exit the EU on that day [March 29, 2019], that is a decision that has been taken,” he said. “The terms of that were clearly known to parliamentarians at the time.”

He added: “The vote we have committed to is a vote on the withdrawal agreement.”

His comments came after Brexit secretary David Davis wrote to MPs in a last-ditch attempt to avert a Tory revolt and potential Commons defeat for the government’s Brexit legislation.

Theresa May has been warned she faces a rebellion unless MPs are guaranteed a meaningful vote on the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

Rebel ringleader and former attorney general Dominic Grieve believes he has enough support to defeat the government on Wednesday evening unless ministers give in.

Her lack of a Commons majority leaves the prime minister is vulnerable to revolts - and up to 20 Tory MPs are set to side with Grieve.

Backbench Tories who are supporting his amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill include Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry, Jeremy Lefroy, Antoinette Sandbach, Robert Neill, Sarah Wollaston, Stephen Hammond and Heidi Allen.

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Allen said denying parliament a binding vote on the exit deal “would be an affront to the system of democracy we have so proudly exported all over the world”.

Labour is set to back Grieve and urged would-be rebels not to be bought off by “warm words and woolly concessions”.

Davis used a written statement this morning to promise MPs there would be “a number of votes” on the final deal struck between the UK and EU.

But the move appears to fall short of Grieve’s demand that the final deal is enshrined in a statute passed by parliament before it can be put into effect.

The government has said any vote on the withdrawal deal would be on either accepting the deal negotiated by the government, or leaving the EU without a deal.0

Love her or hate her, there’s no denying this year’s series of ‘The Apprentice’ has all been about one person, and one person only - Elizabeth McKenna .

He continued: “She is so domineering and impossible to work with, but the other side of her character is that in many of the tasks, had it not been for her and her strong work ethic and passion - sometimes albeit misguided - the job wouldn’t have been done.

“I think she was somebody who had earned her place to be there, and demanded a certain amount of respect in the interview.”

“You might of thought I’d be harsh with Elizabeth, but you have to look at her endearing qualities,” he said.

Speaking to HuffPost UK ahead of Wednesday’s (13 December) infamous interview episode - where Elizabeth gets off rather lightly during Claude’s grilling - he claimed she deserved to be taken seriously.

Despite remaining po-faced at her antics for the last 11 weeks, Lord Sugar’s right-hand man has admitted he has a lot of time for the domineering florist.

“I first followed her and the girls team in task two, which was the redecoration of the hotel room, and that was the first time you saw Elizabeth being Elizabeth. But all the other girls, without being disrespectful, were utterly useless.

“She took over everything, which she did every single week, but they didn’t know how to hold a paintbrush, or how to put up wallpaper. They were all laughing at her measuring and re-measuring, and it was pretty hysterical, but nothing would have been done if it wasn’t for her.

“Her irrepressible nature means that she takes control, but sometimes it would be better if she let someone else get on with their idea rather than dominating, but that is her character. And in a way, it’s why she’s been kept on.”

Claude’s final five verdict James - “Single-minded and focused on being successful. He’s got a burning ambition.” Michaela - “Great fun and great salesperson. Her ability to sell and not give up on a sale is refreshing. She’s got spirit.” Joanna - “Came to the process too early. Great potential, but too inexperienced.” Elizabeth - “Irrepressible and unmanageable.” Sarah - “Dependable, absolutely reliable and trustworthy.”

While admitting to finding Elizabeth amusing, she may be surprised to hear this, as Claude revealed he has a strict no-contact rule, both on-and-off camera, when it comes to the contestants.

Admitting he is as exactly as you see him on screen, the businessman said: “I never engage, if I can possibly help it, with any of the candidates at any time. I never speak to them.

“I don’t say good morning or goodbye to them - I don’t speak to them at any stage during the process, because I worry if I start saying hello to one of them, another might think they’re the favourite and that’s why they got through. This way, I ignore them all. Sometimes they say hello to me, but I completely ignore them.

“I don’t want them to look to me for any reaction, and if there is any reaction, it is because I can’t help but react. I’m not there to lead them, guide them or give them any encouragement at any stage - that would be very unfair.”0

The now 49-year-old from Enfield, London, has shared his heartbreaking story in the hope it will encourage family members and friends to reach out to those they suspect are battling addiction, especially at Christmas - a time notorious for boozy behaviour. In an interview shared exclusively with HuffPost UK, John recalled: “I was forced into treatment for my addiction after being hospitalised and at death’s door. I had no one looking out for me. “This Christmas, if you think a loved one is struggling with an addiction, give them the gift of support.”

Christmas is difficult for people with alcohol addiction for multiple reasons. “It brings with it an excess of feelings,” Stephanie Keenan, digital manager at Addaction Scotland, told HuffPost UK. “With television broadcasts focusing on togetherness, either with family and friends, it can highlight what people do not have in their lives. “Alcohol misuse is a coping strategy for problematic drinkers. It is the only tool that people have to manage how they feel.” Then there’s the way alcohol is presented in society. “The media often normalises problematic alcohol misuse with adverts broadcasting special offers,” Stephanie added. “With alcohol being at the forefront of supermarket advertising, it’s difficult to walk anywhere without some reference to it.” Combine this with the fact the party season acts as a “smokescreen” for a person’s drinking problem, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol Concern, explained: “If everyone else is knocking it back, someone whose drinking might normally stand out as problematic can blend in more easily. “Someone with an alcohol problem can actually become quite a popular companion for social drinkers – they’re someone who’s always got a bottle open or is always ready to pop to the pub. But clearly that’s not a healthy situation for anyone involved.”

John’s drinking drove his loved ones away (“alcohol came before my child and my partner,” he explained) and, by the time he was 28, he was admitted to hospital with pancreatitis - or inflammation in the pancreas - and told by doctors that if he drank again he would almost certainly die. Looking back, he realises how isolated he was at this point in his life which is why he’s urging loved ones of people with drinking problems to show their support. How is best to address a loved one’s problem drinking at Christmas? It’s thought that one in five people have a family member with a drug or alcohol problem. As well as causing major concern, it can also have a negative impact on a family’s health, wellbeing, finances, social lives and relationships with others, explained Stephanie. That’s why tackling the problem is key to moving forwards. Stephanie said it can be difficult to start a conversation about a loved one’s alcohol use. However once the ice has been broken, crucial steps can be made to help them get better. As a starting point, she said it’s best to avoid mentioning the person’s drinking when they are under the influence of alcohol, as this could result in arguments and increased emotions on both sides. The conversation should be focused around the fact you love and care for them, and are concerned about their health and wellbeing, rather than being confrontational or judging their alcohol use. “Look for opportunities to talk to them about their drinking, such as when they express regret or talk about something bad that has happened when they have been drinking,” she explained. And, ultimately, if they continue to deny their problem or are rationalising their alcohol use, “end the discussion and try again another time”. Thankfully, John managed to get on the straight and narrow - he was voluntarily sectioned, stayed in a mental health unit and then transferred himself to private rehabilitation. Now, he’s celebrating 21 years of sobriety. In this time he’s worked hard to undo all the damage his addiction caused and has rebuilt a relationship with his daughter, who is 23 and has just finished university. Now, the focus is on staying sober. But it’s still difficult, especially at Christmas when the prospect of a tipple is never far away. “It’s surprising how many people think it’s OK to pressure friends and family into drinking,” added Andrew from Alcohol Concern. “Even if you’re feeling festive and would love a drinking buddy, if someone you know seems at all reluctant to have a drink, or if you know that they have struggled with alcohol in the past, drop it.” Addaction has issued tips for remaining aware of people in recovery, such as: offering alcohol alternatives at parties and family gatherings, and being mindful of the alcohol content of sauces, as these may cause those on medication to have a negative reaction (such as vomiting). Additionally, it’s worth noting that if you feel the need to have alcohol during this time of year to enjoy yourself or “have fun”, then it might be worth thinking about your own drinking and seeking some support. As Andrew put it, “it could be any one of us, so sympathy and support is what’s needed when a problem occurs”.

You can also find specialist local services using Alcohol Concern’s local services directory. Some people benefit from joining support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery, and for family members there’s Al-Anon. *John’s name has been changed to protect his identity.

The ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ finalists are currently busy preparing for the grand final, and it has now been revealed what their last dances on the show will be.

As previously revealed, there will be no vote-off part way through the show, meaning each pairing will perform their Showdance, a dance from the series picked by the judges, and a dance from the series of their own choice.

The judges have seemingly picked less well-remembered routines from the contestants’ journeys, hoping they will improve on the scores they received when they first performed them.

Meanwhile, the Showdances are a real mixture of slow and show-stopping numbers.

However, bosses are keeping one element of the final a surprise by not revealing which routine each couple has picked to do again.

Here’s the full list of what they have revealed...

The Judges’ Pick Debbie McGee and Giovanni Pernice will perform a Salsa to ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’ by Boys Town Gang

Alexandra Burke and Gorka Marquez American Smooth to ‘Wouldn’t It Be Lovely’ from My Fair Lady

Joe McFadden and Katya Jones will Viennese Waltz to ‘Somewhere My Love’ from Dr Zhivago

Gemma Atkinson and Aljaz Skorjanec dance the Paso Doble to ‘Viva La Vida’ by Coldplay Showdance Debbie and Giovanni will Showdance to ‘One Day I’ll Fly Away’ by Vaults

Tthe presenter and entertainer died following a long battle with a progressive lung condition, and after hearing the news Noel said he had been “shedding tears” for his former ‘Multi-Coloured Swap Shop’ co-star. In a heartfelt statement, Noel remembered their time working together on the Saturday morning kids show, hailing Cheggers as a “remarkable showman”.

“I’ve lost my first real telly chum and I’m certain I’m not alone in shedding tears for a true telly legend,” he said. “Cheggers and I launched Swap Shop together. Yes, we had the wonderful broadcaster John Craven to keep us in line but it was the chemistry between myself and Keith that initially created the Swap Shop magic that enthralled millions of children every Saturday morning on BBC 1. “Only those who’ve presented live television really know how difficult it is to make it look easy. “I had the luxury of hosting the show from behind the desk in a warm studio but Keith was out on the road in all weathers. He was an extraordinary showman capable of entertaining a vast crowd of excited children during the long periods between his live contributions to the show.”

He continued: “I never saw Keith flustered or lost for words. “In fact now I think about it I never saw him upset or angry. I never heard Cheggers say a bad word about anyone. Like all true professionals he possessed the knack of reinventing himself time and time again.” “He was a very generous performer. Keith was indeed larger than life but he never stole the spotlight. He was an all-round entertainer- a very funny comedian and accomplished musician and singer. “He was at his best on location, with a film crew chasing him and a member of the public about to be surprised on their doorstep. “The greatest achievement for any TV performer is for the viewers to regard you as a friend and today millions will be grateful for Keith’s contribution to their childhood memories and like me they will mourn the passing of a friend.” Noel’s words followed those from their co-star and Keith’s ex-wife Maggie Philbin.

PA Archive/PA Images Keith and Maggie married in 1982

She said in her own statement: “Keith was a one-off – full of life, generous and with a focus on things that mattered – his family. “Keith was loved by everyone who knew and worked with him. I first met him when we did a film about windsurfing when I joined Swap Shop in 1978 and was immediately struck by his fun, energy and kindness. He drove me home to Leicestershire from that freezing lake in Staines, insisting it was on his own way home. (He lived in Twickenham) “He leaves us all with very special memories.” Keith and Noel worked alongside John Craven on ‘Swap Shop’ from 1976 to 1982, with Maggie joining the show two years after it started. The couple went on to marry shortly after the show ended in 1982, going on to have a daughter, Rose, together, before divorcing in 1993. Keith then went on to marry Maria Fielden in 2000, with whom he shared a son, Ted. Many other names from the world of showbiz, including Phillip Schofield, Tony Blackburn and Ricky Gervais, have also paid their own tributes to Cheggers on social media following his death.0

And with Grieve and fellow Tory rebels threatening to stand firm, No10 hinted for the first time that there could be a U-turn to give MPs “clarity” about its intentions.

The former Attorney General told BBC Radio 4′s World at One programme: “I don’t see any possibility of me backing down on this at all. One has to stand up for one’s principles.

Asked how many Tory backbenchers agreed, he replied: “I think enough, if this comes to a vote, to defeat the Government.”

A White House spokesperson dismissed the rumors.

“His throat was dry. There’s nothing to it,” Raj Shah told the Los Angeles Times.

“Report whatever you would like to report,” Shah said. “This isn’t news.”

However, the issue sparked much discussion on social media, particularly after “The Daily Show” segment.

Unfortunately, that’s often overlooked, said Ronald A. Alexander, a psychotherapist in California and Colorado and the author of Wise Mind, Open Mind: Finding Purpose and Meaning in Times of Crisis, Loss, and Change.

“You’re not alone if you take to your bed and feel withdrawn from the world,” Alexander said. “A broken heart can leave one feeling as if they have lost their rudder to the ship of their self. Crying and sobbing is common, as well as feelings of melancholy, but there are physical symptoms, too.”

Dealing with a broken heart, at least in the initial stages, often wreaks havoc on your sleep schedule. Sleep disorders like insomnia are common for the recently single, Alexander said. The stress of a breakup can keep you on edge, interfering with the biological processes that normally help you fall asleep at the end of the day.

“When you’re suffering from a broken heart, it can be very difficult to quiet down your mind, shut it down and get some rest,” he said.

Anxiety and increased heart palpitations often go hand in hand with a broken heart as well, Alexander added.

“It’s important to know that the sadness and grief of a broken heart can kick up and flood the nervous system,” he said. “It’s very normal for this state of hypoarousal to trigger feelings of loss of control.”

And in some extreme cases, a breakup could lead to heart attack-like symptoms. Broken heart syndrome ― or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as it was first described in Japanese medical literature in the 1990s ― is a temporary heart condition that looks and feels like a heart attack and is often brought on by stressful situations, like the death of a loved one or a breakup.0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/12/08/bitcoin-bubble-watch-currency-passes-us-16-000-and-the-pace-is-accelerating_a_23301188/Bitcoin Bubble Watch: Currency Passes US$16,000, And The Pace Is AcceleratingThe value of bitcoin, the digital currency that you probably just recently heard about, shot through the US$16,000 mark on Thursday. To put this in context: The currency broke through the $1,000 mark in February of this year.

If you've only recently come across it, bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency — there are no physical bitcoins, only ledgers stored in the cloud. No government controls the currency, and its use is anonymous. Bitcoins are created through software that "mines" them by solving time-consuming math problems. This is done to create scarcity, giving the currency value.

And what value it has: Bitcoin has seen a 16-fold increase in price in 10 months.

And the rate of growth is accelerating at a breakneck pace. Earlier this year it took a few months for bitcoin to add another US$1,000 in value; in the past day it's been adding that much every few hours.

Bet you wish you had bought some bitcoins a year ago, when they were trading under US$800.

But don't feel too jealous, because we're calling it, folks: This is a classic asset bubble. Prices are accelerating and are completely unsustainable. A correction is inevitable.

We're not the only ones saying it. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz told Bloomberg that he sees bitcoin as "a bubble that's going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down."

Bitcoin update:



$0000 - $1000: 1789 days

***

$6000- $7000: 13 days

$7000- $8000: 14 days

$8000- $9000: 9 days

$9000-$10000: 2 days

$10000-$11000: 1 day

$11000-$12000: 6 days

$12,000-$13,000: 17 hours

$13,000-$14,000: 4 hours

$14,000-$15,000: 10 hours

$15,000-$16,000: 5 hours — zerohedge (@zerohedge) December 7, 2017

Stiglitz called for the cryptocurrency to be outlawed, because "it doesn't serve any socially useful function."

He's not the only one who's worried. Prominent financial experts such as Morgan Stanley's former chief economist, Stephen Roach, and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have warned that bitcoin is a big, fat ugly bubble.

But not everyone sees it that way. The true believers say bitcoin can still be worth much, much more. MGT Capital Investment CEO John McAfee predicted recently that bitcoin will soar to US$1 million by 2020. He and others point out that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins mined, implying that their potential value could be very high.

Fear of missing out

That belief that bitcoin could be worth much more could be justified, or it could be another sign of the irrational euphoria that falls over markets when a truly lucrative bubble forms.

According to Dave Chapman, managing director of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Octagon Strategy, bitcoin's rise is driven by the same thing that drives just about every speculative bubble: The expectation that prices will keep rising. Investors are experiencing "FOMO," or "fear of missing out," and are racing to invest before prices go any higher.

"There is admittedly a lot of speculation in this market," he said, as quoted at CNN.

Some news reports have suggested that demand in Japan and South Korea, particularly, is driving up bitcoin prices.

Part of what's giving investors confidence in the currency is the hands-off approach that governments seem to be taking to the currency, Chapman said.

Gaining legitimacy

Also, cryptocurrencies are quickly gaining legitimacy. Investors will soon be able to trade the currency on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the NASDAQ exchange is planning to roll out bitcoin futures trading next year.

The Bank of Canada issued a report earlier this month on the potential of cryptocurrencies, and the possibility of governments issuing their own. Though it didn't land on either side of the argument, the report found some potential benefits to the move.

"With no transaction fees charged by the central bank, the benchmark [cryptocurrency] would probably be less expensive for merchants than cash and credit cards."

The million-dollar question for investors now is: When will the bubble burst?

"We are in the throes of a bubble market, and one of the characteristics of a bubble market is that there is no way to know when the bubble will burst," said Mick McCarthy, CMC Markets chief market strategist Mick McCarthy told CBC News.

Simply put, buyer beware.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/carli-jay/i-lost-half-my-body-weigh_b_9560554.htmlI Lost Half My Body Weight (The Good Old-Fashioned Way)For 28 years of my life, I lived happily every day -- doing what I wanted and living each day like it was my last.

I was the life of the party, always having fun and enjoying myself. Nothing stopped me, not even my 127 kg body weight.

At 28 years old, I had grown to a whopping size 24-26. I was morbidly obese, but that wasn't new to me -- I had been overweight my entire life. But it wasn't until I realised my health was suffering that I decided to do something about my overall well-being and ever-growing body size.

Carli weighed 127 kg in 2014.

In February 2014 I was living in London. I woke up one cold and rainy morning to a numb tingling sensation down the right side of my body, and pins and needles in my hip. I realised it was because of my sheer mass -- I was getting no circulation across my body while I slept.

My joints would ache throughout the day, throbbing headaches were a daily occurrence and I was falling asleep at my desk. I worked a 50-60-hour-a-week job, which was exhausting, and all I ever wanted to do in my free time was sit on the couch, watch TV and eat. I was consuming around 4000 calories per day -- over double the daily recommendation for a woman.

So it was that day in February that I decided to shift myself from the couch to my dusty old exercise bike in the corner of my lounge room and start cycling away to my favourite television programs. And from that day forward, I decided I could take control of my health and weight.

I realised I didn't have to be big my entire life, like I once thought. I made the commitment to myself to lose half my body-weight the good old-fashioned way -- through living the healthy life -- getting active, eating well, getting good nutrition, plenty of sleep and taking care of my well-being.

And that is exactly what I did.

I began working out for 10-20 minutes a day, then increased it to 40 minutes a day and so on, until the point where I was exercising twice a day because I purely enjoyed it. I had increased my fitness levels and introduced this new habit into my life.

Through all of this dedication, sticking to my goal and putting in the hard work -- with no gimmicks, fad diets or surgery -- I am pretty proud to say this year in February, exactly two years on, I hit my goal of losing 63.5 kg. I did it all on my own, with no help from anyone.

Carli lost 63.5 kg, half her body weight, in two years.

I started documenting my journey in mid 2015 through my Instagram blog @misscarlijay_healthyliving to motivate others to do the same. No matter how big or small your health, fitness or life goal may be, be persistent and consistent and you will get there.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/06/africa/human-ancestor-little-foot-unveiled-intl/index.htmlAncient human ancestor 'Little Foot' unveiledJohannesburg, South Africa (CNN) South Africa's Cradle of Humankind, an expanse of farmland and rolling hills outside Johannesburg, has already unlocked some of the great mysteries of evolution. The unveiling of a near-complete fossil hominid skeleton dating back 3.67 million years will only solidify the importance of the region.

"Little Foot" is the oldest fossil hominid skeleton ever found in Southern Africa, the lead scientist examining the discovery said on Wednesday.

The fossil skeleton takes its name from the small foot bones discovered by scientist Ron Clarke in 1994 when he was sorting through bones in boxes from the Sterkfontein cave system. Even then, Clarke surmised that the fossilized bones came from an Australopithecus species -- the smallish, ape-like human ancestors that roamed this part of Africa millions of years ago.

In 1997 he found more bones in a cupboard at the medical school of the University of the Witwatersrand. The rest of Little Foot was found embedded in the calcified ancient cave in 1997 and the excavation, cleaning, reconstruction, casting and analysis took 20 years. Much of the work was done deep inside the cave system, working away at concrete-like rock called breccia, using air scribes to avoid breaking the fragile and priceless fossil remains.

Thanks to their governor, they now have a dedicated official to oversee their "happiness and purpose fulfillment."

Governor Rochas Okorocha named the official, who just happens to be his sister, during a swearing in ceremony on Monday.

Ogechi Ololo was initially named 'Commissioner of Happiness and Couples Fulfillment," much to the delight of social media users who wondered exactly what the function of this new role would be.

What does the Commissioner for Happiness and Couple's fulfilment do?

"This is happening," she remembered thinking. "Our houses are burning down. We need to start rebuilding."

Fortunately, Masterson was one of the lucky ones. Firefighters beat back the flames around her neighborhood in Ventura, California.

But her community was in tatters. And Masterson knew she had to do something.

So, she posted a plea on Facebook for people to drop off donations at her home. Blankets, towels, clothes. Anything she could take to shelters.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/12/us/keaton-jones-bullying-video-reaction/index.htmlHow Keaton Jones' bullying plea brought him more bullying(CNN) It started off so neatly: the perfect story to cap a rocky year, a reminder that commonality exists in the face of division.

On Friday, an 11-year-old Knoxville, Tennessee, boy woefully recounted to his mother his experience with middle-school bullies. His mother posted the teary plea online and citizens across the internet responded en masse to say: Keaton Jones, we've got your back.

Now, in place of that solidarity lie confusion, questions and anger.

The mother's old social media postings have spurred cries that she's a bigot. The same internet that carried the staunch encouragement of Keaton's defenders is now rife with accusations that, by default, Keaton, too, must be a racist. In a vicious about-face, the internet citizens -- who, just days prior, stood sentry between a weeping 11-year-old and five middle-school misanthropes -- turned on him.

He deserved what he got, they growled. Maybe he should be bullied more.

Kimberly Jones is appalled. Those Confederate flag photos on Facebook were jokes, she said, from 2½ years ago. They were meant to be self-deprecating. But Jones doesn't care what folks think of her.

Keaton Jones tearfully tells his mom about his day at school.

"Even if you think the worst thing about the mother, these are kids," Keaton's mother said in a Tuesday phone interview.

Her son is no racist, she said. She's never heard him utter a racial slur, and no administrators at the predominantly white Horace Maynard Middle School have ever reported such behavior, she said.

She'd like to guarantee he's never said such words, but being a mother of three, including Keaton's 8- and 18-year-old sisters, she's heard things come out of her kids' mouths that stunned her. She'd be "very disappointed" to learn Keaton had used a hateful pejorative, she said, before her son interrupted the interview.

"Hold on. He's standing right here," she said, pausing. "He says it hasn't (happened)."

'It's not OK'

The video began in the passenger seat of Jones' vehicle. His cheeks pink and eyes pleading, Keaton recounted the torment he suffered at the whims of his classmates. They mocked his nose, called him ugly and said he had no friends. They threw milk on him, put ham down his clothes.

"Just out of curiosity, why do they bully?" he asked. "What's the point of it? Why do you find joy in taking innocent people and finding a way to be mean to them? It's not OK."

His tears became sobs. He closed with a message to both bullies and the targets of their ridicule.

"People that are different don't need to be criticized about it. It's not their fault," he said. "But if you are made fun of, just don't let it bother you. Just stay strong, I guess. It's hard, but it'll probably get better one day."

So I got the chance to spend the day with my new best bud Keaton. It was unbelievable to get to know him and realize that we have a lot in common. This dude is very special and has changed my life forever. Now I have the little brother I always wanted! God bless you my man pic.twitter.com/vMHVtnf2rC — Jarrett Guarantano✞ (@BroadwayJay2) December 11, 2017

The post snared millions of views. The internet passed swift judgment in young Keaton's favor. #StandwithKeaton began trending. Athletes and entertainers rushed to his defense.

We're not talking middleweights or B-listers, oh no. We're talking Captain America and the Biebs, J-Lo and Posh Spice, Cardi B, Snoop Dogg and Rihanna, anti-bullying stalwarts such as Demi Lovato and Katy Perry.

In a trying year that revealed natural disasters of all shapes, a spooky nuclear showdown and the sexual predation by beloved entertainers, even the daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the son of President Donald Trump agreed: This boy's treatment was intolerable.

@Lakyn_Jones Hello, Keaton (via your sister)! You may have heard of my parents, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (#MLK) and #CorettaScottKing. I try to honor them and their legacies. I'm so sorry about the pain you're experiencing because of bullying. You matter. I love you. — Be A King (@BerniceKing) December 9, 2017

This boy is incredibly brave and the video really got to me. @danawhite, If he takes you up on your offer to see UFC Headquarters, I would be honored to host him and his family at our place if they need somewhere to stay. https://t.co/EWx05o0yI0 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) December 11, 2017

The Tennessee Titans invited Keaton to a football game . The quarterback of his hometown Tennessee Volunteers showed up to hang out. He got invitations to Pixar Animation Studios, the UFC headquarters and Walker Stalker Con. Avengers offered to take him to the "Infinity Wars" premiere in Los Angeles.

James Carter, director of Union County Public Schools, issued a statement saying the district investigates all reported incidents and "will not tolerate bullying." Hundreds of miles away, a New Jersey father of two, Joseph Lam, set up a GoFundMe account where almost 2,000 people donated $58,000, possibly to send Keaton to private school or college.

Stay strong, Keaton. Don't let them make you turn cold. I promise it gets better. While those punks at your school are deciding what kind of people they want to be in this world, how would you and your mom like to come to the Avengers premiere in LA next year? https://t.co/s1QwCQ3toi — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) December 10, 2017

Lam didn't know the Joneses. He set up the fundraiser Saturday after watching Keaton's plea three times, he said. Via friends, he reached Jones on Sunday to tell her about it.

"Any parent has this in the back of their mind," Lam said. "We just moved to a new school district. My son and daughter, I worry about them fitting in to the school. ... They shouldn't have to worry about this; (they) should be able to go to school and learn and play and have fun."

The backlash begins

Keaton Jones is pictured in a photo taken by his mother in July 2015.

On Monday, though, past social media posts by Jones surfaced, and the troll gates opened.

One of Jones' missives was addressed to "butthurt Americans" and said, "If you aren't bleeding, no bones are sticking out & you can breathe, STOP crying!" Posted about two weeks after white supremacists converged on Charlottesville, Virginia, many on social media took it as commentary on the Unite the Right Rally that turned deadly . (Jones insists it was not meant as anything of the sort.)

Two other posts included the Confederate flag. In one, Keaton is pictured with a group of children, one holding a puppy, another the stars and bars of the Confederate banner. A girl posed with a toy gun. Keaton wielded an American flag. Another photo showed Jones grinning broadly next to an unfurled Confederate flag. Both photos are from July 2015.

Cardi B and other celebrities who had defended Keaton disappeared their posts on Instagram supporting him. Rihanna, who had called Keaton a hero and thanked the "young king" for inspiring others, deleted the post. In its place, she posted another anti-bullying message featuring images of Rosalie Avila, 13, and Ashawnty Davis , 10, both of whom killed themselves.

"We're losing our babies to bullying!!! Teach your kids love and equality," Ri wrote.

Jones and her son were roundly cast as villains -- and anyone who supported them, as a fool who'd been duped by the money-grubbing mother plying her child's pain for profit. Keaton was accused, without evidence, of hurling epithets at black classmates and bringing the bullying on himself.

Hateful threats and name-calling abounded. No need to rehash any specific vitriol here. Anyone with a few fingers and an internet connection can find it, but suffice to say, it was enough to make Jones wish she'd never posted Keaton's tearful plea. Her children don't even want to leave the house now, she said on Monday.

"People are threatening to kill my children," she said. "We went from the most amazing family in the country to the worst."

'How ironic is this?'

Kimberly Jones poses for what she called an "ironic" photo in July 2015.

In reality, Jones said, hers is an average family. She cleans homes and offices and does odd jobs to make ends meet. Her eldest daughter is about to graduate. Her youngest is having her tonsils out later this month. Keaton, she said, likes superheroes and Legos.

The August "butthurt" post had nothing to do with Charlottesville, she said. It was about people who look for the negative in everything, she said. She was imploring folks to toughen up, just like she had with Keaton on occasion, including on the day he called from school saying he needed new clothes because he'd "spilled" milk on himself.

"I said, 'Be more careful. Stand under the dryer. I can't get there right now,'" she recalled. "He told me what really happened when I picked him up."

As for the Confederate flag posts, they were meant as jokes, she said. She and the family were at the lake on July 4. They're Southerners, and the country was engaged in a debate over the Confederate flag.

"Lord, we ought to take a picture," she thought at the time, "of the all-American redneck family and pull out all the props."

The other photo, taken that same weekend, shows her laughing alongside the flag, as if to say, "How ironic is this? Because I'm so not that person," she said.

Asked her thoughts on the Confederate flag, she said she understands its importance to many Southerners, and she wouldn't condone banning it because taking away people's freedom is a slippery slope. At the same time, despite being a Christian, she also opposes putting the Ten Commandments in schools because it creates a slippery slope in another direction, she said.

"You've got to be really careful with what you take and what you give because we share this world," she said.

'It was just as innocent as that'

As for the video that started it all, Jones said Keaton's emotion was authentic and encouraged those who sympathized and empathized with him not to let his message die.

Keaton had been experiencing trouble with five bullies. The milk and ham incidents came days before Thanksgiving.

Jones had contacted the school and been told it wouldn't happen again, she said, but Keaton had implored her to back down. He didn't want to be labeled a tattletale.

She and Keaton had previously discussed making a bullying video, for his teachers or friends. On Friday, a girl, one of his bullies, was passing out graded papers and "told him a boy was going to beat him up," prompting Jones to remove Keaton from school early, the mother said.

Jones stopped to pick up lunch afterward and Keaton told her, "'Mama, I think I'm ready to do that video.' It was just as innocent as that." She didn't make it public until one of her 600 Facebook friends told her it might help others, she said.

The outpouring of support was overwhelming. She was elated to see so many people rush to her son's aid, she said. She was equally disheartened by Monday's backlash. She plans to keep Keaton out of school until January, and his teachers at Horace Maynard are working with her to make sure Keaton stays up to date on his classwork, she said.

"I'm trying to maintain my family and remind them that we know who we are," she said.

She hasn't been on the internet much since Monday. It saddens her that celebrities she admires might think the worst of her, she said.

"I really don't want Snoop to think I'm racist. I wanted him to bring Martha (Stewart). I was hoping we could do some porch-sitting," she said.

Not everyone has rescinded their support for Keaton. He was scheduled to hang out with some of the Tennessee Titans on Tuesday afternoon, his mother said early in the day.

"He's pretty excited," Jones said. "I think it's going to be pretty low-key."

Tight end Delanie Walker is still inviting Keaton to attend the Titans' December 31 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jones doesn't know if she can attend because her 8-year-old's tonsil surgery is two days prior, but she's going to try to make it work.

Lam, who started the GoFundMe campaign, stopped taking donations on the page, but he says that's only while he works with GoFundMe on how to proceed with the fundraiser. In an update on the website, he defended Keaton and his mother.

"THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE MOM!! However passing judgment on her before you know her is a form of bullying," he wrote. "We have to be the voice for the voiceless. In the video I saw a kid crying not just for himself but for others. To me that's a kid with a heart of gold and deserves praise."

Even some of Keaton's celebrity supporters said they still stand with him. Actor Patton Oswalt said so in a series of tweets and clapped back at a commenter who questioned how Oswalt could support the kid if his family members were a "bunch of racists."

"Keaton didn't get to choose the family that raised & shaped him, you smug ghoul. How 'bout showing him that people of all races & creeds can come together? Change things, maybe? Show him a better world?" Oswalt tweeted.

And while rapper T.I. said he wouldn't donate money to Keaton's family, he took to Instagram to say, "I STILL support Lil dude."

"while his family is spewing hatred around him... he himself will be able to speak from experience how much LOVE was shown to him on the gram by the very ones he's been taught to (DESPISE)!!!" the rhymesmith wrote.-1

http://www.fox10tv.com/story/37044249/doug-jones-working-hard-for-conservative-votesDoug Jones working hard for conservative votes - FOX10 News | WALASenate candidate Doug Jones hasn’t given up hope that a win in ruby red Alabama isn’t so hard to accomplish.

“A democrat’s gonna win,” Jones said Monday in Montgomery, “and the reason is because people are getting past that. We have had so many people now who have gone beyond the party.”

Jones continued to hang his hat on the fact that Republican Senator Richard Shelby, of Alabama, said he did not vote for Jones’ opponent, Roy Moore, whose campaign has been marred by sexual misconduct allegations against him.

“Also, listen to people like Richard Shelby, who has been a leader in this state for four decades. He didn’t vote for Roy Moore, said it would be bad for the Senate and would be bad for the image of the state of Alabama,” said Jones.

Jones went on to explain he believes if Moore were to be voted into office, it could have a negative impact on the state’s economy.

“I think in order to attract businesses to this state, you’ve got to have a decent image, and that image is one in which you can sit down and talk to people, reason with them, and not talk down to them, one that’s inclusive, and, I think that’s what this campaign has been about,” said Jones at his Monday afternoon campaign event.

Later in the evening, in Birmingham, Jones kept up the momentum, talking about how he wants to create positive progress in Alabama.

“We’ve lagged behind in industry, we’ve lagged behind in education, we’ve lagged behind in healthcare. It is time that we take a road that’s going to get us on the path to progress, that everybody deserves,” Jones said in front a packed house at his Monday night rally at Old Car Heaven in Birmingham.

Also at the rally, actress Uzo Aduba, of Orange is the New Black, and famous basketball player, Charles Barkley, spoke in support of Jones.

“It is abundantly clear that there is only one choice in this election, and that choice is Doug Jones,” Aduba said.

Barkley echoed her support, but with more poignant language.

“At some point, we’ve got to stop looking like idiots to the nation,” said Barkley, “I mean, I love Alabama, but at some point, we’ve got to draw a line in the sand.”

Barkley went on to explain his disdain for Jones’ opponent.

“This guy (Moore) wants to represent us, and he don’t believe in race mixing, that’s crazy,” said Barkley.

Former President Barack Obama also reportedly endorsed Jones, even recording a robocall to go out to voters.

However, when asked about the call Monday afternoon, Jones shied away from recognizing the president’s recording.

“What is your strategy with utilizing that robocall from former President Obama knowing that many Alabama voters here in the state do not support Obama?” FOX10 News Investigative Reporter Kati Weis asked Jones.

Jones responded, “I’m going to be honest with you guys, I’m way up here, and there have been robocalls that have been going out that I’m not sure of. The only robocall that I know of for a fact that was recorded was the one that my wife did, and she told me directly. I’m letting other folks deal with all that. What we’re doing, is we’re trying to come talk to you guys, not flee the state, I didn’t go up to Philadelphia the other day for a football game, I was in Selma, I was in Tuskegee, I was all over the state, trying to talk to people. I think the messages that come from the candidate himself, and the messages from Republican leaders like Richard Shelby, those are the most important.”

In a phone call with FOX10 News, a campaign representative for Jones said the campaign welcomes support from anyone.

TOTTENVILLE, Staten Island — They're two words that evoke images that are not necessarily positive: pit bull and addict.

Now, though, thanks to efforts by one man here with a story of recovery, the two are coming together, with the result being hope, redemption and companionship.

Michael Favor, 34, is the son of a veteran NYPD narcotics detective. Despite that, he ended up becoming a drug addict with an intense habit of abuse.

"I was doing like 15 bags of cocaine a day, along with alcohol," he told PIX11 News outside of his dog training facility.

"My fiancée didn’t know," he said. "I was sleeping when she was away and leaving before she’d wake up."

Two years ago, Favor successfully became clean and sober, and has stayed that way. However, for years before that, his situation demonstrated how addiction affects more than just the addict.

"I felt lied to, and began to hate him," his fiancée, Erica Mahnken, said. "But when I saw what this was becoming, I felt proud and amazed."

Mahnken was talking about the 4,000 square-foot, wooden-enclosed facility that Favor built by hand. He's a carpenter by training, but in his sobriety, he started learning how to train dogs. Mahnken did, as well.

Last spring, a friend donated an empty lot to them, which they developed, along with volunteers, who help them operate the facility also.

"Everybody gets here at an ungodly hour," said George Walsh, who's been a volunteer from the facility's inception. "And I can't tell you how much poop we pick up. And all the dogs get fed, they get loved."

Walsh is not a recovering addict, but many other volunteers are, and are also turning their lives around.

"It worked for me," said Favor, "and I'm willing to open it up to anyone who needs help."

He's also opened up a climate-controlled kennel at his facility. There now, are 14 dogs — 12 of them puppies — who were rescued from hurricane-damaged areas. More dogs, from Puerto Rico, are expected next week.

"I bring them back to life," said Favor, "and they’re all up for adoption, through No More Pain."

No More Pain is the official name of Favor's and Mahnken's charity, which is nicknamed Pit bulls and Addicts. No more pain is also how the couple, the volunteers, the dogs and adopters feel.

They're constantly accepting adoption applications. Anyone wishing to be considered to be the forever home of one of the dogs, or to become a volunteer can get more information here https://www.facebook.com/nomorepainrescue/.2

CBS 2’s Vince Gerasole reports some have their fair share of work to do in Hyde Park.

Tinkering away in a basement workshop, you might be inclined to call him one of Santa’s elves.

“Oh I don’t know about that,” says toy maker Bill Barron. “I’m kind of old and big.”

At 92-years-old, Barron keeps busy making toys. Wooden toys.

When asked about what he thinks about today’s modern toys, Barron isn’t impressed.

“They’re too slick for me really,” says Barron.

The retired engineer now uses his skills to make planes, trains and things with wheels.

And zero batteries. Barron averages one a week.

“They are made to be tossed around in a sand box,” says Barron. “I think it’s important that parents give their kids something they can mess around with.”

Back when Bill was a boy, sock monkeys and Buck Rogers pistols were all the rage.

But nostalgia for a bygone isn’t his motivation.

“Bill and his wife live in a senior high-rise.

For seven years now they’ve presented the toys to staff to share with their families at the holidays.

You can see it brings out the kid in many. And it’s seeing how the people who make his life easier appreciate his gift that keeps him going all year long.

Bill and his wife Dottie did more than take in the joy of the moments today.

Throughout the year, along with other Montgomery Place residents, they raised $82,000 for the staff at holiday time.1
http://www.wday.com/news/4372222-cancer-and-haircut-bring-two-fargo-women-togetherCancer and a haircut bring two Fargo women togetherRachel Hinton's battle against cancer began over a year ago, with what appeared to be a sinus infection. The illness took a drastic turn, with doctors diagnosing her with lymphoma, a form of blood cancer, last October.

The diagnosis came as a shock to Hinton and her husband, who have two children, Simon, 5, and Francis, 2.

"It's been a really difficult journey," Hinton explained.

On Friday, Hinton summoned up the courage to go to the West 13th Salon to buzz off her hair for her chemotherapy treatments. What happened next was something neither Hinton nor her stylist expected.

Lacey Guck, a complete stranger to Hinton, was in the salon getting a routine haircut. While she was getting rinsed, her stylist, MaLeah Wilkerson, shared Hinton's story and why she was getting her head shaved.

In an instant, Guck knew how she wanted to show Hinton support.

"In the moment, it was just clear as day that I was going to be walking out of here with no hair," Guck laughed.

Wilkerson, at first, thought Guck was joking about getting her head shaved. But, after asking again how she would like her hair done, Guck's answer didn't change.

Wilkerson said, "It was an overwhelming feeling of community and togetherness. It broke my heart in the happiest of ways."

Her co-worker, Samantha O'Hara, Hinton's stylist, agreed.

"It just made me love my job more, really," O'Hara said. "My biggest thing with my job that I love, is making people feel beautiful, and these two look beautiful just the way they are."

While many cannot imagine a life without their hair, Guck said she didn't think twice.

"There was no fear, there was no, 'oh no, I'm losing my hair.' It was just, I have hair, now I won't. It's beautiful, it's happy; it's something we're doing together. It's a good day," Guck said.

For Hinton, the act of kindness and support goes beyond words.

"It means so much significance that she would do that," Hinton said. "It was just so simple for her, in that gave me even more faith I think, and courage that there are people out there like her."

If you would like to help spread kindness, the West 13th Salon is accepting any donations to help Hinton and her family with their mounting medical bills.2
http://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/12/11/theft-of-salvation-army-kettles-concerns-officials/Theft Of Salvation Army Kettles Raises Scam ConcernsAURORA, Colo. (CBS4) – The Salvation Army says someone stole two of their red kettles last week, including the accessories that may help the thieves scam donations.

The crime took place in Aurora, and one of the thefts included the red kettle, the sign the apron and the bell.

The Salvation Army is worried that someone may use those items to set up their own kettle collection stand and scam those who donate out of money.

“Last year the Salvation Army helped over 62,000 people in Colorado with toys and gifts. Much of that is made available by the donations that we receive in the Red Kettle. So, when a kettle is stolen, it really robs us of resources to do the good we like to do and it gives people an opportunity to set up shop anywhere they want and solicit donations and really take away from needy people,” said Salvation Army volunteer Will Raihl.

On an average weekday the bell ringers in Aurora collect about $350 to $500.

The Salvation Army says that bell ringers will never ask for money. Anyone who believes a bell ringer may be suspicious should report it.-1

http://cnn.com/2017/12/13/politics/alabama-senate-analysis/index.html5 takeaways from Doug Jones' massive victory in Alabama(CNN) The Alabama Senate race is over. And Democrat Doug Jones has pulled off an absolutely massive upset , edging embattled Republican Roy Moore.

Jones' projected victory narrows the Republican edge in the Senate, which is a very big deal for the future (or lack thereof) of President Donald Trump's policy agenda in 2018.

But, there are broader takeaways -- for Trump, the GOP and the Democratic party -- from Tuesday's result too. Here are 5 big ones.

1. The Senate is now in play in 2018

At the start of this year, the idea that Democrats would have any chance to win the Senate majority come November 2018 was regarded as a joke.

No more.

Jones' victory means that for now Democrats are only 2 seats away from the majority -- Vice President Mike Pence casts the tie-breaking vote when it is 50-50. While a Democratic move into the majority still looks like a long shot, it's now not out of the question.

Remember that Trump won Alabama by 28 points 13 months ago. A Democrat hadn't won a Senate race in the state since 1992 when then Democratic Sen. Richard Shelby won. He switched to the Republican party two years later.

Yes, Moore's profile -- and the series of allegations from women who said he pursued relationships with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s -- made this race uniquely competitive. But, if a Democrat can win in Alabama, a Democrat can win just about anywhere in the country.

The numbers are still daunting for Democrats: 25 Democratic seats are up in 2018 as compared to just 8 for Republicans. But, with competitive races likely for current GOP seats in states like Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee, there is now a path for Democrats to win the majority.

And that is stunning.

2. Donald Trump lost. Again.

JUST WATCHED Trump on Jones win: A hard fought victory Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on Jones win: A hard fought victory 01:02

Trump went all in for Moore in the late stages of this race. His appearance last Friday in Pensacola was a wink, wink, nudge, nudge way to rally Republican support for the flagging Republican nominee. Trump recorded a robocall for Moore, sent out a series of tweets about the race and generally worked in the final week of the campaign to make this a referendum on himself.

It didn't work. Turnout in rural counties in Alabama didn't match the booming numbers in the Democratic enclaves of the state. (More on that later.) In a state where Trump won massively just more than a year ago, his approval rating was a so-so 48% approve and 48% disapprove, according to exit polls.

There's no doubt that Trump's involvement on Moore's behalf -- against the wishes of a large chunk of the Senate Republicans -- was largely driven by a belief that the two men were kindred spirits. Both, in Trump's mind, faced unfair sexual allegations. Both made a career out of fighting the GOP establishment. Both were warriors against political correctness.

But, Roy Moore, the Donald Trump of Alabama, lost on Tuesday night. And that means Donald Trump lost too.

What it doesn't mean is that Trump will moderate his behavior in any meaningful way. Usually, when faced with a loss, Trump doubles down and insists that somehow, someway he won. This is not a man who will admit defeat even when it's staring him in the face as it is in Alabama.

3. Mitch McConnell breathes a sigh of relief. For now.

JUST WATCHED McConnell on Roy Moore recently: Let the voters decide Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McConnell on Roy Moore recently: Let the voters decide 01:07

Make no mistake: Mitch McConnell did not want Roy Moore in the Senate. McConnell -- and the rest of the GOP leadership -- did everything they could to get rid of Moore. When it became clear Moore wasn't going to leave the race -- and Trump started to weigh in for the embattled GOP nominee -- McConnell threw his hands up and said it was up to the voters of Alabama to decide the race.

McConnell's unwillingness on Tuesday to even engage the prospect of what he would do if Moore won spoke to just how little the majority leader wanted Moore in the Senate.

There's no question that McConnell took a big sigh of relief when Jones was declared the winner just before 10:30 p.m. ET. In his mind, the Moore loss is short-term pain (the GOP margin shrinks to a single seat) for the long term gain (the GOP brand doesn't have to be associated with an accused child molester for the next few years.)

At issue for McConnell is that the forces at work in the Alabama race suggest that his plans to expand the GOP Senate majority in 2018 may be in trouble. If the Democratic base is anywhere near as fired up in the 2018 midterm as they were in Alabama on Tuesday, the GOP Senate map starts to look a lot less friendly.

And that's even before you consider the likely McConnell versus Steve Bannon primary fights to come in states like Arizona and Nevada.

4. The Democratic base is fired up and ready to go

For Jones to even have a chance to win, the core pillars of the Democratic base in Alabama -- especially African American voters -- had to turn out in presidential election-like numbers. No one thought that was possible -- until it happened.

Black voters comprised 29% of the Alabama electorate on Tuesday and went for Jones by 92 points, according to exit polling. In 2012, African Americans made up 28% of voters and Barack Obama won them by 91 points.

That's stunning. Jones matched the performance of the first black president in history among black voters.

There were, of course, extenuating circumstances. Moore was long seen as the Alabama Democratic base as enemy #1 -- due not only to his controversial statements on race, gender and homosexuality, but also because of his long record in the state as a lightning rod for conservative causes. Not every state, in short, has a Roy Moore.

But, this race became about more than Moore by the end of it. Due to Trump's involvement in the final days, it became a way for Democratic partisans to send a massive message -- and warning -- to the President. That message? If we can beat you here, we can beat you anywhere.

And, they delivered it. If you are a Republican running for office in any corner of the country, the results in Alabama should scare you. If they don't, you aren't paying attention.

5. Candidates and campaigns matter

Moore is, was and always will be a deeply flawed candidate. Even before the allegations of sexual impropriety arose, Moore had a history of underperforming other Republican office holders on the ballot.

Yes, he had his core base of 35% or so who would never leave him no matter what he said or what people said about him. And, in a Republican primary, that was enough. But Moore showed zero inclination or ability to ever expand beyond that hardcore base. His candidacy felt more geared toward the 1950s than 2017.

Meanwhile, Jones avoided being labeled a national Democrat and did everything he could to make the race about values -- and who better shared the values of the average Alabama voter. He didn't spend tons of time talking about abortion or guns. He talked about the economy and about how Moore let his own personal ideology get in the way of doing what was right for the state.

The lesson: Even in a state as red as Alabama, you can't nominate a massively flawed candidate and just expect the partisanship of the electorate to deliver a win for you. Particularly when the other side nominated a credible alternative.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/13/politics/donald-trump-senate-race/index.htmlTrump tries to minimize stinging defeat(CNN) President Donald Trump woke to a self-inflicted political disaster Wednesday morning that even he could not chalk up to fake news, after Republican Roy Moore crashed to defeat in the Alabama Senate race.

Completely disregarding the advice of top Republicans, Trump had thrown himself unequivocally and comprehensively behind Moore -- and so the deeply flawed Republican candidate's upset loss on Tuesday is now his own.

Trump had argued that notwithstanding allegations of sexual abuse whirling around Moore, Republicans should vote for him anyway because he would be better than a Democrat who would be weak on crime, the military and borders.

But in an effort to save face on Wednesday, he insisted he had actually had it right all along -- recalling his earlier support for incumbent Sen. Luther Strange in a primary, before he was defeated by Moore, in what was seen at the time as another bad political bet by the President.

"The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!" Trump tweeted

But the stunning win by Democrat Doug Jones in one of the nation's most conservative states raised questions not just about Trump's political acumen but also over whether his remarkable run, in which he crushed convention and defied political gravity, is beginning, finally, to run out of steam.

Moore's loss also put the fate of the President's agenda on the line, with the GOP majority in the Senate now shaved to just a single vote and the chamber one step closer, though still a long shot, to being up for grabs in midterm elections next year.

In his first reaction to the loss, Trump was unusually chivalrous, congratulating Jones and bemoaning the write-in votes that helped doom Moore.

"The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!" Trump tweeted.

Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2017

Whether the President's mood remains as upbeat once he has had time to brood on his humiliation is not clear. It is still more uncertain whether he will interpret Tuesday's loss as a cue to moderate his behavior, which may have dampened Republican turnout. He spent Tuesday escalating a confrontation with Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in which he was accused of making a tasteless sexual reference.

Signs of hope for the Democrats

There was jubilation for Democrats, who embraced an unlikely hero in a state they never thought they could win. There is a sense, building on Democratic victories in Alabama and last month in Virginia, that the mood in the country is beginning to turn the party's way.

"We have been at crossroads in the past. And unfortunately we have usually taken the wrong fork," Jones said in his victory speech, referring to the history of a state torn by racial and cultural divides.

"Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, you took the right road."

Thirteen months after one of their darkest hours turned into a yearlong funk after Hillary Clinton's defeat, party activists now have reason to believe again and will enter the new year with real hopes of making noise in 2018.

The result suggested that in the right circumstances with an engaged base vote, especially with African-Americans showing up in larger-than-expected numbers, Democrats could punch a hole in the Trump coalition of rural, working-class voters attracted by the President's populist nationalism and evangelicals sticking with him largely over issues like Supreme Court nominations.

Tuesday night will also send a chill through Republican ranks as lawmakers consider whether the race was an outlier or, along with last month's Virginia elections, could signal a building anti-Trump backlash that could sweep them away next fall.

A public reckoning

The Alabama special election also came at an extraordinary moment in American political life -- with allegations against Moore coinciding with an awakening over sexual harassment against women in politics, the media and entertainment.

The question must now be whether the force of that movement begins to reshape politics itself ahead of the midterms next year and Trump's re-election race in 2020, and whether the allegations of sexual misconduct against the President himself now begin to become a greater political liability.

One of Trump's biggest critics, GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, who has criticized the President's moral leadership, summed up the result in a simple tweet: "Decency wins."

Decency wins — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 13, 2017

By siding so closely with Moore, Trump has given Democrats an opening to argue that he supported an accused child molester for his own political gain.

A source close to the White House told CNN's Jim Acosta the the result was "devastating for the President" and an "earthquake."

The source also suggested that the President had been led into a poor political spot by his former top chief strategist Steve Bannon, who had embraced Moore as an archetype of the anti-establishment army he wants to take over the GOP.

"The President has egg on his face" because of Bannon, the source said.

While every top Republican rejected Moore, showing revulsion about the charges of sexual abuse against him, Trump insisted that there was no alternative to sending Moore to the narrowly divided Senate, to save his own agenda.

But in the end, the President could not pull a badly flawed candidate across the line, in one of the most conservative, pro-Trump states in the country, that has often appeared to have a special place in the President's heart.

Trump supporters will now argue that Moore was a disastrous candidate, that his loss should be seen in isolation and that it has no reflection on the President's reputation or political fortunes in the months to come.

"Donald Trump tried to rescue a campaign that was doomed," said former GOP Sen. Rick Santorum, who is now a CNN commentator.

In the aftermath of that defeat, political observers will watch to see whether the President will be more willing to take advice of establishment leaders trying to cling to their Republican majorities next year or whether he will still be tempted to unleash the dogs of internal GOP civil war.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may be reviled by Trump's supporters, but Tuesday's loss vindicated comments he made by the President's side in the White House Rose Garden barely two months ago.

"My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority. The way you do that is not complicated," McConnell said at the time. "You have to have nominate people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home."

Republicans, seeking to repeal and replace Obamacare and pass a massive tax reform bill, already have experienced the fickle nature of Senate math as McConnell has struggled to piece together a working majority.

But there were also sighs of relief for Republicans on Tuesday.

Had Moore won, the civil war raging in the party would have invaded the Senate itself, with McConnell expected to open an ethics investigation into Moore.

If the allegations against him were found to have merit, senators would likely have been forced to eject him from the Senate while incurring the wrath of supporters of the President, who strongly backed the Alabama judge.

Now they will be spared that tough vote.

Trump has proven again and again that he is a resilient political figure with an unusually loyal political base. And if the economy is still booming next November and the stock market is still humming, Democrats may find things a lot tougher than they were in Alabama and Virginia.

But the implications of the Republican debacle in Alabama will rumble on for months to come.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/tillerson-north-korea-no-preconditions-talks/index.htmlTillerson: US won't set preconditions for North Korea talksWashington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US is ready to talk with North Korea without preconditions, in comments that appeared to signal a shift in State Department policy.

"We've said from the diplomatic side, we're ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk," Tillerson said at the Atlantic Council in Washington on Tuesday, in what amounted to a direct public invitation for North Korea to put aside an escalating cycle of tests and taunts and engage in diplomacy.

"We are ready to have the first meeting without precondition," Tillerson said. "Let's just meet, and we can talk about the weather if you want. Talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table, if that's what you are excited about. But can we at least sit down and see each other face to face, and then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map of what we might be willing to work towards."

The remarks are some of the most concrete issued by Tillerson on what talks with North Korea might look like, though it remains unclear as to whether they reflect the views of the White House. Tillerson has routinely appeared at odds with US President Donald Trump over potential talks with Pyongyang. Earlier this year , Trump tweeted that Tillerson was "wasting his time" negotiating with North Korea.

When asked about Tillerson's Tuesday comments, the White House said "the President's views on North Korea have not changed."

"North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China and South Korea, but the entire world. North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea," Sarah Sanders, the President's press secretary, said in an email.

But Tillerson's comments met with approval in at least one part of the world, Russia.

"We can say that such constructive statements are much more appealing than the confrontational rhetoric which we have heard so far," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday.

Speaking during a conference call Peskov said Tillerson's stance is "welcomed, and most importantly, is in line with appeals from Russia. As President [Vladimir] Putin has repeatedly said, confrontational rhetoric and any steps that can provoke further tension on the Korean peninsula are absolutely counterproductive. It was Putin who traditionally and consistently urged all interested parties to do everything possible to build channels for dialogue, therefore, such statements satisfy us."

Tillerson had previously said that the United States was willing to negotiate, but has been vague about what would need to happen before both sides sat down together and whether talks would be subject to certain preconditions.

Kingston Reif, the director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, told CNN that Tillerson's comments were the most detailed to date on the potential parameters for talks.

"He made clear that initial meeting(s) can begin without preconditions and without North Korea committing to denuclearization. He also said that talks would be difficult to sustain in absence of North Korea's testing freeze," Reif said.

Pyongyang has dramatically increased the pace of its missile program in 2017. In September, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the country's largest and most powerful nuclear test yet. Since February, Pyongyang has fired off 23 missiles, improving its technology with each launch.

The most recent test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on November 29 came after a break in testing of almost two months and a week after the Trump administration slapped new sanctions on the regime. It flew higher and farther than any previous test, and demonstrated that North Korea had the ability to hit "everywhere in the world," Mattis said at the time.

JUST WATCHED Nikki Haley: North Korea sanctions 'helping us tremendously' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nikki Haley: North Korea sanctions 'helping us tremendously' 01:34

Trump's take

Trump has ratcheted up the rhetoric about North Korea since assuming office, mocking its leader Kim Jong Un as " Little Rocket Man ," threatening to "totally destroy" the country and rain down "fire and fury" if it threatens the US.

"Key questions remain," Reif said of Tillerson's latest comments. "Does Tillerson speak for the administration? And what would we be willing to put on the table in return for sustaining a testing freeze and more comprehensive talks?"

US National Security Adviser HR McMaster, one of Trump's most trusted foreign policy aides, said Tuesday that the global community must "make the most out of what might be our last best chance" to avoid military action, echoing comments he previously made that "time is running out."

Those comments may be more indicative of the administration's actual policy on North Korea, as Tillerson is believed to have been marginalized in the policy-making process. Reports surfaced last month that the Trump administration was considering replacing Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, though the White House pushed back when asked about the rumors.

"You need both sides to be credible in the good cop-bad cop routine for it to work. There are too many doubts about the weight and credibility of Tillerson." said Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT and a member of MIT's Security Studies Program. "McMaster has the ear of the President and is much more credible."

Demands

Tillerson said it wasn't workable to demand that North Korea give up its weapons before talks begin, and that US President Donald Trump agrees. The administration has said that serious negotiations with North Korea will have to focus on denuclearization.

"It's not realistic to say we are only going to talk if you come to the table ready to give up your program," Tillerson said. "They have too much invested in it, and the President is very realistic about that as well."

The top US diplomat laid out one caveat: North Korea would have to ensure a period of quiet during talks.

"So I clearly think they understand that if we are going to talk, we have to have period of quiet ... or it's going to be very difficult to have productive discussions. And so we continue to indicate to them, we need a period of quiet. You need to tell us you want to talk, the door is open. But we'll show up when you tell us you're ready to talk," he said.

JUST WATCHED Experts: NK missile could hit anywhere in US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Experts: NK missile could hit anywhere in US 02:21

Responding to Tillerson's comments Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang welcomed all efforts that would ease tensions, and reiterated China's willingness to "play a constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the issue through dialogues."

"China has raised its 'dual-track thought' and 'suspension for suspension' proposal. We hope to see the United States and North Korea move in the same direction, and make meaningful steps towards dialogues and contact," said Lu.

Though some North Korea analysts agree that mandating that North Korea give up its nuclear weapons up-front is a doomed strategy, others worry that Pyongyang's history of violating international agreements makes negotiation without the preconditions too risky.

"The Trump administration should insist that North Korea commit to denuclearization upfront to avoid the failed negotiations of the past and any testing freeze is accompanied by verification that the programs do not continue during the negotiations," Anthony Ruggiero, a former US State Department and Treasury Department official, said in a tweet.

The comments come after a top UN diplomat, Jeffrey Feltman, visited Pyongyang last week. He spoke with top North Korean diplomats about the increasingly dangerous security situation.

"In my professional career this was certainly the most important mission I've ever undertaken," Feltman, a former State Department veteran, said Tuesday.

When asked about Tillerson's comments on preconditions, Feltman said he told his North Korean hosts that "we really believe that they need to signal that they're willing now to go in a different direction, to start some kind of engagement, to start talking about talks. And I think they listened seriously to our arguments."

"But they did not offer any time of commitment to us at that point. I think that they have to reflect on what we said with their own leadership and I don't want to try to suggest that I can read the minds of my interlocutors or put words in their mouth," Feltman said.

'Ready to talk anytime'

Tillerson coupled the public invitation to Pyongyang with an update on the international pressure campaign he has helped build that has squeezed North Korean revenues from coal, textiles and forced labor, winnowed down its oil imports, and left it increasingly isolated on the diplomatic stage as countries across the globe expel its diplomats.

Speaking earlier in the day at the State Department, Tillerson told employees there that the US will maintain the diplomatic campaign "and continue to turn that pressure up until we can get an engagement in a meaningful way with North Korea."

"We need to have DPRK come to the table," Tillerson added at the Atlantic Council. "We're ready to talk anytime they're ready to talk, but they have to come to the table and they have to come to the table with a view that they're ready to make a different choice."

In the remarks at the State Department , Tillerson had acknowledged that there is a limit to what the US and its international partners can do with the pressure campaign. "We can only do our part of this," he said. "And the regime is going to have to come to some decision about their future ... We want them to make the right choice."

Tillerson said that he has told Mattis that if diplomacy doesn't work, he will have "failed." He added that diplomatic efforts are backed by military options and that if North Korea makes "bad choices," the US is ready.

"We have a strong military presence standing behind us," Tillerson said of his diplomatic efforts. "If North Korea makes bad choices, we're prepared."

At the Atlantic Council, Tillerson said the question was about how to "begin the process of engagement, because we are dealing with a new leader in North Korea who no one has ever engaged with."

"The important thing is that we get started," he added.

"The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!" Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning.

In the days following the primary in September, multiple tweets in support of Strange were deleted from Trump's Twitter account after his loss.

While the election results came in Tuesday night, Trump tweeted a somewhat conciliatory message, congratulating Democrat Doug Jones on winning "a hard fought victory."

Jones edged out Republican Roy Moore in a race that remained neck-and-neck for the majority of election night.

Jones' win comes after a contentious fight to fill now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' former seat, with Moore facing several sexual allegations from years ago.

Multiple women accused Moore of pursuing relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, and some of them accused him of sexual assault or abuse.

http://cnn.com/travel/article/buckingham-palace-tour/index.html15 highlights from the Buckingham Palace tour(CNN) — Historic residences don't get much more regal than Buckingham Palace in London

Originally owned by the Duke of Buckingham, Buckingham House (as it was known then) was bought by King George III for his wife Queen Charlotte in 1761.

He eventually transformed the one-time townhouse into a palace and Queen Victoria became the first sovereign to live there in July 1837.

The landmark has been the London residence of Queen Elizabeth II since her accession to the throne and opened its doors to the public nearly 25 years ago.

Interest in the Queen has grown in recent years, partly because of the success of television shows such as "The Crown," which focuses on the early years of Britain's monarch, and events such as the impending wedding of Price Harry and Meghan Markle.

Marvel at the royal grandeur of the halls that have been home to British kings and queens for 180 years.

The second season of the royal drama starring Claire Foy and Matt Smith will be released on streaming service Netflix in December 2017.

Although the majority of Buckingham Palace's 775 rooms remain out of bounds, the organized tours, which usually run from late July to late September, allow visitors access to all 19 State Rooms, the Palace Gardens and the Royal Mews.

From the grand staircase, to the artwork, sculptures and state coaches, the Buckingham Palace tour is packed with remarkable sights. Here's our pick of the top 15 highlights:

1. The staircase

The spectacular grand staircase is one of the first things you'll see during the tour -- and it's also one of the best. Designed by architect John Nash as part of his commission to renovate the palace for King George IV back in the early 1800s, it features a gilt-bronze balustrade decorated with intricate designs of acanthus, oak and laurel leaves.

The stairs, which lead up to the State Rooms, are lit up by a beautiful dome in the ceiling and the walls on the upper landing are adorned with portraits of the Queen's ancestors.

2. The audio tour

No one knows the palace better than the royals themselves, so who better to introduce the audio guide than Prince Charles, who was actually born there?

All visitors receive the free audio guide, available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Russian and Mandarin.

There's also a family audio guide (available in English only) with an activity trail suitable for children between seven and 11 years old.

3. The chandeliers

The high ceilings at Buckingham Palace feature some of the most dramatic chandeliers you'll ever gaze up at.

There's the waterfall chandelier, which hangs from the center of the White Drawing Room, the nine-light gilt-bronze and glass chandeliers in the Throne Room, the dazzling six crystal chandeliers suspended from the ceiling of the Ballroom and the set of four glass and ormolu chandeliers in the Blue Drawing Room.

They can all be lowered with a remote control for cleaning purposes, but maintaining them comes with a hefty price tag. Palace officials spent almost £100,000 on chandelier cleaning from 2004 to 2005.

4. "Mars and Venus"

Commissioned by George IV to mark the fall of Napoleon, "Mars and Venus" by celebrated sculptor Antonio Canova is a sight to behold. The sculpture, located in the Marble Hall, depicts the Roman god of war and the Roman goddess of love in a romantic clinch and was carved from a single block of marble.

5. The Throne Room

While you won't get to sit on them yourself, being in the presence of the thrones at the palace is something of an experience. Raised on a platform in the Throne Room, the red and gold chairs ooze grandiosity and have the initials of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip sewn into their fabric.

While the Throne Room was used as a ballroom when Queen Victoria was monarch, it's largely used as a backdrop for royal wedding photographs nowadays.

6. The Picture Gallery

Originally created to display King George VI's magnificent art collection, the Picture Gallery boasts some of the most beautiful paintings from the royal portfolio.

While the display changes regularly as the Queen often loans out the artwork, highlights include self-portraits by Rembrandt and Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck's "The Virgin and Child" and various works by Venetian painter Canaletto.

7. Queen Victoria's gold piano

The White Drawing Room is one of the most opulent state rooms at the palace, and its standout piece is a stunning grand piano made for Queen Victoria.

Built by the company S & P Erard in 1856, it was gilded by François Rochard and decorated with elaborate oil-painted scenes of cherubs and singeries -- humorous vignettes of monkeys playing musical instruments and causing trouble.

The piano was regularly used by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, both accomplished pianists who enjoyed playing together.

8. The Sevres porcelain collection

Buckingham Palace holds an outstanding collection of Sèvres porcelain made by Manufacture Nationale de Sèvres, considered the finest porcelain producer in Europe from the mid-18th century.

The majority of the pieces were obtained by King George IV, who was an enthusiastic collector of Sèvres, between 1783 and 1830.

Some of the most striking include a potpourri vase in the form of a ship that originally belonged to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of Louis XV, which can be seen in the Green Drawing Room, as well as the "Table of the Great Commanders of Antiquity", made for Napoleon but subsequently gifted to George IV by Louis XVIII. This piece is located in the Blue Drawing Room.

9. The exhibitions

Buckingham Palace puts on a different exhibition every summer as part of the public opening. Last year's was named "Royal Gifts" and displayed a variety of presents given to the Queen by the likes of former US president John F. Kennedy and former South African President Nelson Mandela.

The 2018 opening will include an exhibition that marks the 70th birthday of Prince Charles.

10. The Ballroom

At 37 meters long and 18 meters wide, the Ballroom is the largest and most ostentatious room at the palace. Inspired by Italian Renaissance design, it first opened in 1856 to mark the end of the Crimean War and is now used for investitures and state banquets, where the Queen hosts heads of state and about 170 guests.

11. The secret door

Can you spot the secret door in the White Drawing Room? Nick Ansell - WPA Pool/Getty Images

One of the most intriguing sights in the White Drawing Room is almost completely hidden from view. It's connected to the Queen's private rooms via a secret door, which she uses to enter the State Rooms when meeting guests.

Eagle-eyed visitors may just be able to make out the door, which is concealed behind what looks like a cabinet.

12. The Music Room

The Music Room is one of the last destinations on the tour. It's sometimes used as a venue for recitals and features a grand piano by John Broadwood & Sons.

The grand furniture on display originally belonged to George IV and was supplied to him by Parisian chair and bedmaker Georges Jacob in the late 18th century. Numerous royals have been christened in the Music Room including Prince Charles and Prince William.

13. The Palace Gardens

The Palace gardens house 30 species of bird, 150 mature trees and 322 types of British wild flower. Visitors keen to explore the grounds have the option to take a combined tour of the State Rooms and the Palace Gardens at an extra cost.

The tour kicks off with a talk inside the Palace, followed by a guided walk around the 39-acre garden, where you'll see a three-acre lake, a 156-meter herbaceous border, the wisteria-covered Summer House, a rose garden and a 15-foot waterloo vase, which is one of Britain's biggest garden ornaments.

The tennis court, where King George VI once played Wimbledon champion Fred Perry in the 1930s, is also on the itinerary.

14. The Gold State Coach

Royal Day Out ticket to Buckingham Palace includes a free 45-minute guided tour of the Royal Mews (as well as entry to the State Rooms and the Queen's Gallery), which is one of the finest working stables in the world.

Here visitors are treated to the impressive sight of various historic coaches and carriages, some of which are still used by the monarchs. The stand out is the Gold State Coach, which was built for George III in 1762 and weighs almost four tonnes. It's been used for every coronation since 1821 and needs eight horses to pull it because of its heaviness.

Many of the Queen's horses, including the famous Windsor Greys that drew the private carriages of the royal family during Queen Victoria's reign, are kept at the Mews.

15. Changing of the guard

The Changing of the Guard, a formal ceremony in which the New Guard exchanges duties with the Old Guard, takes place outside the palace between 11:00 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. every day during April until the end of July (it takes place on alternate days throughout the rest of the year). The ceremony is conducted on the Palace forecourt , so if you time your Buckingham Palace tour well enough, you'll be able to catch it.

Buckingham Palace will be open to the public from Saturday, 21 July 2018 to Sunday, 30 September 2018. The State Rooms Tour is available for about $32 for adults and $18 for under 17s . The State Rooms and Garden Highlights Tour costs about $43 for adults and $26 for under 17s. A Royal Day Out ticket (adults about $52, under 17s $29) gives access to the State Rooms, the Queen's Gallery and the Royal Mews. Children under five years old are free of charge. Exclusive guided tours are often available during December, January, Easter and September.0

http://cnn.com/travel/article/perth-things-to-do/index.htmlBest things to do in Perth, Australia's capital of cool(CNN) — It was the unlikely setting of a dark basement rock bar named Alfred's Pizzeria that confirmed our suspicions about Perth.

Under a tongue-in-cheek sign proclaiming "No Stairway to Heaven," brilliant cocktails, the perfect playlist and impeccable handmade pizzas came together in one of the coolest bars in what's definitely one of the coolest cities in the Southern Hemisphere.

Even if, this being Australia , they'd never admit as much.

The capital of the vast state of Western Australia may be a long way from most destinations , but Perth's remote location makes its appeal even stronger.

There's the feeling that Perthites have long known that their city was a hidden travel gem, but it's come into its own more than ever in the past couple of years.

That's set to increase still further in March next year as Qantas makes it the hub for their long-range nonstop Dreamliner flights from Europe, meaning thousands more visitors will arrive each month.

Here are nine ways to enjoy Perth, which has earned itself a place with the more well-known state capitals of Melbourne and Sydney as must-visit cities when in Australia.

Bar and nightlife scene

Perth's bar and nightlife scene has exploded in recent years, with scores of independent watering holes springing up around the city.

One man who has visited most of them is Canadian Ryan Mossny, Perth resident and co-founder of Two Feet and a Heartbeat , a popular walking tour highlighting some of the city's best bars.

"Everyone talks about our amazing weather, blue skies and perfect beaches," says Mossny.

"I love that we have a thriving art, culture and festival scene, but most importantly the incredible bars and restaurants that feature local produce."

There are upwards of 30 small bars in the heart of the city center including Helvetica , which specializes in whisky cocktails and carries more than 400 varieties of the brown stuff.

Bar Sequel pays homage to movie sequels while Fromage Artisans offers an optional cheese-tasting experience with their array of fine wines and drinks, served up in a former bank vault.

The manager of the subterranean rock bar Alfred's Pizzeria , Gillian Kady explains: "Everybody works very well together and there's a lot of skill and talent in this town. Perth is now on par with Melbourne and staff are coming back from the east coast with their knowledge. They also try to use seasonal and native herbs and vegetables, while there are great local whiskies and gins too."

Wolf Lane

Another discovery on the walking tour is Wolf Lane, home to sensational street art by global artists invited to Perth by City Council. Highlights include Argentinian artist Pastel's works inspired by intricate, indigenous Australian art and the characters of Stormie Mills, a local artist.

Wolf Lane itself is a pedestrian lane revitalized as part of a project to make the most of the city's urban spaces. It sits between two shopping streets and features cafes and bars, but it's the mix of huge murals and smaller artworks that catch the eye.

One notable work comes from Peter Drew, an Australian artist whose poster-sized images of real Australians from over the years come with the word "Aussie" prominently stamped in capital letters.

All the images stimulate discussion around the idea of national identity. Those immortalized include Monga Khan, a 19th-century turban-wearing Indian who brought camels to Australia.

Rottnest Island

Rottnest Island is a stunning city getaway. Chris Dwyer/CNN

It may not have the most enticing name, but Rottnest Island is an iconic spot for Perthites. It was originally named "Rotte Nest," or "rat's nest," by a 17th-century Dutch explorer who mistook the island's quokkas for giant rats.

What's a quokka? The beloved creatures are ridiculously cute, herbivorous marsupials about the size of a domestic cat.

They've made the island even more of a draw as they show little fear of humans and are seemingly happy to "pose" for selfies with visitors, even if authorities are keen to point out that both touching and feeding them are illegal.

But Rottnest -- or Rotto as it's known locally -- has much more to offer.

White sand beaches and aquamarine water feature in secluded coves, where snorkeling brings visitors up close with dazzling marine life.

Bike trails crisscross the island, while Wadjemup Bidi has 45 kilometers of paths highlighting cultural and environmental landmarks.

History also abounds in the island's museum, which chronicles the island's former role as a harsh prison colony, almost wholly for the local indigenous Australian Nyungar people.

Humpback whale hotspot

Rottnest Island sits 17 kilometers offshore and the channel between it and the mainland is home to an annual humpback whale migration that visitors can experience between September and early December.

The gentle giants pass down the coast of Western Australia, through Perth's coastal waters, to feeding grounds near Antarctica.

They then form groups and migrate north to warmer winter breeding grounds nearer the equator.

If visitors on the whale-watching boat tours are lucky, they may catch a breach when the humpbacks throw themselves out of the water before crashing back down.

For added insights, scientists from Perth Aquarium join the tours.

King's Park

Every city has a park of some description, so what's so special about King's Park, overlooking Perth? Much, as it turns out.

For starters it's one of the world's largest inner-city parks, 400 hectares in size, two-thirds of which is protected bushland that celebrates the region's unique native biodiversity.

The Western Australian Botanic Garden holds more than 3,000 species of the state's diverse and spectacular flora, while a giant 750-year-old boab tree is rightly an icon.

In 2008, it was bought to the park from Warmun in the state's Kimberley region, almost 2,000 miles away, a reminder of the incredible size of Western Australia.

King's Park is also rich with Nyungar and European history, something it shares through public education programs, walking trails, children's play areas and more.

Visitors can also walk through the treetops, take in the graceful State War Memorial or just kick back and relax with views overlooking the city and Swan River below.

Food

The selection and quality of Perth's food offerings has to be seen to be believed, with delicious options at every price point.

The annual Night Noodle Markets have proved a huge success, with 20 stalls featuring great-value dishes from Asian destinations including the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, China and more, reflecting the city's cultural diversity.

Eat Drink Perth is another annual event showcasing the best of the city's exploding food and beverage scene.

Eating options include contemporary fine dining at Wild Swan, matched with their own wines or beers from the on-site Homestead Brewery.

Their hugely popular beer garden, The Llawn, is casual and family-friendly, attracting hundreds of guests who kick back on tables by the river to enjoy spit roast, charcuterie, platters and pizzas.

A new accommodation block is set to offer 32 rooms to guests who want to make the most of their time, perhaps indulging in a wider tasting of their wines including Verdelho, Chenin Blanc, Semillon and Frontignac.

For a fee (not generally small), you can avoid the usual frenzy and bag fresh tracks with barely a soul around.

If your pockets are deep and you've chosen well, you can retire to your own luxury slopeside lodge and do it all over again the next day.

Here are nine of the best private ski resorts and semi-private ski destinations in the USA and beyond:

Yellowstone Club, Montana, USA



Who for: M. Moneybags esq., celeb spotters, Bill Gates

This is skiing the uber-rich way. Becoming a member at the Yellowstone Club in the Rockies of Montana means potentially riding the lifts with just Bill Gates or Justin Timberlake for company.

The limited-membership club charges an initial fee of $300,000 and an annual fee of $37,500, but that's just the small change.

To become a member you have to own property, which ranges from condos starting at $3 million to ranches north of $25 million.

But once you've splashed the cash, the skiing's epic, with 16 lifts, 60 runs and 2,700 vertical feet of downhill action centered on Pioneer Mountain. Plus, there's 300 inches annually of the white stuff.

There's everything in the 2,200 skiable acres from gentle beginner slopes to steep expert chutes. If that's not enough, Yellowstone Club backs onto the vast Big Sky resort. All that, and you can bag some runs with extreme ski legend Scot Schmidt , who is the club's resident ski pro.

Getting there: Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport is only an hour's drive from Yellowstone Club with daily flights from across the United States. Transfers to and from the airport can be arranged by car or helicopter

The Hermitage Club, Vermont, USA



Who for: East coast money, Wall Street weekend warriors

The Hermitage Club at Haystack Mountain is a private club in the Green Mountains of Southern Vermont.

The 194-acre ski area features five chairlifts and 46 tree-lined trails on the side of Haystack Mountain with 1,400 feet of vertical drop.

There is a member cap of 1,500 (which hasn't been reached yet), with no more than 1,000 skiers on the mountain at a time.

The damage? A cool $85,000 up front with $9,500 annually in dues.

Lodging is in one of six local inns, slopeside townhouses or condos with further development planned.

Getting there: It's a four-hour drive from New York or a 45-minute helicopter flight from Wall Street.

The Cimarron Mountain Club is set to offer ultra-exclusive skiing when it opens in December 2018. Cimarron Club

Cimarron Mountain Club, Colorado, USA



Who for: Those who REALLY hate lift lines

The Cimarron Mountain Club could just be the most exclusive resort-based ski experience in the world when it opens in December 2018.

The 1,750-acre property in the San Juan Mountains between Telluride and Crested Butte will be available to just 15 home-owning families and their guests.

The initial buy-in is likely to be about $3.4 million, with annual dues between $55,000 and $65,000.

Members are then deeded a site on which to build a cabin, although they may prefer to stay in the six-bedroom lodge or one of four club cabins.

The ski area encompasses 1,000 acres along the club's two-and-a-half miles of the Cimmaron Ridge, with access to another 950 acres of public land. The 60 runs will be reached by snowcat, with six distinct areas offering a variety of terrain from leisurely groomed runs to glades, chutes and bowls.

Each member is guaranteed 115 days of cat-skiing a year on an area the club claims is bigger than Aspen Mountain. And with a limit in the current accommodation of just 36 guests, that's a lot of skiable acreage per person.

Getting there: The Cimarron Club is 45 minutes by car or 10 minutes by helicopter from Montrose airport, which offers private jet services and seasonal non-stop flights from a range of national hubs.

Eagle Point, Utah, USA



Who for: Powder hounds in search of solitude

Eagle Point, halfway between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas in southern Utah, is a public ski resort with an exclusive twist.

With a lofty base at 9,100 feet it receives more than 350 inches of Utah's legendary dry powder a year, which can be exclusively yours for three days a week.

For the pocket change of $10,000 a day, the entire mountain -- five lifts, 40-plus pine-clad runs, 600 skiable acres, 1,500 feet of vertical -- can be rented Tuesday-Thursday, January through the end of March, for individuals or groups of up to 200 on corporate junkets.

Accommodation is mostly in condos although there are larger homes with hot tubs and all the luxury trim.

Getting there: Las Vegas is a three-hour drive southwest of Eagle Point, Salt Lake City is about the same to the north. Small private jets can fly into Beaver Municipal airport, which is 22 miles away.

Silverton Mountain, near Telluride in Colorado, enjoys 400 inches of snow per year for limited numbers to enjoy. Silverton

Silverton Mountain, Colorado, USA



Who for: Backcountry fans who like to hike

Silverton has one single chairlift, but this highway to heaven accesses 1,819 acres of exclusive excitement.

This ungroomed ski area, for advanced and experts only, lies a short distance as the crow flies from Telluride and enjoys the same whopping 400 inches of snow per year.

The genius is in the policy of guided groups only from December to March (Thursday-Sunday), which limits the number of visitors.

If that's still not exclusive enough, you can book the whole mountain, from $14,900 per day.

The ski area rises from 10,400 feet to 12,300 feet, and the mustard keen can hike beyond that to a peak of 13,487 feet for some of the highest skiing in North America.

There are a variety of lodging options in the nearby town of Silverton, an off-the-beaten-track former silver mining camp.

Getting there: Silverton is a one-hour drive from either Durango or Montrose airports and six hours south of Denver through spectacular scenery.

Powder Mountan is an upside-down ski area in the San Juan Mountains of Utah. Powder Mountain

Powder Mountain, Utah, USA



Who for: Early birds and entrepreneurs

"Pow Mow," as it's known to locals, is something of a powdery garden of Eden. That's Eden, Utah, an hour north of Salt Lake City in the Wasatch mountains.

It's not exactly private -- in fact, it's very much public -- but lift tickets are limited to 1,500 per day to preserve its soul.

Powder Mountain was taken over in 2013 by the Summit collective of new-age entrepreneurs and thought leaders, with funds boosted by crowdsourcing big names such as Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Alphabet, Inc.'s Eric Schmidt.

The vision is to build a controlled and sympathetic next-generation alpine town at 8,600 feet at the top of this upside-down ski area, appealing to artists, innovators and influencers.

Nine lifts currently access the 167 runs to provide a lift-served skiable area of 7,957 acres, which the resort claims is the largest area per skier in the US.

The highest lift goes to Hidden Lake Lodge at 8,900 feet, but there are also expansive avalanche-controlled snowcat skiing areas, for $25 a drop, which funnel back to shuttle bus stops or lifts.

Getting there: Powder Mountain is 55 miles from Salt Lake City and 20 minutes from the former frontier town of Ogden, and the Ogden-Hinckley airport with services from Phoenix, LA and Las Vegas.

HoliMont, New York, USA



Who for: Upstate New York set, Pennsylvania pilgrims, families

HoliMont, a contraction of "Holiday Mountain," opened in 1962 and is now the largest private ski club in the United States.

It's open to the public during the week but weekends are reserved for the 4,000 members to enjoy the 52 tree-lined trails, eight lifts and 135 skiable acres, with plans to develop the Westmont Ridge ski area.

The skiing rises to a high point of 2,260 feet, giving a 700-foot vertical drop amid the rolling Enchanted Mountains near Lake Erie.

The initiation fees begin from about $10,000, with family dues from $177 per month.

Accommodation is in the Ellicottville area although there are plans to add real estate near Westmont Ridge.

Alpine Ski Club, Ontario, Canada



Who for: Toronto types, lovers of lake views

Alpine evolved from a traveling band of skiing enthusiasts to a club with a permanent site on the Niagara escarpment in the Blue Mountains in 1960.

It grew from a few hand-hewn runs and a rope tow to today's 120 acres and 36 runs served by five lifts.

The 760 feet of elevation spans beginners runs at the base area to more advanced terrain higher up with five double-black expert runs known as "The Steeps."

The glass-fronted contemporary clubhouse opened in 2016 with views of the escarpment and across to Georgian Bay on Lake Huron.

Alpine is one of a number of small private ski clubs in the area, including Craigleith, Georgian Peaks and Beaver Valley.

Getting there: Alpine Ski Club is 100 miles and a two-hour drive north of Toronto.

Temple Basin, South Island, New Zealand



Who for: Back-to-basics fans, the non-designer ski suit set

New Zealand is renowned for its "clubbies," small back-to-basics ski fields operated by club members. They're open to the public, too, but one, Temple Basin, has what locals call the "Range Rover filter" to dissuade the latte-drinking, designer ski-suit set.

"TB" can only be reached on foot -- a 50-minute haul up a jeep track while your luggage is whisked up in the goods lift. This gives it an air of privacy for the hardcore NZ skiers for whom enjoying a raw mountain experience -- there are no groomed runs either -- is more important than heated chairlifts and hot tubs.

The three rope tows -- accessed via a "nutcracker" metal clamp which grabs the moving rope and is attached to a waist harness -- open up 790 acres of skiable area and a variety of descents for intermediates and above including some steep, rocky big-mountain terrain for experts.

For those bitten by the bug, there is bunkhouse accommodation offering dinner, bed and breakfast.

Getting there: It's a two-hour drive from Christchurch to Arthur's Pass followed by a 50-minute walk to the ski area.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/08/health/india-newborn-dead-hospital-license-canceled/index.htmlAfter mistakenly declaring newborn dead, New Delhi hospital loses licenseNew Delhi (CNN) The Delhi government has canceled the license of a private hospital where a newborn baby was mistakenly declared dead.

The baby boy was born at the Max Super Specialty Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi on November 30 and mistakenly pronounced dead two hours after birth, the boy's grandfather, Praveen Malik, told CNN.

The newborn was then moved to the Delhi New Born Center, but unfortunately passed away on Wednesday morning.

Speaking with CNN after the baby's death on Wednesday, Malik said the family was devastated. "Our final demand with the government, with the world, is that we need justice," he said.

The hospital's license was canceled by the Delhi government Friday.

"Delhi is India's capital and as the capital, we have to be exemplary. What happened in this case is unacceptable," said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain at a press conference on Friday.

The cancellation applies to the Max Hospital in Delhi's Shalimar Bagh which is just one branch of the private healthcare chain known as Max Healthcare.

Current patients will be offered the opportunity to move facilities and are allowed to continue their treatment, but the hospital cannot accept new patients, added Jain.

In response, Max Healthcare said the ruling was harsh and that they have not been given adequate opportunity to be heard.

"We believe that even if there is an individual error of judgment, holding the hospital responsible is unfair and will severely limit the ability for patients to access treatment," they said in a statement. "This will compound the shortage of hospital facilities in the National Capital."

The company added that they will explore all options available to them.

An unacceptable case

The baby's mother had given birth to twins on November 30 but the girl was declared stillborn.

On the way to the cremation ground, approximately two hours later, the family found the boy still breathing after noticing "some movements" inside one of the polythene bags containing the babies' bodies.

"When we opened the bag, we found the boy breathing. I was shocked. I couldn't believe my eyes," Malik said in a previous CNN report.

The newborn did eventually pass away days later at the Delhi New Born Center.

Dr. Sandeep Gupta, who was treating the baby at the new facility told CNN the baby was 22-weeks premature, which meant the risk he may not survive was always there.

"We knew from the beginning that he may not survive but we were trying our best, had the baby not been exposed for so many hours after his birth, maybe we could have probably prolonged his life longer," he said.

Gupta said the baby died due to multiple organ dysfunction. "He was unable to keep his vitals up."

Max Healthcare fired the two doctors considered responsible earlier this week, but emphasized that the decision to let the doctors go should not be interpreted as an admission of guilt.

"We wish to clarify that this action should not presuppose finding of any lapse by the expert group and should not be construed in any way to be anything other than an expression of our continued commitment to providing quality healthcare," Max Healthcare said Sunday.

Ongoing inquiries

This case of medical negligence has received significant attention from local politicians.

State Health Minister Satyendar Jain tweeted last week that he has ordered an inquiry "into this unacceptable act."

The Delhi government's preliminary inquiry report was submitted to the Delhi health minister on Tuesday; it found the hospital guilty of not having followed prescribed medical norms when dealing with newborn infants, a Delhi government official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the report told CNN.

"No ECG (electrocardiography) tracings were done to trace whether the child was alive," the source said, referring to the findings of the initial report.

"In the meantime, we are fully cooperating with all relevant authorities on this issue," the statement said.-1
http://cnn.com/2017/12/08/asia/japan-missiles-purchase-intl/index.htmlJapan to buy long-range missiles for first timeTokyo (CNN) Japan will for the first time buy long-range missiles to counter the country's "increasingly severe" national security situation, Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said.

"We will implement stand-off missiles capable of defending ourselves adequately, when we are outside the range of the opponent, in order to ensure the safety of the Self Defense Force and to defend our nation effectively," Onodera told reporters.

A spokesman from Onodera's office told CNN Japan will be purchasing two typesof missiles -- Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles -- from Lockheed Martin to put on its F-15 fighter jets.

It will also buy Joint Strike Missiles from the Norwegian company Kongsberg to be deployed on new, state-of-the-art F-35 stealth fighter jets which are just joining the Japan Air Self Defense Force fleet.

The spokesman also said Japan will be making an additional request in next year's budget to make the purchase.

Though Onodera did not mention North Korea by name in the announcement, Pyongyang's fast-progressing nuclear and missile programs have had Japan and other countries in East Asia on edge. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test-firing of two missiles that overflew northern Japan this year, which set off warning sirens. The United Nations passed the most punishing sanctions ever levied against North Korea shortly after.

"North Korea's advancements made it inevitable that Tokyo and Seoul would purchase standoff strike capabilities," Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, told CNN in an email.

"Standoff missiles will ensure that Japan has a credible response to attacks against its territory, which will help them deter these strikes in the first place."

The news of the purchase itself comes about a month after US President Donald Trump visited Tokyo and suggested Japan should buy US military equipment.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was re-elected by a landslide in October's national elections after campaigning on a platform to continue his tough approach toward Pyongyang.

In the face of an increasingly hostile North Korea, Abe set a deadline of 2020 to revise Japan's constitution, which contains language that bans the country's military from undertaking many offensive capabilities. The proposal is controversial because it strikes at the heart of the country's post-war identity.

The missiles purchased would give Japanese fighter jets the ability to strike ground- or sea-based targets of all its neighbors, including China.

"As we rush to respond to North Korea's advancements, almost nobody is thinking about the long-term implications for regional stability. These new capabilities will exacerbate China's worry that it is being encircled," said Mount.

China, which suffered heavily when the Japanese occupied parts of the country during World War II, is likely to view the purchases with unease. Tokyo and Beijing have long feuded over other regional issues, including the disputed ownership of uninhabited islands in the waters near both countries.

"The developments will surely cause new tensions with China," Mount said.

Experts believe that one of the key reasons Beijing opposes North Korea's development of nuclear weapons is the concern that it could fuel an arms race in the region, especially with Tokyo, a historic adversary.

Beijing was strongly opposed to South Korea's deployment of the US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, a defensive weapon designed to shoot down ballistic missiles before they can cause damage. Weapons experts believe China worried about the system's powerful radar, the coverage of which extends into Chinese territory.

The deployment led to a months-long freeze in relations between Seoul and Beijing, which was resolved in October.

'An established fact'

The North Korean threat to the United States and its allies has come back to the forefront after a brief lull in recent weeks. Pyongyang test-fired what is believed to be its most advanced long-range missile in the final days of November, demonstrating a range of more than 8,000 miles.

After the test, White House national security adviser HR McMaster said the chance of war with North Korea is increasing by the day.

This week , the US and South Korea conducted large-scale aerial military exercises involving hundreds of aircraft and thousands of troops. North Korea views these drills with hostility and worries they could be practice for a potential invasion.

This week's exercises followed a large-scale naval exercise in November that saw three US Navy aircraft carriers drilling together in the Pacific for the first time in a decade.

"The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the US in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean Peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the U.S. high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula an established fact," a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Minister said, according to state-run Korean Central News Agency.

The air is heavy with the scent of rosewater and incense. And the sound of qawwali is ringing in the background.

It's Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, the shrine of Sufi saint Khwaja Nizamuddin and a pilgrimage site for Sufi devotees from around the world.

Qawwali: The sacred music

Qawwali is a popular musical form associated with Sufi music in India

It's a fusion of devotional poetry and Hindustani music and was developed by the great Indian scholar, poet and mystic Amir Khusrow.

And the shrine is home to one of the most famous Qawwali families, the Nizami Bandhu, who have been singing at Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah for hundreds of years.

In Qawwali, words are more important than music, with a repetition of verses.

"The musician will start with a certain set of notes and will keep repeating them, repeating them over and over again in any form over a small melody. He is creating an atmosphere."

Great tourist destination

The surrounding Nizamuddin Basti neighborhood is a destination in its own right.

"It still ticks all the boxes of being a great tourist place. The place is beautiful architecturally. It has a sense of history. The food around the place is spectacularly good," says Kilam.

"So you have everybody from everywhere and from every walk of life here."

http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/12/investing/bitcoin-regulators-warning-risk/index.htmlRegulators on Bitcoin and other digital currencies: Investors bewareBitcoin euphoria is prompting two top U.S. regulators to reiterate warnings about the potential risks of investing in digital currencies.

As investors rushed to amass Bitcoins this week, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman Christopher Giancarlo reissued similar cautionary messages to Main Street investors and those who advise them: Buyer beware.

"If a promoter guarantees returns, if an opportunity sounds too good to be true, or if you are pressured to act quickly, please exercise extreme caution and be aware of the risk that your investment may be lost," said Clayton in a statement after U.S. markets closed on Monday.

Related: Bitcoin vs history's biggest bubbles: They never end well

Clayton spelled out his concerns over cryptocurrencies and so-called initial coin offerings. Startups sometimes raise money by selling virtual currency in exchange for a stake in the company. They are also sometimes redeemed for future services.

But to avoid getting duped he reminded investors that not a single initial coin offering had been registered with the SEC. Nor had the agency approved any listing and trading of any exchanged-trade products holding digital currencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.

"If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary," said Clayton.

The CFTC's Giancarlo quickly endorsed Clayton's statement Monday evening, while also issuing his own advice to investors.

"Virtual currencies are unlike any commodity that the CFTC has dealt with in the past, and I know they pose challenges for the SEC," Giancarlo said. "Investors should be aware of the potentially high level of volatility and risk in these markets."

The alerts came less than a day after the first Bitcoin futures began trading on an exchange run by Cboe Global Markets Inc. Its larger rival CME Group Inc. will introduce its own Bitcoin futures next week.

Related: Bitcoin: What's driving the frenzy?

The price of Bitcoin soared to $17,478 in futures trading on the Cboe market on Tuesday. A year ago, one Bitcoin was worth less than $1,000.

Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve's regulatory czar, stepped up his concerns last month over the virtual currency's price run-up.

"While these digital currencies may not pose major concerns at their current levels of use, more serious financial stability issues may result if they achieve wide scale usage," he said during a speech at a Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland conference.

Earlier this month, the two exchanges cleared a regulatory hurdle with the CFTC after "extensive discussions," which included making significant changes to their proposals on how to reduce potential market manipulation.

Futures are a way for traders to bet on whether the price of a commodity, such as oil or gold, will rise or fall. Having a futures contract provides retail investors with an easier way to trade Bitcoin. It also allows Wall Street banks and trading firms to protect themselves against price swings in digital currency.

Despite the CFTC's approval of the deal, Giancarlo has repeatedly said it does not equal an endorsement of the product. He's also warned investors that the "underlying cash markets and exchanges for Bitcoin remain largely unregulated markets" which the agency has "limited statutory authority" over.

Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin: Here's what I learned

It's not the first time the agencies have raised red flags over cryptocurrencies. Each agency has issued investor alerts, bulletins and statements on initial coin offerings and digital currency investments.

And while the SEC doesn't regulate Bitcoin per se, it has flexed its muscles on initial coin offerings.

Several start ups have used the tokens to raise money. Earlier Monday, the agency shut down plans by a food review site, Munchee, that was trying to raise $15 million in a digital coin offering to improve its app.

While the SEC chairman didn't completely shut the door on investing in such innovative products, he urged Main Street investors to ask the right questions before taking the leap.

"Who is issuing and sponsoring the product, what are their backgrounds, and have they provided a full and complete description of the product? Do they have a clear written business plan that I understand? What specific rights come with my investment?" Clayton suggested as part of more than a dozen questions investors should ask before making any Bitcoin investment.0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/13/investing/adnoc-ipo-gas-stations/index.htmlAbu Dhabi: ADNOC gas stations IPO makes strong debutFor the first time in six years, the stock market in Abu Dhabi has a new addition.

The state oil producer -- Abu Dhabi National Oil Company -- floated 10% of its retail distribution subsidiary on Wednesday in an initial public offering that raised $851 million.

The shares soared as much as 16% on their debut, before closing 6% above the IPO price.

The stock market debut is the largest in Abu Dhabi in a decade after companies put plans to go public on hold following the global financial crisis and an oil price collapse.

ADNOC says it is the world's 12th largest oil producer. It is fully owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.

Its distribution unit operates 360 gas stations and 235 convenience stores across the country, except for the emirate of Dubai.

The proceeds from the IPO, which valued ADNOC's distribution business at $8.5 billion, should help it expand to Dubai, as well as Saudi Arabia, which is opening up its economy.

ADNOC has 17 divisions and plans eventually to sell other stakes too.

"This is part of our ongoing holistic transformation," Sultan Al Jaber, ADNOC Group CEO told CNNMoney's emerging markets editor John Defterios. "It's simply to help maximize value, unlock potential, drive efficiency and enhance our performance."

Many regional oil companies have been forced to rethink their strategies after prices crashed in 2014 and 2015.

Saudi Arabia is taking a slightly different approach to Abu Dhabi. It plans to privatize a chunk of its giant oil company Aramco, rather than sell off shares in its operating divisions.

Saudi officials have been preparing to list Aramco on the stock market next year via an IPO they expect could value the world's biggest oil producer at around $2 trillion.

If the market agrees, selling just 5% of the company would raise $100 billion -- four times as much as Alibaba's (BABA) IPO in 2014, the largest to date.0

In South Korea, students are checking the price between classes, workers are trading it as they line up for coffee, and grandparents are playing the market at home.

Virtual currencies might be a fringe play elsewhere -- but in South Korea, they're mainstream. The country is home to three of the world's biggest bitcoin exchanges. On any given day, South Korea accounts for as much as 20% of all bitcoin trades around the world.

"First, it was just tech people. Now, literally everyone is interested in bitcoin," said Isaac Chung, a college student who says he's made thousands of dollars trading digital currencies.

Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin. Here's what I learned

Bitcoin's value has jumped 1,500% so far this year to $17,000 as more and more people have bought into it.

It's in such high demand on Korean exchanges that South Koreans often end up paying a premium of between 15% and 25% over global prices. Local traders call it the "kimchi premium," referencing the country's popular fermented cabbage dish.

Mom-and-pop investors are willing to pay a higher price in the hope that bitcoin will continue its dizzying rise.

"They see it as gambling in some ways, they try to earn more money by using exchanges," said Kim Duyoung, a manager at bitcoin brokerage Coinplug.

Related: What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin exchanges like Bithumb have moved beyond their online beginnings, opening storefronts and customer service bays to make trading in virtual money even easier.

Im Mi-ae, a middle-aged woman who came into one Bithumb store recently to learn how to use the online trading tool, is exactly the type of customer it wants.

"I started a month ago," she said. "I had someone I know who told me that this is good and that I should try it. That's why I'm doing it."

With so many small investors diving in, authorities are getting worried about the potential impact of a crash.

South Korea's government last week said it was forming a special task force to study the "cryptocurrency problem."

It's banning some activities linked to digital currencies, including the trading of bitcoin futures. It's also reviewing whether to tax virtual currency profits and transactions.

Related: North Korea may be making a fortune from bitcoin mania

What's more, the South Korean government fears virtual currencies are arming North Korea with new financial weapons, making it easier to steal and launder funds. And it warns North Korean hackers will aggressively target virtual currency exchanges in the future.

But despite all the concerns, Chung is still bullish. He predicts there will be more opportunities to profit from bitcoin's volatile moves.

"There is so much fear and greed going on at the same time," he said.

The European Commission said that the deal "demonstrates the powerful political will of Japan and the EU to continue to keep the flag of free trade waving high."

"We are sending a message to other countries about the importance of free and fair trade, and of shaping globalization," Cecilia Malmström, Europe's top trade official, said in a statement.

The deal must be signed off by individual EU countries before it is implemented.

Closer ties between Europe and the world's No.3 economy could make it harder for U.S. businesses to compete with global rivals, especially when it comes to selling agricultural products such as pork to Japan.

After quitting the TPP, the U.S. showed interest in reaching a separate free trade deal with Japan. The two sides held talks in April, but those have since taken a back seat to Trump's push to renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico and Canada.0
http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/technology/startups/social-startups-accelerators/index.htmlThese investors are giving social startups a breakStarting a business is tricky enough. Starting a business with a mission to improve the lives of millions or save the planet is even harder.

So-called "social entrepreneurs" face bigger challenges than other company founders in converting their ideas into viable businesses. Investors are harder to find, and there are fewer established networks to provide support.

Now help is at hand, with a growing number of companies offering money, office space and training programs to help these fledgling firms get off the ground.

"Our objective when selecting entrepreneurs is to find ideas that can become a business worth over £50 million within ten years. We are looking for impact and scale, ideas that can help millions of people," said Joe Ludlow, managing partner at London's Bethnal Green Ventures (BGV).

BGV supports entrepreneurs who want to use technology to change people's lives for the better. Since 2011, it has backed 104 "tech-for-good" startups, investing £2 million ($2.7 million) in total in exchange for a 6% stake in each.

"We are trying to demonstrate that investing in tech-for-good can be comparable in terms of return to investing in other early stage technology companies," Ludlow said.

Graduates of BGV's accelerator program have raised £39 million ($52.6 million) from impact investors, mainstream venture capital funds and private foundations.

Raising money

Finding the capital to achieve a viable scale is one of the biggest challenges for "impact businesses," partly because the startup scene is so dispersed, according to Luni Libes, who set up Fledge in 2012 to help entrepreneurs with a mission as well as a profit motive.

"There are fewer investors and they can be harder to find," Libes said. "There is no equivalent of Silicon Valley for social good startups, there's no one place where people are flooding to to start these types of ventures."

Fledge is headquartered in Seattle, but it also runs accelerator programs in Peru and Spain, and will expand to Canada and Italy in 2018.

So far, more than 80 startups from 22 countries have gone through Fledge's accelerator program, which offers mentoring and entrepreneurship education, and prepares social enterprises to attract new investors.

Among its graduates is Evrnu, a startup that has developed a process to recycle cotton and partnered with Levis to develop recycled jeans.

Fledge invests $15,000 to $20,000 in each of its "fledglings." In return it gets a 6% stake in the company. So far it has invested $1.7 million.

"We're not investing for an exit, but for a share of future revenues," Libes said. "Many of the companies I work with have no desire to sell or go public. They are driven by their mission, not dollars. They want to solve big problems."

Building a community

Entrepreneurs also need to feel part of a community when building their businesses, according to Henrique Bussacos, a partner at Impact Hub.

Impact Hub describes itself as "part innovation lab, part business incubator, and part community center." It opened its first hub in London in 2005, and now has a network of almost 100 around the world.

For social enterprises that wish to scale, choosing the right approach is key.

"Social enterprises are focused on scaling their impact, this doesn't always mean scaling their financial figures at the same pace," Bussacos said.

And as social enterprises grow, they can help a new wave of impact businesses get off the ground.

For example, the Impact Investment Exchange supports companies through its ACTS accelerator program, which is subsidized by partner grants. Once companies have raised capital from investors, they pay back into the program, enabling it to support a new crop of startups.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/11/health/huntingtons-disease-drug-trial-study/index.htmlHuntington's disease: Drug trial shows promising results(CNN) For the first time, an experimental drug has reduced levels of the toxic protein that causes Huntington's disease in humans.

Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder in which mutant forms of the huntingtin protein damage nerve cells in the brain.

The new drug, Ionis-HTTRx, was shown to be safe in humans and lowered levels of mutant huntingtin protein in the nervous systems of trial participants.

"The results of this trial are of groundbreaking importance for Huntington's disease patients and families," said Sarah Tabrizi, director of University College London's Huntington's Disease Centre, who led the trial. "The key now is to move quickly to a larger trial to test whether the drug slows disease progression."

The trial involved 46 patients at early stages of the disease who were enrolled across nine centers in the UK, Germany and Canada. Initial results were announced Monday.

Each patient received four doses of either the new drug or a placebo, injected directly into spinal fluid so it could easily reach the brain. For those receiving the drug, the dose was increased over time, and safety was monitored throughout, according to a statement.

Concentrations of the toxic protein were measured in the patients' spinal fluid before and after the injections.

Among people receiving Ionis-HTTRx, the team saw a significant decline in levels of mutant huntingtin, which causes symptoms of the disease, with higher doses having greater impact. This is the first time the protein has been lowered in patients with the condition.

"The results are encouraging, as it shows delivering therapeutic agents of this type is feasible and well-tolerated and the treatment has done what it said it would: namely, drop the relevant protein levels," said Roger Barker, professor of clinical neuroscience and honorary consultant neurologist at the University of Cambridge, who worked with six patients involved in the trial.

"The question is whether this is enough to make a difference to patients and their clinical course, and that we will have to wait for bigger trials," he said.

The team now plans to conduct a larger-scale trial in hundreds of patients across multiple centers, said Ed Wild, a principal researcher at UCL's Huntington's Disease Centre, who worked on the trial with Tabrizi.

Hunting down huntingtin

Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder in which nerve cells in the brain are damaged, causing uncontrolled movements, changes in behavior and emotions, and altered cognition.

The disease typically begins affecting people between the ages of 30 and 50 and gets progressively worse over time. Children of a parent with the disease have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant gene.

An estimated 30,000 Americans are living with the disease. About 10,000 people in the UK have it, and a further 25,000 are at risk.

The condition is caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene, which encodes the huntingtin protein, which is needed for normal development before birth and thought to help brain cells function, though the exact function is unknown . The mutant form of this protein accumulates and binds together to become toxic to certain brain cells, eventually killing them.

A drug with the ability to reduce levels of the toxic protein would mean progression of the disease could be slowed or even stopped.

"The details of this study have not been peer-reviewed or published yet, so the scientific community simply does not know yet how robust the findings are," noted Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research.

"With that caveat in mind, the approach used in this trial has excellent potential to prevent Huntington's disease," she said, "and if the next stage of larger trials live up to their promise, this will be a breakthrough."

How the drug works

The drug consists of a single strand of DNA that targets genetic material within brain cells, called mRNA, that helps translate genes into proteins.

In this case, the drug specifically sought out mRNA that helps translate huntingtin genes into huntingtin proteins and stopped production of the protein -- both the healthy and toxic forms.

"Less of the protein is made," Wild said, adding that the healthy form of the protein is known to play a vital role in early childhood development but not necessarily during adulthood, whereas the toxic form damages nerve cells in adults. "That protein is the cause of all of the problems" in Huntington's disease.

'A game-changer'?

It's hoped this form of drug could be adapted to target proteins in other currently incurable brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.

By changing the DNA sequence in the drug, researchers can target any mRNA, Wild said. In other neurodegenerative diseases, "there is at least one protein you would like to partially reduce," he said. One example is tau protein in Alzheimer's disease. "This is proof of principle you can inject these drugs into spinal fluid; they get into the brain and reduce harmful proteins."

"This is a potential game-changer, not only for Huntington's disease patients but also for genomic medicine in general," said Philippa Brice of health policy think tank the PHG Foundation.

"Though more work needs to be done, if gene silencing lives up to this promise, we could be on the brink of some of the personalized treatments that patients with severe genetic diseases need so badly. But this will also raise further questions for society and for policy-makers about how best to use such a powerful technique," Brice said.

The drug was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals but has been taken over by Roche, which will lead the development of the next, larger trial and handle future licensing of the drug, Wild said. The full results of the trial and plans for future trials will be presented next year.2
http://cnn.com/2017/12/11/health/aetna-surgery-denied-for-girl/index.htmlGirl has words for Aetna after brain surgery was deniedThe author of the story has a family member with an uncontrolled seizure disorder who does not medically qualify for either type of brain surgery mentioned in the piece nor has the family member been denied care by an insurance provider.

(CNN) Cara Pressman sobbed in the big red chair in her living room. The 15-year-old tried to absorb the devastating news relayed by her parents: that their insurance company, Aetna, denied her for a minimally invasive brain surgery that could end the seizures that have haunted her since she was 9 years old.

"When my parents told me, I went kind of blank and started crying," she said. "I cried for like an hour."

Her friends had been lined up to visit her in the hospital for the surgery three days away, on Monday, October 23. Between tears, she texted them that the whole thing was off.

It was supposed to be a joyous weekend. Cara's grandparents had come to town to celebrate their 90th birthdays, a jubilant party with more than 100 family and friends crowding her home. The party did go on -- just with a lot more stress.

Cara had multiple complex partial seizures that weekend. When the seizures strike, her body gets cold and shakes, and she zones out for anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes, typically still aware of her surroundings. Her seizures can be triggered by stress, by being happy, by exerting herself -- almost anything. "It's like having a nightmare but while you're awake," she said.

In the six weeks since the denial, Cara has had more than two dozen seizures affecting her everyday life. Her message to Aetna is blunt: "Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, 'Screw you.' ''

Aetna: We're looking out for what's best for patients

The Pressman family and, separately, Jennifer Rittereiser, a 44-year-old mom who has struggled with seizures since she was 10, approached CNN in recent weeks after they were both denied, by Aetna, for laser ablation surgery, a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures are originating. Aetna is the third-largest health insurance provider in the country, providing medical coverage to 23.1 million people.

Neurologists consider laser ablation, which is performed through a small hole in the skull, to be safer and more precise than traditional brain surgery, where the top portion of the skull is removed in order for doctors to operate. The procedure is less daunting for the patient and parents who make decisions for their children: No one likes the idea of a skull opened and a chunk of brain removed.

In denying Cara her surgery, Aetna said it considers laser ablation surgery "experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established."

"Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures effective for treatment of the member's condition," Aetna wrote in its rejection letter.

The insurance company did approve her for the more invasive and more expensive open brain surgery, called a temporal lobectomy, even though her medical team never sought approval for the procedure.

The laser surgery is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is widely recognized within the epilepsy community as an effective treatment alternative to open brain surgery, especially when the location of seizure activity can be pinpointed to a specific part of the brain.

Dr. Jamie Van Gompel, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic, disputes Aetna's assessment. He is not involved in Cara's care nor Rittereiser's treatment, but he said Aetna's assessment is wrong.

"I would not call it experimental at all," said Van Gompel, who is leading a clinical trial on the surgery at Mayo as part of a larger national study. "It's definitely not an experimental procedure. There've been thousands of patients treated with it. It's FDA-approved. There's a lot of data out there to suggest it's effective for epilepsy."

Van Gompel said a temporal lobectomy carries a much higher risk of serious complications, including the possibility of death. "It's a big jump to go to a big invasive procedure," he said.

Recovery time after open brain surgery can range from six to 12 weeks. By contrast, a patient who undergoes laser ablation can be back to work or at school in less than two weeks. The pain from laser surgery is much less, and extreme headaches are fewer than with open brain surgery, Van Gompel said.

While laser ablation has not yet undergone large randomized controlled trials, Van Gompel said existing data shows it's effective more than 50% of the time. He hopes the current clinical trial will show a success rate of 60% to 70% or better in epilepsy patients. Temporal lobectomies, he said, have a slightly better rate, of more than 70%.

Pressed by CNN for a better explanation on its denial, Aetna stood by its rejection for Cara and Rittereiser, saying it was in the best interest of the patients. But the language was softened slightly.

Cara Pressman was 9 when her seizures started. She's had them in the classroom, on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays.

"Clinical effectiveness and our members' safety are the primary criteria we use in determining whether a treatment or service is medically necessary," Aetna said. "There is currently a limited amount of evidence-based, clinical studies related to laser ablation surgery. As noted by the Epilepsy Foundation, only studies with a very small number of participants have been used to report the effectiveness of this procedure. We consistently evaluate any new studies or additional evidence when developing our clinical policy bulletins, and will continue to do so for this procedure."

Contacted for reaction, the Epilepsy Foundation strongly objected to Aetna's remarks, saying the insurance company took its information out of context. Laser ablation surgery "has emerged as a new minimally invasive surgical option that is best suited for patients with symptomatic localization-related epilepsy," said Dr. Jacqueline French, the chief science officer with the Epilepsy Foundation.

"This technology is much less invasive than the alternative, which involves removing a sizeable piece of brain, at a substantially higher monetary and personal cost," French said. "This path should be available, if the treating epilepsy physician has recommended it, without delay or barriers."

Phil Gattone, the president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation, said insurance denials and other barriers to treatment have become a common battle for thousands of Americans with seizure disorders.

Jennifer Rittereiser, 44, was denied laser ablation surgery. She was hoping the surgery would stop her seizures so she could spend more quality time with her sons.

Gattone knows first-hand the pain of what Cara's parents are going through. His own son began having seizures when he was 4 and underwent brain surgery in the early 1990s. "It was extremely challenging for our family to make a decision to remove part of our child's skull and brain for a surgery that we hoped would end the devastation of seizures that were stopping his development," Gattone said. "We took this leap of faith and made the decision, and it worked out the best for him."

But he added that he and his wife wished laser ablation surgery had been available back then. The device used for laser ablation surgery was approved by the FDA nine years ago. "I know that my wife and I would've found much more comfort if we had had (laser ablation) as an option," he said.

Gattone said people with seizures, their caregivers and their doctors should not be "spending critical time in the midst of a health-care crisis, filing paperwork, making appeals or otherwise going through the motions of administrative paperwork" trying to get approval for a life-changing operation.

"The Epilepsy Foundation can understand no reason why an insurance company would place any barrier to delay a treatment that may save an individual's life, promote the development of the young child's brain or bring about seizure control," Gattone said.

Mom who crashed with kid in car gets denied

Jennifer Rittereiser lost consciousness behind the wheel of her silver SUV while driving with her 7-year-old son, Robert, in April. Her SUV rammed into a car in front of her and struck it again before veering into oncoming traffic. Her vehicle careened down an embankment, flipped over and came to rest on its side amid a tangle of brush. She narrowly missed slamming into a guardrail and several trees.

Mom and son somehow managed to walk free unharmed.

Jennifer Rittereiser's SUV plunged into an embankment after she had a seizure while driving in April.

"People were amazed," she said. "They had a helicopter on the way, actually. I am extremely fortunate just from that sense."

Rittereiser has battled seizures since she was 10 and has been able to function with an array of medications in the three decades since. For much of her life, she could tell when the seizures might come.

These weren't like the seizures depicted in Hollywood movies; she wouldn't fall to the ground and writhe. She would zone out for a spell. She could understand people and could still function but couldn't speak back -- or if she did, her words were garbled.

As an executive in the health care industry, Rittereiser has fallen asleep during meetings. When she senses a seizure coming, she rushes to the bathroom to hide until they go away. One time, she says she urinated on herself at her desk without realizing it.

Rittereiser had a crash in 2014 in which she rear-ended a car after she had a seizure. No one was hurt in that crash, but she stopped driving for more than a year. Her medications were tweaked, and her seizures were largely kept in check, until the crash this April.

She was soon evaluated by an array of doctors and recommended for laser ablation surgery. After 34 years of struggling with seizures, she thought her ordeal might finally come to an end. Surgery was set for June 16.

But in late May, Aetna denied the surgery. She fought Aetna's decision through a lengthy appeals process. Aetna refused to budge.

"It's just not right," Rittereiser said.

She said she recently went to Aetna's website to look up the company's values. She felt nauseated. "Everything in their core values is not being shown in the way I'm being treated. They're talking about promoting wellness and health and 'being by your side.' "

She paused, contemplating the company's "by your side" catchphrase, saying it's "the most ridiculous thing, because they are the biggest barrier to my success and my well-being going forward.

"It drives me crazy."

Dad: 'You get so angry'

Julie Pressman stood near an elevator at her doctor's office when word came that Cara's surgery had been denied. The mom fell to the floor and wept.

She called Cara's father, Robert. He was at the airport picking up his 90-year-old parents for their birthday party. Mom and Dad rallied for their daughter and gathered strength to break the news. That's when Cara sat in the red chair, crying inconsolably.

Julie Pressman says she will never give up the fight for her daughter.

"Telling Cara was horrible," her mom said. "Horrible."

"It's just so frustrating for us to know there's a solution out there -- a way to fix our daughter -- and some bureaucratic machine is preventing this from happening," Robert Pressman said. "You get so angry, but you don't know who to take it out on, because there's no particular person that's doing it. It's this big bureaucracy that's preventing this from happening."

Julie and Robert said the most beautiful day of their lives came on August 20, 2002, when Cara popped into the world and met her 2-year-old sister, Lindsey, for the first time. "That was the day we became a family," Julie said. "Our love for those girls is amazing. How we got this lucky is beyond us."

But that luck has been tested. When Cara was 9, she'd complained of extreme headaches for much of the day one evening, and then in the middle of the night, she began seizing uncontrollably. The family had two black Labradors that had gone to her room and barked like crazy to alert her parents. Cara had bitten her tongue, and blood was running down her face when they got to the room.

It was a terrifying scene. She was rushed off in an ambulance and underwent a battery of tests. Mom, Dad and Cara never thought they'd still be battling seizures six years later -- let alone an insurance company. She's had seizures on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays, in the classroom. Almost everywhere.

How does she envision a life without seizures?

"I don't know," she said. "I've never had a life without seizures."

"You will. You will," her dad told her.

"I just don't know when," she responded.

Mom: "It will happen, kiddo."

Her mother calls Cara a feisty, petite powerhouse with big marble eyes and long eyelashes and a funny wit to match. She's a naturally gifted athlete, singer and dancer, but her parents feel that her seizures have kept her from reaching her full potential.

They long for the day when the seizures are gone. The parents said they have paid $24,000 for insurance with Aetna this year. They're determined to get Cara laser ablation surgery with or without the insurance company's help. They will appeal Aetna's latest rejection -- but they're not optimistic.

In preparation, they've begun exploring raiding their retirement funds to pay the $300,000 out of pocket. "Cara is worth every penny, but man," her mom said. " 'Screw Aetna,' indeed, to quote my kid."-1

http://cnn.com/2017/12/13/opinions/mario-batali-restaurant-sexual-harassment-tia-keenan-opinion/index.htmlBatali shows the dark side of hospitality ideal (opinion)Tia Keenan is a writer, cook and cheese specialist. She is the author of "The Art of the Cheese Plate: Pairings, Recipes, Style, Attitude." The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) I've never been assaulted by Mario Batali, who stepped away from his restaurant business and ABC television show amid allegations of sexual misconduct this week. But I know someone who allegedly was.

Tia Keenan

At the time, she was a rising star in the industry working in one of the finest restaurants in the world. She'd made the mistake (if you could call it that) of partying after hours with a group of fellow restaurant rock stars, who eventually trickled away and left her alone with Batali. A busser interrupted the assault, and she fled. She called me at 2 a.m., sobbing from the sidewalk in front of his restaurant. "He tried to rape me! What do I do?" she was screaming. "What do I do? What do I do?"

Sadly, I didn't have the answer that night, and I don't have it today. If she had reported the assault, her star in the restaurant world surely would have been yanked back to earth. Although he was unaware of this specific allegation, Batali said on Monday that he is "deeply sorry" for the pain or humiliation he has caused "his peers, employees, customers, friends and family."

Restaurant workers are supposed to worship at the altar of comfort; it's repeated to us again and again that hospitality is above all a soothing of those who have more power than we do, a la "the customer is always right." Accusing a pillar of the industry of assault is the opposite of comforting for everyone: bosses, co-workers, diners, food media.

Even if she was believed (and that's a big "if"), she very likely would have been punished anyway for challenging the same givens of restaurant employment and culture I've always heard: abuse "just happens," silence is "taking one for the team," and "betraying" anyone who has more power than you is grounds for excommunication. Transgressors of these norms, usually women and people of color who refuse to keep quiet, are often described as "not cut out for the business."

Yes, Roy Moore was a deeply flawed candidate long before he was accused of sexual abuse, allegations he denies. But Alabama is a deep red state that has not elected a Democrat since 1992, and that Democrat, Richard Shelby, became a Republican just two years later.

Doug Jones ran a smart, Alabama-focused campaign, and stayed out of the national spotlight. He smartly focused on African-American turnout in the closing weeks and it worked.

As special elections go, this is an earthquake that will have repercussions far into 2018.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/11/opinions/tax-bill-crandall-opinion/index.htmlA former CEO's view: The GOP tax bill is both mean and stupidRobert L. Crandall is former CEO and chairman of American Airlines. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) On December 2, the Senate passed a tax bill that is both mean and stupid.

The bill is stupid because it cuts taxes for US corporations -- which are enjoying record profits and heady valuations -- and for the country's wealthiest citizens -- who have done spectacularly well and now control a larger share of the country's income and wealth than ever.

Moreover, it does so in part by eventually raising taxes on the US middle class, who have fallen behind in the economic race and need help rather than more taxes, and in part by increasing the already gigantic US debt.

It is particularly stupid because there is a broad consensus of bipartisan agencies and economists who agree it cannot increase growth by anywhere near enough to offset the revenue losses driven by the tax cuts. We've tested the idea that tax cuts pay for themselves several times and in each case, have found that growth-related revenue falls far short of replacing lost tax revenues.

The bill is mean because to force fit the tax cut into the convoluted reconciliation process the Senate is using to bypass the need to attract 60 votes, the bill incorporates and depends upon a wide variety of service cuts. It's not surprising that Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, has called the GOP tax plans, which include a House-passed version, a "moral abomination."

http://cnn.com/2017/12/12/opinions/brexit-allowing-europe-to-think-about-defense-opinion-blockmans/index.htmlBrexit is allowing Europe to get serious about defending itselfSteven Blockmans is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies, a think tank based in Brussels. The opinions in this article are those of the author.

(CNN) The theatrics surrounding the Brexit negotiations have caused many to pay little attention to something far more important when considering the future of Europe: the formal launch of the EU's "permanent structured cooperation" in defense.

Euroskeptics have for years derided such moves as an attempt to undermine NATO by forming some kind of parallel "EU Army." In reality, the plans are so moderate and the politics behind them so fraught that such concerns flatter those responsible.

Lack of political will and mutual trust among EU member states have long been an obstacle to more cooperation in the area of security and defense.

Facing a fraught security climate in the Arab world, EU member state leaders decided in 2013 to buck the trend. But progress has been slow.

Tapping into the political momentum generated by Russia's assault against Ukraine, the prospect of Brexit and the unpredictability injected into US foreign policy under Donald Trump, this time last year, European leaders instructed EU institutions to prepare the ground for strengthening the Union's common security and defense.

Twelve months later, a separate European defense fund has been created, along with an annual review mechanism to make sure member states are keeping up with their defense spending and planning, as well as a permanent headquarters.

On top of that, the EU is now formally launching the catchily-named permanent structured cooperation ("PESCO" in Eurospeak) between 24 member states for the development and deployment of defense capabilities.

Although this package was developed with remarkable speed -- in response to the sense that European countries should be offering better protection against the security threats within and outside of its borders -- the political rhetoric surrounding it has raised expectations that the Union may not be able to meet.

First, the German desire for inclusivity -- having as many as 25 member states on board in PESCO -- will ultimately hold back substantial progress in this field.

While the level of ambition described has thus far been maintained, the EU's decision-making by way of unanimity will mean that the speed with which any of this can happen will be determined by the slowest of the pack.

Poland may well replace the UK as the member state which most frequently slams on the brakes.

In the face of Russian aggression, the country relies on the provision of hard security guarantees by the US. Warsaw has long resisted the idea of EU defense integration for fear that it might undermine NATO's resolve in coming to the rescue in its hour of need.

Second, the new European defense fund has been touted as a "game changer" because it introduces an instrument whereby the European Commission can tap into the EU's general budget to finance initiatives in the area of defense.

The plan to earmark €1.5 billion a year after 2020 to spend on military research and development is indeed ground-breaking. But it is also conditional on a future agreement on the EU's post-Brexit financial framework.

And as things stand, the sums of money currently available -- and the arrangements to bring EU funds online for development and acquisition -- will fail to produce the big bang that the EU needs to create a military-industrial complex.

The potential to "turbo-charge defense spending" is likely to be limited to areas where EU-wide initiatives do not threaten national industries and local jobs and where transnational responses are required to meet challenges. A European cyber shield and drone force come to mind.

Third, the creation of a coordinated annual review on defense (CARD) also depends on trust.

The system is designed to encourage EU member states to synchronize their budgets and capability plans. Yet CARD operates on a voluntary basis. Short of suspending a member state from PESCO, it is unclear how compliance with the binding commitments will be enforced.

It is worth noting that none of these efforts are intended to duplicate or compete with NATO, but to streamline and improve the functioning of existing structures within the EU.

In fact, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has given his seal of approval to the EU's initiatives, provided that the two organizations act in a manner in which one doesn't undermine the other.

National governments operate a single set of forces, so by using joint instruments and developing member states' capabilities, the EU will strengthen capabilities that are also available to NATO and the United Nations.

A stronger EU will also be in the UK's interest once it has left the EU.

The British government's plans to forge a strong military partnership with the EU may seem ironic when considering the fact that as a member state, the UK constantly tried to prevent such progress.

But if Europe is to address the threats it faces from both inside and outside of its own borders, Britain and the EU will need to work together more closely than ever.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/09/opinions/trump-obama-economy-boykin-opinion/index.htmlOn the economy, Trump needs to get his statistics straightKeith Boykin is a CNN political commentator and a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Those were the words President Donald Trump tweeted on the first Friday in November when the Labor Department reported 261,000 jobs had been created the previous month. The figure was later revised downward to 244,000 , but it was still a decent report.

The latest numbers announced Friday by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics show 228,000 jobs were created last month. Trump will surely claim credit for this "achievement" as well.

Trump has touted the monthly jobs report numbers repeatedly throughout the year, and especially in the past month. Even on Thanksgiving, Trump tweeted : "HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well. Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER..."

The President also used the jobs number as a justification for his endorsement of accused child molester Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore. "Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda," Trump tweeted on Monday . He added: "Look at your 401-k's since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!"

But the reality is much different from the picture the President paints. In fact, it turns out he is a much better salesman than statistician.

The US economy has created 1.9 million jobs so far this year, according to Trump's own Labor Department. That's not bad, but during the same period, from January through November of last year, the economy created nearly 2.1 million jobs. Trump took office on January 20, 2017, but even if you remove January from the equation, the numbers still favor Obama. From February to November last year, the economy created 1.96 million jobs. During the same period this year, it created 1.7 million jobs.

Jobs are not "roaring back," as Trump claims. The job market is actually underperforming compared to last year. Average monthly job growth was 190,000 in the first 11 months of 2016, according to BLS. This year BLS figures show it has fallen to 174,000 per month.

The October 2017 numbers (244,000) from BLS were the strongest in Trump's presidency so far, and the only time the economy has gained more than 240,000 jobs in any month this year. The numbers may sound impressive when Trump brags about them, but the BLS reports that the economy added more jobs on three occasions (297,000 in June, 291,000 in July and 249,000 in September) last year under Obama.

JUST WATCHED Do good economic numbers help Trump? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Do good economic numbers help Trump? 04:07

Despite Trump's claim in February that he inherited a "mess" from Obama, he actually inherited a stable economy in the midst of the longest streak in history of consecutive monthly job growth, according to MarketWatch . Obama, on the other hand, inherited a failing economy that was losing nearly 800,000 jobs a month after the nearly fatal financial collapse and Bush recession, according to the Labor Department.

Of course, the economy goes up and down in cycles, and it's debatable how much influence any president can exert to control it. The job market affects real people, from schoolteachers to pipefitters to independent contractors, so this should not be a competition between presidents. The problem is that Trump has made the economy into a contest with his predecessor because of his longstanding disdain for President Obama.

Remember, Trump was campaigning around the country complaining that the economy was a disaster in the summer of 2016 when BLS reported American businesses created 764,000 jobs. But now Trump thinks the economy is roaring after creating only 556,000 jobs this past summer, according to BLS.

Trump never gave credit to Obama for the jobs numbers in 2016. Back then, he claimed the unemployment numbers were "one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics." Then, after he took office, he instructed former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to change his tune about the Labor Department figures: "They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now," Spicer told reporters in March.

For a president who has passed no major economic legislation to impact the economy, it's the height of hubris for Trump to take credit for presiding over the continuation of the Obama recovery. But, remember, Trump is first and foremost a salesman.

Even when it comes to the stock market, Trump loses to Obama. No doubt, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has performed well this year. From January 20, 2017, until the market closed on Thursday, the Dow rose from 19,827 to 24,211, a 4,384 point gain, according to MarketWatch

But compare those numbers to Obama's first year in 2009. The Dow rose from 7,949 on Obama's Inauguration Day in January 2009 to 10,390 on December 7, a gain of 2,441 points, according to MarketWatch . If you just look at the numbers, it looks like the market performed better under Trump. However, if you look at the percentages, you see the reality. The Dow rose nearly 31% in those first 11 months under Obama and only 22% this year under Trump, the MarketWatch figures show.

Yes, the economy is doing relatively well right now, but based on the numbers, that's nothing for Trump to brag about.0
http://cnn.com/2017/12/10/opinions/quasars-black-hole-opinion-lincoln/index.htmlThe mystery of the early universe's enormous black hole(CNN) For a scientist, perplexity is the most exhilarating state of mind, because unexpected phenomena are often the most direct path to discoveries. And a recent observation from one of the furthest corners of the universe -- an ancient and enormous black hole -- has set the astronomical world buzzing. It is hard to understand how a black hole became so big, so long ago.

Generally, black holes are the relic of massive and burned-out stars. They contain enough mass in a small enough volume to literally warp space and time, so much that not even light can escape them. One class of black holes originates from the death of stars; these contain as much mass as perhaps three to maybe thirty times that of our sun.

There is a second class of black holes that are much more massive and are found at the center of galaxies, like our own Milky Way. The recent scientific surprise involves a black hole from the second class, with a mass of about 800 million times that of our sun, that existed when our universe was a mere 690 million years old.

So why is that surprising? Black holes are like humans. They start out small and they grow over time. This particular black hole existed when the universe was only about 5% of its current age, and was located so far away that the light signaling its existence is only now arriving on Earth, after traveling for about thirteen billion years.

There is a lot of exciting and mind-blowing science that goes into understanding this most recent observation. The first point is that black holes are, well, black. They don't emit any light at all. Thus, what scientists observed was not the black hole itself, but rather a thing called a quasar, the first of which was discovered in 1962. Quasars, short for quasi-stellar object, are the brightest persistent things in the universe. They appear to be small and emit energy prodigiously.

The reason they seem small is because they are so incredibly far away. They were initially a mystery, and in the 1970s there were all sorts of types of speculation as to what they were, including that they might be a sort of "white hole" -- the other side of a black hole, where the mass and energy of a black hole was emitted into our universe.

We now know that quasars are actually supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. These celestial monsters are millions or even billions of times the mass of our sun. But not all supermassive black holes are quasars. To be a quasar, the black hole must be feeding -- consuming the gas and stars around it at a breathtaking pace. As that matter spirals down into oblivion, it heats up to outrageous temperatures and emits light. It's that light that we see, and why we know that there is a large black hole at the center of this distant galaxy.

The recent observation is the most distant quasar ever observed. It is powered by an enormous black hole, and it existed when the universe was in its infancy. And that is the source of the mystery. Just how is it possible for such a massive black hole to exist when the cosmos was so young?

Astronomers have a pretty good handle on the broad strokes of how the universe has evolved. It started about 13.7 billion years ago in an event called the Big Bang , when all of the matter of the visible universe was compressed into a tiny volume. For reasons that are still being worked out, it "exploded," for the lack of a better word, starting out very hot and cooling as it went. In a scant three minutes, the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up ordinary matter existed, although the universe was too hot for atoms to form. At a time about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for atomic hydrogen and helium to form. At that point, the universe "went dark." It was relatively cool, transparent to light, and was nearly a uniform cloud of hydrogen and helium gas.

That "nearly" is important, as there were very small fluctuations in the density of that gas, and the denser portions started to attract other nearby gas, setting into motion the events that led to the universe we see today.

As the gas concentrated, it grew hotter, eventually turning into stars and galaxies. The very first galaxies formed when the universe was about 180 million years old, just about 500 million years before the recently observed quasar existed.

Five hundred million years may seem like a long time to us, but cosmically speaking, it's merely the blink of an eye. The fact that this black hole grew in such a short time challenges our models of how early galaxies formed. Stars would have to be born, die, and become black holes that then accumulated in close proximity in the center of the galaxy.

After that, there needed to be a period in which the black holes devoured one another in a sort of immense orgy of cosmic cannibalism. We know that black holes do indeed merge, as we've recently been able to observe the phenomena, but it is hard to understand how the process happened so quickly, and how such an incredibly massive black hole could form so early in the history of the universe.

So what explanations have astronomers offered to explain this observation? One is that a large black hole formed and then consumed matter around it at a dizzying pace. The problem with this explanation is that, as matter spirals into the black hole, it heats up and forms a kind of pressure that pushes back on other matter falling into the hole. The more the black hole consumes, the hotter it gets and the more it pushes back. Thus, the process should sort of self-regulate, and it is hard to understand how the hole could consume so much mass so quickly and be so big so soon after the Big Bang.

Dark matter is thought to be A second and exciting possibility is that heavy black holes were made much earlier in the history of the universe than expected. This is because it is very hard to understand how many stellar-massed black holes could combine together so early in the universe.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/10/middleeast/mideast-tension-trump-jerusalem/index.htmlTurkey's Erdogan calls Israel a 'child-murderer' stateBeirut, Lebanon (CNN) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Israel a "terrorist" and "child-murderer state" in an address Sunday as he criticized President Donald Trump over his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

"Jerusalem is the apple of our eye. We will not abandon it to the child-murderer state. We will not abandon it to an occupier state," Erdogan said in an address in the Turkish city of Sivas.

"We will continue our struggle within law and democracy. In Istanbul we will unite Islamic countries, leaders and heads of states. Our road map will show that it will not be easy for them to realize their plans," Erdogan said. He also said Trump's Jerusalem announcement was "null and void."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Erdogan on Sunday, saying: "I'm not used to receiving lectures about morality from a leader who bombs Kurdish villagers in his native turkey, who jails journalists, who helps Iran go around international sanctions, and who helps terrorists, including in Gaza, kill innocent people. That is not the man who is going to lecture us."

Speaking from Paris, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, Netanyahu said that Jerusalem has "always been our capital, and Jerusalem has never been the capital of any other people. I think the sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we'll move towards peace."

Israel Defense Forces spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the tunnel, which originated in the city of Khan Younis, had penetrated several hundred meters inside Israeli territory, finishing a kilometer away from the nearest village in Israel.

Conricus described the tunnel as "very substantial," adding that it had communication systems, air vents, electricity and reinforced concrete structure. He said that, based on intelligence, the Israeli army believed the tunnel belonged to Hamas, the militant organization that runs Gaza.

Conricus said that Israeli intelligence had monitored the tunnel for months, adding that at no time were any Israeli military personnel or civilians at risk. While the tunnel was not yet complete, Conricus claimed Hamas was not far from establishing an exit point.

"We see this as a severe violation of Israeli sovereignty," Conricus told journalists in a phone call on Sunday.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/12/entertainment/arie-luyendyk-bachelor-special/index.htmlWhat we learned from 'The Bachelor' special(CNN) ABC is getting us ready for a new season of "The Bachelor."

Monday's "Countdown to Arie" was a prelude to Season 22 which premieres on January 1.

To possibly combat any confusion over the selection of race car driver Arie Luyendyk Jr., who last vied for the heart of Emily Maynard on "The Bachelorette" Season 8 in 2012, the audience was treated to plenty of info about him.

Here's some of what we learned:

Arie likes to smooch

At least he did with Maynard because there was plenty of making out.

Based on the clips from the new season -- and host Chris Harrison's break down of Arie's kissing styles -- we understand why he's been dubbed "the kissing bandit."

Fans on Twitter didn't seem to mind.

If we're being honest I could probably watch 2 hours straight of Arie kissing people with no conversation and be absolutely captivated #TheBachelor — Bachelor Chirps (@BachelorChirps) December 12, 2017

"If we're being honest I could probably watch 2 hours straight of Arie kissing people with no conversation and be absolutely captivated #TheBachelor," tweeted one viewer.

There's going to be drama

Because of course there is.

It is "The Bachelor" after all. Without romantic sagas, how could Harrison claim we were in store for "the most dramatic rose ceremony ever"?

In a preview clip, we learned that at least one of the new season's contestants has an ex with some regrets because he stormed in claiming, "I want my girl. I'm here to tell her that I want to marry her!"

There are four Lauren's

This one was more sleuthing than watching.

The headshots and bios are already live on ABC's site , and the new season will feature Lauren B., Lauren G., Lauren J. and Lauren S. all going for that rose.

How cool would it be if we ended up with Lauren vs. Lauren in the finale?

Fingers crossed, Bachelor Nation.0

Based on the available evidence, while fans fret about such things -- as a search of "Star Wars Saturation" reveals -- there's little to suggest that the Disney empire, which now presides over the franchise, has reason to lose any sleep.

The debate about Disney's grandiose plans for "Star Wars" began not long after the studio acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion. The company's blueprint included not only the new trilogy, of which "Last Jedi" is the second chapter, but stand-alone movies and spinoffs.

More recently, Disney announced that a new live-action series will help inaugurate its planned streaming service, pursuing the same strategy that CBS employed by making "Star Trek: Discovery" the centerpiece of its CBS All Access premium venture.

When the goal is inspiring people to cough up cash, sci-fi projects with "Star" in the title have been designated as pop culture's most reliable bets.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/11/entertainment/golden-globes-analysis/index.htmlGolden Globes: No crystal ball for murky Oscar race(CNN) Once considered an Oscar bellwether, the Golden Globe nominations announced Monday have done more to muddy than clarify an Academy Award race that appears extremely wide open, while highlighting the lingering tension between recognizing small films and the sort of popular blockbusters that would bring name recognition and possibly more viewers to the broadcast.

Presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, an organization with just 89 members, the Globes have long exhibited a preference for big-name stars and projects with European talent, and that has persisted. Yet the nominees unveiled -- coupled with early voting by critics groups, which has also conspicuously spread the wealth -- should leave those who try to use the Globes as a sort-of crystal ball stuck in suspense regarding the Oscar nominations, which will be announced on Jan. 23. (The Globes will be presented Jan. 7.)

A few smaller movies, including the coming-of-age tales "Lady Bird" and "Call Me By Your Name," have enjoyed acceptance from an array of groups, and both secured Globe bids. Yet due to a quirk of the group's categories -- which splits best picture into drama and musical or comedy -- they find themselves in different brackets, with "Lady Bird" somewhat questionable labeled a comedy, along with Jordan Peele's "Get Out."

"Get Out," which grossed $175 million at the U.S. box office, is also one of the few big money makers included, along with Christopher Nolan's World War II drama "Dunkirk." "Wonder Woman," meanwhile, was omitted.

Thank you to the HFPA and congratulations to all the nominees."

Plummer stepped into the role after the filmmakers decided to remove Spacey from the film entirely and reshoot the character's scenes again with a new actor, a costly and rare move for a motion picture.

The decision to do so came about six weeks before the film was set to hit theaters in late December.

For those seeking a yuletide movie-going alternative to awards bait and "Star Wars," this game-inspired offering is worth giving a spin.

"Jumanji" receives a videogame-informed upgrade from the 1995 movie that starred Robin Williams, which requires transacting a whole lot of business in the first 15 minutes to get the board set up.

Four high-school students -- two nerds, a popular girl and a jock -- all land in detention, where they discover the play console that yanks them into the peril-filled world of Jumanji.

There, the four each take the form of the avatar they chose when not realizing the stakes. One of the nerds thus becomes musclebound Dr. Smolder Bravestone (the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson), the other skilled fighter Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), the jock Bravestone's sidekick "Moose" Finbar (Kevin Hart), and the other girl scientist Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), owing to some confusion about the name.

The body-hopping aspect actually gives the cast material worth playing, even if it's extremely broad. In Johnson's case, that includes spoofing his own image -- as the kid revels in Bravestone's strength and physique -- while Gillan grouses about her wardrobe, Hart gripes about his diminutive size and, most obviously, Black vamps in playing a flighty girl confused by her new, er, accessories.

http://cnn.com/2017/12/10/entertainment/walking-dead-midseason-finale-review/index.html'Walking Dead' sets stage for key death(CNN) The following contains spoilers about the "The Walking Dead" midseason finale.

"The Walking Dead" has described this season as "All Out War," but it has often felt immersed in tactics, as if several episodes were simply setting up pieces on a chessboard. The midseason finale was largely guilty of the same right up until the last minute, which planted the seeds for the death of a major character.

The final sequence featured Rick (Andrew Lincoln) coming upon his son Carl (Chandler Riggs), who reveals that he had suffered a bite from one of the "walkers" -- a wound that's invariably fatal. Lest there be any doubt, on companion show "The Talking Dead" showrunner Scott M. Gimple -- who has been coy about such matters at times -- confirmed that the character had been bitten, and that it would play out as zombie bites had in the past.

Riggs is one of the few remaining original characters, and has virtually grown up on the AMC series. Yet leaving his actual death until the show returns after its customary winter break -- it's slated to return in February -- feels like another ploy to lure viewers back, if a less irritating one than some of the previous cliffhangers. (Although he's been accepted to college, Riggs told The Hollywood Reporter that leaving the show "wasn't my decision," but rather is intended to serve to the larger story.)

The strange moment came before a presidential bill signing ceremony in the morning. Events like that often include what's known as a "pool spray," a brief opportunity for a small group of reporters and photographers to take photos and, when possible, ask questions. The White House "pool" is comprised of a few members of the press corps who are assigned on a rotating basis to cover presidential events and file reports to be used by other media outlets when it would be impractical for the entire press corps to attend those events. When journalists are on pool duty, they are working not just on behalf of themselves and their employers but for all the journalists and outlets that receive pool reports.

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders gave CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who had drawn pool duty, an unusual warning.

Pose a question to Trump at the pool spray after the bill signing, Sanders told Acosta, and "I can't promise you will be allowed into a pool spray again."

Sanders did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Acosta said he was stunned by the interaction, which other pool reporters witnessed.

"I couldn't believe my ears," he said in an email. "She did not appear to be issuing the same warning to the other reporters in the pool."

Following the warning, Acosta said that Sanders asked if the two could speak off the record. Acosta declined and ultimately posed a question to Trump at the spray, asking the president about a suggestive tweet he directed at Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Trump did not respond.

Some of Acosta's colleagues in the White House press corps, like NBC News' Hallie Jackson, backed him after the event concluded.

"@POTUS doesn't have to answer questions," Jackson tweeted, "but we can sure ask them."

.@Acosta was at the bill signing as part of the rotating pool that reps all 5 tv networks. And to be clear: this is not how the pool works. @POTUS doesn't have to answer questions - but we can sure ask them. https://t.co/NmvLNlZn7Z — Hallie Jackson (@HallieJackson) December 12, 2017

In a statement, Margaret Talev, a senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg who is president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said, "It is longstanding practice for reporters to ask questions of the president during events like the one today, and it is at the president's discretion to decide whether and how to answer those questions. It is up to news organizations to determine which journalists they assign to represent them in the pool."

Acosta has been involved in some tense exchanges during White House press briefings with Sanders and her predecessor, Sean Spicer. And that tension in the briefing room has been emblematic of the administration's hostile relationship with CNN, as well as other outlets.

At Monday's briefing, after Sanders said news outlets "purposely" spread false information, Acosta pressed her for relevant examples. She was unable to come up with any. (She did cite an erroneous report by ABC News' Brian Ross regarding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's guilty plea, but there has been no evidence or suggestion that the false information in that report was spread "purposely," rather than being the result of an error.)

Trump himself appears to relish his attacks on CNN, perhaps even more so than any other news organization he goes after. After CNN issued a major correction last week on a story about an email Trump and his son had received regarding Wikileaks, the president taunted the outlet on Twitter.

"Fake news CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday...Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?" he said.-1

Cyclist had double allowed level of legal asthma drug

Governing body says it wants more details

(CNN) The world's best cyclist Chris Froome has asthma -- and he recently failed a drugs test in one of the sport's most prestigious races because of the condition.

Four-time Tour de France winner Froome, who rides for Team Sky, was found to have double the allowed level of the legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine on a test taken on September 7 during the Vuelta a España, which the 32-year-old went on to win.

In a statement, the sport's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), said the British rider was informed of an "Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF)" on September 20 and that an analysis of the B sample had confirmed the results of the rider's A sample.

Froome, Britain's most successful road cyclist, who won his fourth Tour de France in July, said: "It is well known that I have asthma and I know exactly what the rules are.

"I use an inhaler to manage my symptoms (always within the permissible limits) and I know for sure that I will be tested every day I wear the race leader's jersey.-1

Twice Nehlen dodged the question. The third time he didn’t respond.

The Wisconsin Republican is running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan, who might not be seeking re-election. Nehlen campaigned in Alabama recently for Roy Moore, the Senate nominee accused of sexual misconduct, who suffered a historic defeat Tuesday. Nehlen claims to have raised “six figures” for the Moore campaign.

Nehlen was a speaker Monday at Moore’s campaign rally in Midland City, Alabama. He took the stage wearing the red “Make America great again” cap and warned the crowd that “we’re engaged in a spiritual battle.” Moore was the only one, he said, who could “drain that swamp” up in D.C.

Only two days earlier, on Dec. 9, Nehlen was a guest on an anti-Semitic white power podcast called “Fash the Nation,” talking to hosts “Jazzhands McFeels” and “Marcus Halberstram” for about an hour. (“Fash” is shorthand among the so-called alt-right, a loose association of white nationalists, for “fascist.”)

Bill Clark via Getty Images Paul Nehlen, right, is introduced at a "Drain the Swamp" Roy Moore campaign event in Midland City, Alabama, on Monday.

It was Nehlen’s second appearance on the show, and his fluency with white nationalist jargon was evident as he made thinly veiled anti-Semitic remarks and proudly recounted having told a Jewish magazine editor to “eat a bullet.”

On Dec. 8, Nehlen used Gab, a micro-blogging platform used primarily by white nationalists, to repost a drawing another user had made for him. The drawing showed a puny Ryan, seen as the anti-Trump, next to a buff “Chad” Nehlen. (Chad is an alt-right term for a fit alpha-male womanizer.) In the accompanying text, Nehlen is described as having “redpilled on globalism, RR and JQ.”

“Redpilled,” a reference to the Matrix movie trilogy, is used to describe an awakening to white supremacist teachings. “RR” stands for “race realism,” and “JQ” stands for the “Jewish question,” the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews have undue influence over the media, banking and politics.

Gab

Earlier this month, Nehlen tweeted “It’s okay to be white,” a meme that originated on the message board 4chan, a haven for neo-Nazi trolls, and was spread enthusiastically by white nationalists. “In fact it’s pretty awesome,” he added in a follow-up tweet.

It's okay to be white. — Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) December 5, 2017

On at least two occasions this month, Nehlen has retweeted racist memes shared by Mark Collett, a British Nazi sympathizer.

Screenshot

On the night of Aug. 11, when neo-Nazis and other assorted racists marched with tiki torches through Charlottesville, Virginia, Nehlen retweeted an image of the march posted by white nationalist Jason Kessler: “Incredible moment for white people who’ve had it up to here & aren’t going to take it anymore. Tomorrow we #UnitetheRight #Charlottesville.”

After Moore’s defeat in Alabama, Nehlen shared another piece of fan art Wednesday that was created for him on Gab. It showed Roman centurions with “Pepe the Frog” heads. (Pepe the Frog is the mascot of the white nationalists.)

“I call on all ready and able #GabFam to run for #House and #Senate and to vote for fellow #GabFam like @pnehlen in 2018,” read the text.

Gab

HuffPost emailed Nehlen on Wednesday detailing some of these — and other — flirtations he’s made with being an avowed white nationalist. Asked if he considers himself either a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right, Nehlen largely dodged the question, sending the following statement:

I’m a successful businessman and have had something like 20,000 employees around the globe of every color, race, and creed; not to mention patented inventions so attempts to paint me as anything but a successful businessman reflect on the media’s identity politics not my Christian faith. Besides ― it’s true that it’s okay to be white ― it’s pretty awesome in fact.

Asked in a follow-up email to clarify whether or not he’s a white nationalist with a simple yes or no, Nehlen responded:

Given that the media is still determined to libel all conservatives as bigots, it seems some clarity on the definition of American Nationalism ― the idea that the United States should put the economic and security interests of American citizens ahead of the economic and security interests of illegal aliens and non-citizens ― is in order.

In a third email Thursday, HuffPost noted that this was a definition of nationalism, but that it didn’t answer the question as to whether Nehlen considers himself a white nationalist or a member of the alt-right.

He didn’t respond.

Nehlen’s association with the Moore campaign, which received funding from the Republican National Committee and was endorsed by President Donald Trump, shows that a faction of the GOP appears to be at ease with white nationalists in its ranks.

At the Moore campaign rally Monday he attended, Moore’s wife defended her husband from accusations of anti-Semitism by saying that one of his attorneys is a Jew. (An investigation by The Forward failed to find this Jewish lawyer.)

It also shows that Steve Bannon’s effort to publicly distance himself from the alt-right is a ruse. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive chairman and a former White House chief strategist, had championed Moore and is backing Nehlen.

Nehlen told HuffPost that Bannon is a “friend.” On the “Fash the Nation” podcast, Nehlen said Bannon considers him a “kamikaze” against the GOP establishment.

Bannon did not respond to a request for comment on Nehlen’s white nationalist sentiments. Neither did the Moore campaign. Nor did the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Nehlen has been comfortable expressing bigoted comments in public for a while now, as documented by the Angry White Men blog run by Twitter user @EyesOnTheRight.

Earlier this month, during a Twitter spat with Richard Lawler, an editor at tech news site Engadget who is black, Nehlen tweeted, “Run along Tyrone.”

Run along Tyrone. — Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) December 1, 2017

As @EyesOnTheRight wrote, “There are two ways to interpret that comment, both of which suggest Nehlen was making a racist remark. On the one hand, Nehlen used a stereotypically black name to refer to an African-American man whose name he clearly knew. On the other, ‘Tyrone’ is a reference to a racist joke popular on the alt-right.”

That “joke” features a deeply racist cartoon rendering of a black man, which we won’t republish here.

On the “Fash the Nation” podcast last weekend, Nehlen recounted another Twitter spat he’d had, this one with John Podhoretz, the conservative editor of Commentary magazine.

After an argument over gun control, Nehlen had tweeted to Podhoretz, who is Jewish, that he should “self-deport” and “eat a bullet.”

“So Bannon’s catamite @pnehlen has, in the past 12 hours, suggested I commit suicide and called on me, born and raised in the U.S. but Jewish, to ‘self-deport,’” Podhoretz tweeted.

“Catamite” is an obscure word referring to a young boy kept by a pederast. “What race even has that word?” Nehlen asked on “Fash the Nation.” “Well, there’s one.”

The hosts laughed. McFeels called it a “very biblical term,” emphasizing again Podheretz’s religious heritage.

“If people watch you stand in the face of the people like [the] John Podhoretzes of the world, the people who want to throw their parentheses at you — I have no time for that,” Nehlen said. “I’m not afraid of those guys.”

“Parentheses” is a reference to the anti-Semitic “echo” gimmick, in which the names of Jews or Jewish institutions are placed in triple parentheses.

Nehlen was suspended from Twitter for 12 hours for telling Podhoretz to “eat a bullet.” He told the “Fash the Nation” hosts that he “got shoah’d for 12 hours.”

“Shoah” is Jewish word for “calamity,” used most commonly to refer to the Holocaust. For white nationalists, though, it’s used as a slur, reserved for small inconveniences — like getting suspended by Twitter — as a way of diminishing the horror of the Holocaust.

Nehlen also bragged that his fans had listened to his first appearance on “Fash the Nation” and that the “the redpills are being shot at people like with bump fire stocks.” (Translation: He’s converting a lot of his supporters into white nationalists.)

At another point, Nehlen and the hosts talked gushingly about a recent stunt by the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, whose members joined the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville this summer.

In March, Identity Evropa hung a giant banner from a highway overpass in Georgia that read “America first. End immigration now.” The group tweeted out a photo, which Nehlen retweeted.

The “Fash the Nation” hosts were deeply flattered that Nehlen was a guest on their show. McFeels — who, it should be noted, has appeared on the radio show of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, and has called for the creation of a “white ethno-state” — lashed out at Paul Ryan for taking money from Jewish “paymasters” and promised to “make sure” Nehlen wins his congressional race in Wisconsin. Nehlen replied that he was “honored” to be on the show.-1

But without an alleged child predator like Republican Roy Moore on the ticket in 2020, Jones will almost certainly have an uphill climb to re-election.

Still, the national progressive groups that raised money for Jones and marshaled volunteers on his behalf insist that his best route to a second term is to embrace populist policies and stick to core liberal convictions, rather than blazing the kind of cautious, moderate path more typical of red-state Democrats.

“The best way for Doug Jones to hold the seat is to legislate as a bold populist to fight for kitchen-table issues, fight for more money in people’s pockets,” said Kaitlin Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which raised about $40,000 for Jones. “We could see him be a leader in issues that transcend partisan politics ― expanding health care to every American, making education funding fair, ensuring a living wage ― issues that could resonate with Democratic voters in Selma and Republican voters in Mobile.”

At the same time, Sweeney added, “Nobody is expecting him to come in and govern like a Jeff Merkley [D-Ore.] or an Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.].”

But progressive leaders fear that Jones will instead heed the emerging chorus of pundits counseling him to emulate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other red-state Democratic lawmakers, whose conservatism ― even on economic policy ― is a sore point on the left.

Jones “should not follow the advice of D.C. insiders who tell him that he should be doing the bidding of corporations, telling him that he should be trying to find the middle ground, that he should be a Republican-lite or even worse a racist-lite,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, which raised $75,000 for Jones and mobilized its 12,000 Alabamian members to phone-bank and canvass for Jones. “He needs to fight for inclusive populist policies.”

Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images Senator-elect Doug Jones (D-Ala.) speaks to reporters on Dec. 13, 2017, the day after his upset victory in a special election for an open U.S. Senate seat.

At its core, these organizations’ advice for Jones, while self-validating, gets to the heart of a debate about how Democrats can win in challenging territory. Many in the party’s left wing have long maintained that a focus on delivering tangible economic benefits will both excite base voters and win over independents and Republicans in the most conservative areas. The 2016 loss of Hillary Clinton, who struggled at times to craft a compelling economic narrative and dispel perceptions of undue coziness with financial elites, has only made them more confident in their argument.

“Yes, a Democrat winning in Alabama is an anomaly in current modern, political speak,” Chamberlain said. “But that’s the reality only because Democrats continually don’t run on their values, they continually don’t run on inclusive populist ideas that are universally popular, accepted and actually impact everyone including Republicans.”

DFA pointed to a 2014 poll it commissioned with PCCC and other groups showing majority support for expanding Social Security in solidly Republican Texas and Kentucky.

“I am confident that Republicans in Alabama are no different,” Chamberlain said.

And even if Jones does not buy an electoral pitch for populism, Chamberlain added, he would do well to embrace the moral urgency of the moment ― come what may at the ballot box.

“The bottom line is that we’re in a situation right now where we are fighting the most corrupt, corporate president in the history of America who is willing to do anything, say anything to divide the country in as many ways as he possibly can,” Chamberlain said. “With that lens on it, if I were Doug Jones, I might very possibly say, ‘This is my YOLO moment. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to deliver the highest amount of change as possible in my limited time in Congress.’”

Some policies where DFA, PCCC and their allies believe Jones has the best chance of pushing a progressive agenda with crossover appeal are expanding Social Security, raising the minimum wage, protecting voting rights ― and even expanding public health care.

Rather than embrace single-payer health care ― or “Medicare for all,” as progressives have dubbed it ― Sweeney suggested that Jones could advocate a Medicare buy-in for the entire population.

“Medicare is one of those programs that’s popular all across the country, including red states like Alabama,” she said. “A way to bring people along on Medicare for all is allow people to buy into the program and see what it’s like.”

The way Jones ― best known for his work as a U.S. attorney convicting the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the deadly 1963 bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, church ― ran his campaign has given liberals reason for optimism.

Jones pleased many observers by eschewing the social conservatism that characterized white Southern Democrats of previous decades. He is a strong supporter of abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, criminal justice reform and policies to limit climate change, which he acknowledges is a grave, man-made threat.

Jones also describes health care as a “right,” backing “improvement” of the Affordable Care Act over repeal. He has said he is open to the possibility of a “public option” for health insurance that might resemble the Medicare buy-in mentioned by PCCC.

In his victory speech Tuesday night, Jones called on Congress to immediately renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to low- and moderate-income kids who don’t qualify for Medicaid. (Sixteen states are due to run out of the funds needed to keep the program running by the end of January, if Congress fails to act.)

But Jones is already on the brink of disappointing activists who want him to wade into last-minute attempts to thwart the Republican tax bill.

Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo Mobile, a progressive phone company with an online network of 5 million activists, asked Jones to join Democratic leaders in calling for the GOP to delay a vote on the massive tax bill until Jones is seated in the Senate.

“This is his first test,” Zaheed said. “He needs to speak out now. That’s gonna tell us a lot about how he is going to represent Alabamians over the next three years.”

Thus far, Jones has shown no such willingness to speak out on the matter. Referring to the timing of when he is seated in the Senate, Jones told the popular liberal podcast “Pod Save America” that “we’ve still got a process in Alabama that we have to go though.”

And Jones appears most comfortable speaking about his desire to project a more sophisticated view of lawmakers from the Deep South by dint of his liberal stances on social issues and openness to bipartisan cooperation.

“Unfortunately, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions’s voice is what people think of when they think of the typical Southern politician,” Jones told The Washington Post. “And that’s not true at all. I want to have the bully pulpit to challenge those views in public all the time.”

At the same time, Jones told the Post that he won based on a focus on “kitchen table” economic issues.

There is indeed some evidence to support this idea. In addition to sending some 100,000 text messages to nudge moderate-propensity Democrats to turn out for Jones, the Working Families Party tested about 25 digital ads in more conservative rural counties outside the city of Huntsville in northern Alabama.

The ads that elicited the most interest from voters, according to WFP spokesman Joe Dinkin, framed the election as a choice between two sharply divergent economic visions. “Roy Moore wants to take away your health care while cutting taxes for billionaires,” one of the successful digital ads declared.

Working Families Party

Governing as an advocate for a higher minimum wage and greater health care access is likely to have crossover appeal for the same reason, Dinkin posited.0

Adam Schiff Warns Of GOP Plans To Shutter House's Russia ProbeRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee may be looking to prematurely shutter the committee’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a ranking Democrat warned Friday.

In a series of tweets, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) explained why he was becoming “increasingly worried” that the probe may be nearing a conclusion as soon as the end of December.

I’m increasingly worried Republicans will shut down the House Intelligence Committee investigation at the end of the month.



Here’s why: — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

Schiff, who is working on the probe, said that Republicans on the committee have not issued any subpoenas or scheduled any further witness interviews past next Friday. The inaction, he added, comes at a time when the panel has made “important progress” in the nine months of the investigation, which has involved interviewing key witnesses and uncovering new leads.

“We have dozens of outstanding witnesses on key aspects of our investigation that they refuse to contact and many document requests they continue to sit on,” Schiff wrote.

“It appears Republicans want to conduct just enough interviews to give the impression of a serious investigation,” he added.

Since March, our investigation has made important progress. We’ve interviewed numerous key witnesses behind closed doors, held public hearings, reviewed thousands of documents, identified new leads — all to understand and expose Russia's meddling and protect our democracy. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

Yet, Republicans have scheduled no witnesses after next Friday and none in 2017. We have dozens of outstanding witnesses on key aspects of our investigation that they refuse to contact and many document requests they continue to sit on. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

It appears Republicans want to conduct just enough interviews to give the impression of a serious investigation. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

Schiff’s warning mirrors a report from The New York Times published Friday suggesting that the House Intelligence Committee is rushing to finish the investigation before Congress breaks for the holidays.

According to the Times report, some of the panel’s most important witnesses will be interviewed in New York next week, potentially forcing some House Democrats to choose between voting on the GOP’s controversial tax bill and attending depositions for the Russian investigation. Schiff said the witnesses were willing to travel to the capital.

In his tweets, Schiff added that the House will also have to vote on “vital government funding bills” as well. The time crunch could mean that “no Members will be able to ask questions,” he wrote.

All this, Schiff said, would be “in an effort to squeeze them in before end of year.”

Asked about the push to end the investigation, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who is leading the House probe on Russia, told The New York Times, “I feel no need to apologize for concluding an investigation.”

Next week, they scheduled critical witness interviews out of state, when we are voting on the tax bill and vital government funding bills and no Members will be able to ask questions, in an effort to squeeze them in before end of year.



These witnesses are willing to come to DC. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

Despite our repeated urging, Majority has declined to issue subpoenas in numerous avenues of the investigation, where there's simply no other way to get the information. Some refusals we’ve made public, like witnesses hiding behind nonexistent privileges, many others we haven’t. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

The responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation, or to prevent one, ultimately falls on @SpeakerRyan. I’m concerned he's heeding the calls of Bannon and @POTUS to “DO SOMETHING” by closing down the Russia investigation & opening up another investigation of Hilary Clinton. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017

Schiff also pointed to recent “attacks” by Republicans on special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI as evidence that the GOP politicians were working to end the Russia investigation “aggressively and soon.”

Republicans have taken aim at Mueller’s investigation into Russia this week after reports revealed that the FBI removed Peter Strzok, a top agent, from the probe. Strzok was found sending text messages that could be seen as critical of President Donald Trump.

During an oversight hearing of the House Judiciary Committee earlier this week, Republicans suggested that the public could no longer trust Mueller and the Justice Department to conduct an unbiased investigation, according to NBC News.

“I think the public trust in this whole thing is gone,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Wednesday.

Similarly, Trump cast doubt on the FBI’s efficacy earlier this month when he tweeted that the bureau’s reputation was “in tatters” and “the worst in history” under former director James Comey.

On Friday, the president told reporters that “people are very, very angry” with the FBI and the Justice Department ahead of his trip to the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia.

In his tweets, Schiff warned the public that attacks on the Justice Department by Republicans and the White House are simply attempts to derail the Russia probe.

“We cannot let that happen,” the Democrat said.

Beyond our investigation, here’s what has me really concerned: The attacks on Mueller, DOJ and FBI this week make it clear they plan to go after Mueller’s investigation.



Aggressively and soon. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) December 15, 2017-1

It's inspired by former BBC show 'Come Dancing', and shares its name with 1992 film 'Strictly Ballroom'. Being one of the most popular shows on TV, it goes head-to-head with ITV's 'The X Factor' from September to December every year on Saturday and Sunday nights. It was originally hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, but Claudia Winkleman has taken over from the veteran entertainer since he stepped down in 2014. The current judges are Craig Revel-Horwood, Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli and Shirley Ballas, who has replaced Len Goodman as Head Judge. Alesha Dixon and Arlene Phillips have both previously sat on the panel. The show is now its 15th series, with the 2017 line-up made up of Alexandra Burke, Aston Merrygold, Brian Conley, Charlotte Hawkins, Chizzy Akudolu, Davood Ghadami, Debbie McGee, Gemma Atkinson, Joe McFadden, Jonnie Peacock, Mollie King, Richard Coles, Ruth Langsford, Simon Rimmer and Susan Calman. Last year's competition won by BBC sports presenter Ore Oduba and his partner Joanne Clifton, who followed in the footsteps of previous winners like Jay McGuiness, Caroline Flack, Louis Smith, Alesha Dixon, Harry Judd and Abbey Clancy. The 2017 series saw the departure of professional dancers Natalie Lowe, Joanne Clifton and Oksana Platero who all quit the show. Among the current line-up are Brendan Cole, Anton DuBeke, Kevin and Karen Clifton and Pasha Kovalev and Oti Mabuse.0

The class of 2017 have made this run the most watched in its history, with over 11 million tuning into each episode - a rare feat in TV land, as how many other long-running shows can say they are more popular now than when they began 13 years ago?

Viewers have been completely enthralled and enchanted with Strictly’s magical mix of dance, sequins and campery, and the series has found a deserving champion in Joe McFadden.

The former ‘Holby City’ actor has certainly had the biggest journey of all the finalists, given he had little prior dance experience compared to Debbie and Alexandra.

That said, a victory for Alexandra would have been extra sweet given she was arguably the most talented dancer. It also would have been a victory over the trolls and certain sectors of the press who tried to drag her down during her time on the show.

I guess we will just have to settle for a long-awaited third album from her instead.0

But Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are not the only ones marrying on May 19 next year. Three couples tell HuffPost UK how they really feel about sharing the best day of their lives with royalty. Julie Khan, a senior designer, and Scott Bodie, a digital brand manager, both 31

Julie Khan Julie Khan and Scott are both 31 years old

How did you meet? We’ve known each other from our local area since we were 17 but met again at 24, our train was cancelled so we went for a drink, call it fate but we bumped into each other twice more that week and the rest was history. Where are you getting married and what are you most looking forward to about your wedding? We are getting married in the stunning Barbican Conservatory, London. For us, being surrounded by our friends and family is very important, sharing our day with those we care about means a lot. We love a good party too, so a fair amount of time will be spent on the dancefloor. Julie is also excited for our guests to see the venue and create some fantastic memories and pictures in what they call ‘The Concrete Jungle’. How do you feel about the Royal Wedding? It brings a nice atmosphere to the UK, people get excited and now America will be able to join in on the build up. At Will and Kate’s wedding, there were many celebrations and a fun atmosphere in London, we both attended a street party on their wedding day when we first started dating actually.​ How do you feel about having a wedding on the same day? I think logistically if it was in London I would be concerned due to road closures and our wedding being so central, but to honest I’m more upset I won’t be able to join in on the celebrations that may take place. Has it changed anything for you?

The only things are positive, it now means the media will join us in the countdown to our wedding day. Kyle Charnley and Katherine Dixon, both 30-year-old nurses

Katherine Dixon Kyle Charnley and Katherine Dixon, 30, are both nurses

How did you meet? We met whilst working as nurses. Katherine says the best thing about marrying Kyle is that he gives so much unconditional love, encouragement and support. We’re a team. Plus, we’ve got the whole ‘in sickness and in health’ thing down pretty well. Where are you getting married? Not quite the drama of Westminster Abbey, but the humble, crumbling Crowland Abbey in Peterborough will be our undoubtedly charming location. Founded in the eighth century, it certainly doesn’t lack character. What are you most looking forward to about your wedding? That moment when Katherine has just walked down the aisle and we turn to each other all nervous and excited. Getting to say our vows in front of all our family and friends. Oh, and the cake of course. What are your feelings about the royal wedding? Prince Harry and Meghan seem very much in love. We are very happy for them. Isn’t it great that they will share their royal wedding with the public too? The public adore a good love story to lift spirits. How do you feel about having yours on the same day? Ha, ha, we don’t blame them. The 19th of May is a very good date for a wedding. Spring is such a wonderful season to get married in. Neither too hot nor cold, such perfect photo posing temperature. Has it changed anything for you? Katherine will now have to record it! But seriously, no it doesn’t change anything for us. We will certainly get wedding fever on the 19th of May, which will in no doubt be, for our very own right royal day.

“I asked her why she didn’t like her curls,” Humes shared on Instagram on 13 December.

Using a system called machine learning, Christopher Shallue a senior software engineer at Google AI was able to effectively teach a computer to look through the vast amounts of data collected by NASA’s Kepler space telescope and then identify a planet. In this instance the computer was able to discover a brand-new planet called Kepler-90i. This increased the number of known planets in the Kepler 90 system to eight bringing it level only to our own solar system for having the most number of known planets.

NASA

The discovery confirms that sadly, our solar system is not as unique as we think and that stars are more than capable of supporting large numbers of planets. Andrew Vanderburg, astronomer and NASA Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Texas, Austin believes that this could in fact just be the start for finding more planets in the Kepler 90 system. “It’s very possible that Kepler-90 has even more planets that we just don’t know about.” he explained. “In fact it would be surprising if there weren’t anymore planets.” NASA believes that Kepler-90i is a smallish rocky planet that orbits its host star in just 14.4 days.

Unfortunately it’s not a planet you would want to visit either with temperatures reaching a scorching 800-degrees on the surface. What’s really incredible about Kepler-90 as a system though is how all its planets are aligned with the star. “The Kepler-90 star system is like a mini version of our solar system. You have small planets inside and big planets outside, but everything is scrunched in much closer,” said Vanderburg, a NASA Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow and astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin. How does Kepler discover new planets? Despite being one of the most advanced pieces of equipment in space, Kepler’s ability to discover new planets stems from a remarkably simple trick. When we look towards a star system we have the potential to glimpse something known as a transit. This is when any planet orbiting the star passes in front of it from our point of view.

By constantly monitoring a region of space every few hours, Kepler is able to detect the minuscule drop in light from a single star as a planet passes in front of it. What’s perhaps even more remarkable is that just by looking at this data scientists can determine its size, distance from the star and even some basic information about its composition and atmosphere. Kepler has been so successful at capturing these transits that many of the new discoveries we’ve made by trawling through the vast quantities of data that Kepler has captured in the past. How did Google’s AI discover a new planet? Well as mentioned above we know that we can find planets by looking at dips of light coming from stars. Unfortunately for humans Kepler has looked at over 200,000 stars which means there is a frankly staggering amount of information to sort through. As such humans can only process so much information which meant that more often than not our planetary discoveries were made only by looking at the most visible dips of light. Shallue realised that much in the same way that he could teach a computer to learn the difference between cats and dogs he could teach it to notice the difference between something that wasn’t a planet and something that was. “In my spare time, I started googling for ‘finding exoplanets with large data sets’ and found out about the Kepler mission and the huge data set available,” said Shallue. “Machine learning really shines in situations where there is so much data that humans can’t search it for themselves.”1

An analysis of 10,000 children born in the UK, which is part of the Millennium Cohort Study, found that one in six parents allow their kids to drink booze by the time they turn 14.

The researchers, from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the UCL Institute of Education and Pennsylvania State University, found that “well-educated parents of white children” were most likely to allow their children to drink at 14.

Some parents may believe that exposing their kids to alcohol will help them develop a healthy attitude to drinking, but the study’s lead author, Jennifer Maggs, advised against this.

“Parents of socially-advantaged children may believe that allowing children to drink will teach them responsible use or may in fact inoculate them against dangerous drinking... they appear to view alcohol use as less risky,” said Maggs.

“However, there is little research to support these ideas.”0

The 29-year-old pedestrian, who was Polish but had been staying in Wandsworth, south London, was hit by a lorry as she used a pedestrian crossing while the traffic lights were green.

It is thought she was then struck by another lorry and up to three cars, and officers said none of the drivers stopped at the scene in Tulse Hill, also south London, on Monday morning.

A 49-year-old man who was driving the first lorry was interviewed under caution earlier this week while a 52-year-old driver of the second car was released under investigation following his arrest on Tuesday evening on suspicion of causing death by careless driving.

The driver of the first car and second lorry have now also been traced and spoken to, as has the driver of a third car which police believe may also have struck the woman.

None of these three people – for whom the police did not give ages or genders – have been arrested.

CCTV released earlier by police showed a white lorry and a black car which are thought to be the second and third vehicles involved in the collision.

Scotland Yard said further analysis of footage established that a third car may also have hit the woman, whose family arrived in London on Friday to formally identify her.

A post-mortem examination revealed her provisional cause of death was multiple injuries.

Despite tracing the five drivers, officers are continuing to appeal for information from witnesses, the Press Association reported.

Acting Detective Sergeant Alastair Middleton said: “Even though we have traced all the vehicles that we believe were involved, I continue to appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision and the moments afterwards to contact us immediately.

“We want to hear from anyone who travelled from the South Circular junctions of Norwood Road going towards the junction of Brixton Hill between the hours of 6.30am and 7am on the day of the collision.

“We are particularly interested in any dashcam footage that may have captured some of the incident before or after the collision.”

But without an alleged child predator like Republican Roy Moore on the ticket in 2020, Jones will almost certainly have an uphill climb to re-election.

Still, the national progressive groups that raised money for Jones and marshaled volunteers on his behalf insist that his best route to a second term is to embrace populist policies and stick to core liberal convictions, rather than blazing the kind of cautious, moderate path more typical of red-state Democrats.

“The best way for Doug Jones to hold the seat is to legislate as a bold populist to fight for kitchen-table issues, fight for more money in people’s pockets,” said Kaitlin Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which raised about $40,000 for Jones. “We could see him be a leader in issues that transcend partisan politics ― expanding health care to every American, making education funding fair, ensuring a living wage ― issues that could resonate with Democratic voters in Selma and Republican voters in Mobile.”

At the same time, Sweeney added, “Nobody is expecting him to come in and govern like a Jeff Merkley [D-Ore.] or an Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.].”

But progressive leaders fear that Jones will instead heed the emerging chorus of pundits counseling him to emulate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other red-state Democratic lawmakers, whose conservatism ― even on economic policy ― is a sore point on the left.

Jones “should not follow the advice of D.C. insiders who tell him that he should be doing the bidding of corporations, telling him that he should be trying to find the middle ground, that he should be a Republican-lite or even worse a racist-lite,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, which raised $75,000 for Jones and mobilized its 12,000 Alabamian members to phone-bank and canvass for Jones. “He needs to fight for inclusive populist policies.”

Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images Senator-elect Doug Jones (D-Ala.) speaks to reporters on Dec. 13, 2017, the day after his upset victory in a special election for an open U.S. Senate seat.

At its core, these organizations’ advice for Jones, while self-validating, gets to the heart of a debate about how Democrats can win in challenging territory. Many in the party’s left wing have long maintained that a focus on delivering tangible economic benefits will both excite base voters and win over independents and Republicans in the most conservative areas. The 2016 loss of Hillary Clinton, who struggled at times to craft a compelling economic narrative and dispel perceptions of undue coziness with financial elites, has only made them more confident in their argument.

“Yes, a Democrat winning in Alabama is an anomaly in current modern, political speak,” Chamberlain said. “But that’s the reality only because Democrats continually don’t run on their values, they continually don’t run on inclusive populist ideas that are universally popular, accepted and actually impact everyone including Republicans.”

DFA pointed to a 2014 poll it commissioned with PCCC and other groups showing majority support for expanding Social Security in solidly Republican Texas and Kentucky.

“I am confident that Republicans in Alabama are no different,” Chamberlain said.

And even if Jones does not buy an electoral pitch for populism, Chamberlain added, he would do well to embrace the moral urgency of the moment ― come what may at the ballot box.

“The bottom line is that we’re in a situation right now where we are fighting the most corrupt, corporate president in the history of America who is willing to do anything, say anything to divide the country in as many ways as he possibly can,” Chamberlain said. “With that lens on it, if I were Doug Jones, I might very possibly say, ‘This is my YOLO moment. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to deliver the highest amount of change as possible in my limited time in Congress.’”

Some policies where DFA, PCCC and their allies believe Jones has the best chance of pushing a progressive agenda with crossover appeal are expanding Social Security, raising the minimum wage, protecting voting rights ― and even expanding public health care.

Rather than embrace single-payer health care ― or “Medicare for all,” as progressives have dubbed it ― Sweeney suggested that Jones could advocate a Medicare buy-in for the entire population.

“Medicare is one of those programs that’s popular all across the country, including red states like Alabama,” she said. “A way to bring people along on Medicare for all is allow people to buy into the program and see what it’s like.”

The way Jones ― best known for his work as a U.S. attorney convicting the Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the deadly 1963 bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, church ― ran his campaign has given liberals reason for optimism.

Jones pleased many observers by eschewing the social conservatism that characterized white Southern Democrats of previous decades. He is a strong supporter of abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, criminal justice reform and policies to limit climate change, which he acknowledges is a grave, man-made threat.

Jones also describes health care as a “right,” backing “improvement” of the Affordable Care Act over repeal. He has said he is open to the possibility of a “public option” for health insurance that might resemble the Medicare buy-in mentioned by PCCC.

In his victory speech Tuesday night, Jones called on Congress to immediately renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to low- and moderate-income kids who don’t qualify for Medicaid. (Sixteen states are due to run out of the funds needed to keep the program running by the end of January, if Congress fails to act.)

But Jones is already on the brink of disappointing activists who want him to wade into last-minute attempts to thwart the Republican tax bill.

Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo Mobile, a progressive phone company with an online network of 5 million activists, asked Jones to join Democratic leaders in calling for the GOP to delay a vote on the massive tax bill until Jones is seated in the Senate.

“This is his first test,” Zaheed said. “He needs to speak out now. That’s gonna tell us a lot about how he is going to represent Alabamians over the next three years.”

Thus far, Jones has shown no such willingness to speak out on the matter. Referring to the timing of when he is seated in the Senate, Jones told the popular liberal podcast “Pod Save America” that “we’ve still got a process in Alabama that we have to go though.”

And Jones appears most comfortable speaking about his desire to project a more sophisticated view of lawmakers from the Deep South by dint of his liberal stances on social issues and openness to bipartisan cooperation.

“Unfortunately, [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions’s voice is what people think of when they think of the typical Southern politician,” Jones told The Washington Post. “And that’s not true at all. I want to have the bully pulpit to challenge those views in public all the time.”

At the same time, Jones told the Post that he won based on a focus on “kitchen table” economic issues.

There is indeed some evidence to support this idea. In addition to sending some 100,000 text messages to nudge moderate-propensity Democrats to turn out for Jones, the Working Families Party tested about 25 digital ads in more conservative rural counties outside the city of Huntsville in northern Alabama.

The ads that elicited the most interest from voters, according to WFP spokesman Joe Dinkin, framed the election as a choice between two sharply divergent economic visions. “Roy Moore wants to take away your health care while cutting taxes for billionaires,” one of the successful digital ads declared.

Governing as an advocate for a higher minimum wage and greater health care access is likely to have crossover appeal for the same reason, Dinkin posited.0

Her student? Matt Damon.

Damon raised more than a few eyebrows this week when he suggested that sexual harassment and sexual assault “shouldn’t be conflated,” then gave examples of how he and others should handle different levels of sexual misbehavior in an ABC News interview.

“I do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior,” Damon said in the interview. “And we’re going to have to figure out — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right?”

“It’s the micro that makes the macro,” Milano wrote in a tweet addressed to the Oscar-winning actor.

“We are in a ‘culture of outrage’ because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous,” she added. “And it is righteous.”

Dear Matt Damon,

We are in a “culture of outrage” because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017

Milano helped get the #MeToo movement trending on social media in October after film mogul Harvey Weinstein was publicly accused of being a serial sexual abuser.

Sharing the #MeToo hashtag would help show the world how common sexual assault and harassment are, the actress said at the time. “We might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem,” she tweeted.

Now directing her attention to Damon, Milano shared that she has been a victim of sexual harassment, assault and all notches across the spectrum Damon had suggested.

“They all hurt,” Milano tweeted Friday night. “And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted ― even welcomed ― misogyny.”

She then expressed the deeper reasons why survivors of assault and harassment are so incensed over the entire spectrum of sexual misconduct: They have long been “gaslighted” and “silenced.”

“We are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal,” Milano wrote. “We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long.”

I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted--even welcomed-- misogyny. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017

Milano likened Damon’s so-called spectrum of misconduct to the different stages of cancer. Though some stages of cancer are more treatable than others, they’re all cancer, Milano explained.

The tumor, however, is now being cut out, she concluded.

“Sexual harassment, misconduct, assault and violence is a systemic disease,” Milano wrote. “The tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers.”

Dogs aiding people with disabilities need to be comfortable around other types of animals and remain calm in the face of distraction. D-O-G is apparently the perfect candidate for testing their patience and can be seen in the video below batting at a dog’s tail and playing with a dog’s leash.

“He rules the roost,” CEO Anne Klein told ABC News last month. “He is the boss.”

Now a certified internet star, D-O-G has come a long way from his former life as a barn kitten. Nadine Wenig, director of canine services at Support Dogs, Inc., met the friendly kitten over the summer at a bed and breakfast and was “instantly smitten,” according to This Dog’s Life. The owners of the business ended up giving her the kitten, and she brought him back to the nonprofit’s center, where staff cautiously introduced him to the resident dogs.

“We saw that he was completely fearless despite his size and had no issue being around and close to the dogs,” volunteer manager Stephanie McCreary told This Dog’s Life.

Support Dogs, Inc. CEO Anne Klein told People Pets back in September that the office is pretty cushy for D-O-G, who has a multi-level cat condo to himself and is doted on by staff.2

The stories have spanned coastlines. Former super-producer Harvey Weinstein is said to have raped, assaulted and harassed dozens of women in the entertainment industry. Some 300 women say director James Toback has done things like masturbate in front of them without consent. Former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) reportedly encouraged a woman to touch his groin. The accused stand in depressingly good company: Kevin Spacey, Al Franken, Glenn Thrush, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, Ed Westwick, Danny Masterson, Mario Batali and more.

Shortly after “King of Comedy” Louie C.K. joined their ranks for masturbating in front of women without their consent, writer Ashley Simon hatched an idea that would become the common-decency instruction manual Where Does Your Penis Belong?, a primer for men that was released this week.

“Do we need to go back to 101 behavior here?” Simon jokingly wondered over dinner with friends, who later encouraged the project. She was also spurred on by victim-blaming responses to the women who shared their experiences.

“I was grossed out by the insinuation that women should know not to go into these hotel rooms, as if it’s on you to know that someone’s going to expose themselves without your consent and in a professional situation,” Simon told HuffPost.

In the book, priced at $24.99, a series of prompts allows readers to absorb a message through repetition: Whether it be in the office or on the train, one’s penis should stay in one’s pants.

Profits will be donated to RAINN, the sexual violence prevention organization.

Billed as “A Children’s Book for Grown-Ass Men,” the collaborative project from Simon, illustrator Allison Gore and web designer Isla Murray is available through Blurb, the self-publishing platform. Response has been enthusiastic, Simon said, with about 100 copies sold in the first few hours of the book’s release and a stream of supportive tweets.

A website for Where Does Your Penis Belong? explains that the book had been “a therapeutic exercise” for the three women, who felt “a desperate need for some comedic relief in the wake of so much trauma and outrage.”

At the bottom of the site, visitors can even input Twitter handles of men they believe might benefit from the educational message contained in Where Does Your Penis Belong? A tweet including a link to the book is then sent to the men anonymously.0

Juanita Fitzgerald spent her 94th birthday on Friday in a motel room, The Orlando Sentinel reports. The day before, she had been released from Florida’s Lake County Jail, which is where police took her after she was evicted from her home at the National Church Residences’ Franklin House in Eustis. The facility accused her of refusing to leave.

Clad in an orange jumpsuit, Fitzgerald told WFTV reporters earlier this week that she did not understand why she was being evicted.

Bodycam footage from the arrest showed her screaming and sliding to the ground in an apparent attempt to avoid being taken away. A police report obtained by The Miami Herald noted that Fitzgerald had told officers, “Unless you carry me out of here, I’m not going anywhere.”

Franklin House spokeswoman Karen Twinem told the Sentinel that Fitzgerald was evicted “based on her refusal to pay rent” and that the complex had been trying to work with Fitzgerald “for months” to “get her to agree to get more help so she could live in a situation that was more suitable.”

Fitzgerald countered that she had previously attempted to pay rent that the facility rejected, though Twinem has said Fitzgerald only presented a partial rent payment.

While some headlines described Fitzgerald as being “handcuffed,” the police report stated that she was transported to jail without handcuffs because of her age. However, on Friday the senior citizen showed the Sentinel bruises and scratches on her ankles that she said were from prison shackles. A jail spokeswoman told the site that it was typical for inmates to wear restraints, but could not confirm anything specifically about Fitzgerald’s case.-1

It kicked off with the inauguration of President Donald Trump, a man who was elected despite being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and misconduct. In response, millions of people took to the streets the following day for the Women’s March in cities worldwide. As the year unfolded, large numbers of women indicated interest in running for office. And the final months have been marked by dozens of women courageously coming forward to call out sexual abuse by powerful men.

This year of activation around women’s rights was reflected not only in our national politics and media, but in our social media feeds. Facebook’s 2017 Year in Review, which looks at the topics generating the most interest on the social media platform, found that the most talked-about moment of 2017 was International Women’s Day.

This year, International Women’s Day ― which people around the world celebrate each March 8 ― was marked by notable activism in the United States, with the “Day Without A Woman” strike rallying thousands in cities from New York to Alaska in the name of social justice.

What’s more, Facebook’s Year in Review found the most “attended” event on its platform this year ― among events that people actually attended in person ― was the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., with more than 500,000 people marking themselves as “interested” or “attending” the event on Facebook.

The second and third most talked-about moments of the year according to Facebook were the Super Bowl and the Las Vegas mass shooting.

To measure the most discussed topics, Facebook looked at the number of times that keywords were used in its users’ posts or status updates, data communications research manager Sheida Neman told HuffPost.

It’s worth noting that unlike previous Year in Review rankings, this year’s rankings didn’t consider the cumulative discussion of topics over the whole year, but rather those most talked about on a single day. To select its top “moments,” the site first looked at data from Jan. 1 to Nov. 1, 2017, to determine the moments with the highest volume of keywords on any single day, and then among those, selected the ones that saw high increases from last year to this year.1

You were wrong.

If you're the sort of person who reads only the first line because you have a short attention span, that's it. That's all you need to know. If you didn't like the changes which the national selectors made to the Australian line-up ahead of the first Ashes Test against England at The Gabba (which Australia just won by ten wickets), then you were wrong.

And Australia's selectors were right.

Two much-loved sports dominate the Australian summer cultural landscape. One is cricket. The other is selector bashing -- a rudimentary, bare-knuckled form of brutality at which every Australian sports lover excels.

Selector-bashing is the greatest sport on earth because you can't lose. If the players blow it, well obviously it was the fault of those damned selectors. You are vindicated. You are a genius. If the team plays well, the conversation just got changed for you and no one cares or remembers how aggrieved you were five days ago.

The selector bashers were out in force last week when Tim Paine, Shaun Marsh and Cameron Bancroft were added to the Australian lineup. They continued to feel extra good about themselves when Paine dropped a tough but very catchable catch early in this match, when Marsh grassed one on the boundary, and when Bancroft fell cheaply in Australia's first innings.

Then a funny thing happened while everyone was swimming in their big bubbly pool of schadenfraude.

Shaun Marsh: Unfashionable but effective.

Marsh dug in with the bat. Selectors wanted a man at number six who would provide solidity. They didn't want a "maybe man" as likely to make a duck as decimate an attack. They wanted a no-nonsense guy who would be a barrier between the sketchy upper order and the tail. A rock, not a fire-cracker. And Marsh was that.

At 34, and on his eighth recall to the team, the elder Marsh brother showed that all his international experience counted for something. Like Steve Smith, he assessed the rhythm of this game, and rightly judged that it was a siege, not an assault. He didn't last as long as Smith -- because who did? -- but in making 51 of 141 balls, he absolutely did his job.

Paine's contributions were of a different nature. Selectors were stuck between the encumbent wicket keeper who wasn't performing, the guy before him who didn't do much either, plus a bunch of young no-names. They went for a pick so left of left field, he was almost in right field.

"He has performed well for us whenever he has represented Australia in any format," chief selector Trevor Hohns said of Paine ahead of this match, and what Paine brought was cricket smarts.

It was Paine's appeal -- while his teammates stood silent and largely disinterested -- which led to the controversial stumping of Moeen Ali. Again it was his urging which resulted in Stuart Broad's demise from a feathered-edge. Paine didn't star with either bat or gloves, yet he played his part.

After going cheaply in the first innings, all the pressure was on the slender shoulders of 25-year-old West Australian Cameron Bancroft. He responded, bringing up his 50 off 111 watchful, straight-batted balls.

"He looked right at home, didn't he," was Smith's assessment of his debutant opener in the post-match interviews with Channel 9.

There was also that moment in the field earlier when Bancroft didn't flinch as a ball struck with great force thwocked into his helmet at short leg. It may well be that he had no time to react, so firmly was the ball struck. Yet this moment gave great weight to Hohns' assessment that he is "a very talented and tough cricketer who shows a good temperament for Test cricket".

This could all unravel as soon as this coming Saturday, when the second Test (a day-nighter) starts in Adelaide. Indeed, this could all have been irrelevant had Steve Smith not compiled one of the great Ashes centuries.

But the fact is, Smith still needed guys around him adding whatever lesser skills they could bring. He found them. Or rather, the selectors found them for him. Credit where it's due. Those bastard selectors got something right for a change.0

These ricotta pancakes are light, fluffy, gluten free and easy to make. Serve with caramelised figs (or banana), extra ricotta and raw honey.

Ricotta pancakes with caramelised honey figs

Recipe by Helen Tzouganatos, celiac food blogger of Hungry and Fussy.

"I love the fluffy lightness of these pancakes. They remind me of a light and airy Italian ricotta cheesecake but even better because they can be whipped up in five minutes," Tzouganatos said.

"In this recipe, I have prepared them with caramelised figs, but they are just as delicious served with a sprinkling of sugar and lemon juice as per my lemon ricotta variation. You can even spoon small drops of the batter into the frying pan and make delicious pikelets."

Preparation time: 5 minutes. Cooking time: 15 minutes.

Serves six.

INGREDIENTS

Pancakes:

3 eggs, separated

1 cup or 130g plain gluten free flour, sifted

¼ cup 55g caster sugar

2 teaspoons gluten free baking powder

Pinch of salt

¾ cup buttermilk

300g ricotta, plus extra to serve

Caramelised honey figs:

6 fresh figs, halved

1 tablespoon raw honey

1 tablespoon butter

METHOD

Whisk egg whites in a small bowl until stiff peaks form. Place all other ingredients into a bowl and whisk to combine. Add stiff egg whites to batter. Fold to combine. Melt a little butter in a frying pan over low to medium heat. Spoon batter into pan and cook pancakes for 2-3 minutes until bubbles pop on the surface. Flip over and cook for a further minute until golden. Repeat until all the batter is cooked. For caramelised figs, melt butter and honey in a frying pan over medium heat. Add figs and cook for one minute on each side until caramelised. To serve, smear pancakes with ricotta and place figs on top. Drizzle with honey.

Tips: the figs will caramelise quickly so keep your eye on them to avoid burning.

Variation: For lemon ricotta pancakes, add two teaspoons of lemon zest to batter. To serve, sprinkle pancakes with sugar and lemon juice.

Forests or fuel? Agriculture or energy? Fresh water or fracking? Beauty or balance sheets? And are these things mutually exclusive, or can we maybe have it all?

These questions are all about to play out in Australia's largest inland native forest, the Pilliga, in northern New South Wales.

The Pilliga is not what you'd call a pretty forest. It has neither the lushness of the Daintree, nor the towering grandeur of West Australia's Karri forests or Victoria's mountain ash. In truth it's more like scrub -- a patchwork of scraggly ironbark, thin-stemmed eucalypts and a plain native pine called cypress pine.

The Pilliga's creekbeds are sandy and its roads throw up a powdery dust that turns everything Donald Trump orange. Its emus, koalas and glossy black cockatoos are elusive. There are few lookouts or landmarks of note. The rest areas beside the Newell Highway -- the main road from Brisbane to Melbourne which barrels right through the heart of it -- are devoid of picnickers.

It takes about two hours to drive from Sydney to Newcastle. That gives you a good indication of the vast scale of The Pilliga -- which is the large area of forest to the south of Narrabri.

The Pilliga is a place few people go to see, and which most people are in a hurry to get through. But the Pilliga is vast and quiet. And when you spend two days driving its rutted tracks, you come to understand that its unrelenting, undulating featurelessness is its very charm.

But for how long?

Shot this footage 2day of the INCREDIBLE Pilliga forest, Australia's largest dryland forest. It's threatened by a huge coal seam gas project pic.twitter.com/gP4bZxltTC — Anthony Sharwood (@antsharwood) 6 de julho de 2017

The 'Pilliga Gas Project'

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull shifted the national focus to The Pilliga in the last week of September, when he announced that Australia's gas supply crisis was "three times worse than thought". "We encourage the New South Wales government to approve the development of the Narrabri Gas Project," the PM said. "The sooner that is brought online, the better."

The Narrabri Gas Project is an ambitious plan to drill 850 wells tapping underground natural gas reserves, which resources giant Santos said would be tapped for the domestic market.

But in a sense, the project's name is a misnomer. The "Narrabri Gas Project" brings to mind the town of 7,600 people on the Namoi River, which as the project's administrative base, would likely enjoy a temporary economic upswing. Indeed, Santos already employs 20-30 people at shopfronts in the area.

The Narrabri gas Project should arguably be called The Pilliga Gas Project, because the vast bulk of the 850 wells would be sunk in the Pilliga forest just south of Narrabri -- which consists of a mix of state forest, nature reserve, state conservation area, national park and freehold land.

Whatever you call it, this project -- which is currently in the planning approval phase -- would change the face of the Pilliga. And as the NSW government makes its decision, a fight is bubbling away not just over the forest itself, but over the forest's water resources, which some claim would be degraded.

The Pilliga is a recharge zone for the Great Artesian Basin -- Australia's vast, inland underground water resource without which so much of our agriculture would be unviable. Being a recharge zone means it's one of the few areas which provide significant new water to replenish the basin.

Farmers in areas bordering the Pilliga rely on bore water from the Great Artesian Basin. Their soils are rich but their rainfall is scant. They fear that a project of this scale will destroy the subterranean water pressure and dry up their bores. They also fear groundwater in the forest itself could be tainted.

Santos says there are numerous studies conducted by eminent scientists which have found that coal seam gas can be safely produced without harmful effects on ground or surface water. It cites Ex-CSIRO water expert Dr Richard Creswell, who said farmers' water would "not be impacted by any of the drilling that goes through the Great Artesian Basin to get to the gas".

But RMIT's Dr Matthew Currell -- who has been called up as part of the approval process to help assess the submissions -- told HuffPost Australia that "I think there's genuine concern about the protection of surface water systems and also groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the area".

The Pilliga is situated at the area of shaded blue that dips down into NSW.

The water wars are also being fought over the groundwater in the forest itself. The disputed point is whether the mix of chemicals involved in unconventional gas drilling will leave a toxic mess.

Santos directed HuffPost Australia to the 2014 study by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, which concluded that with appropriate safeguards and controls, natural gas can be safely extracted from coal seams. Richard Creswell said there are "at least three levels of protection" in the gas drilling process.

But RMIT's Matthew Currell said "there's no reason why any land holder that lives in vicinity of coal seam gas wells or waste water storage ponds could not have their water quality affected".

For now, we have a stand-off. Water versus gas. The Pilliga versus what many people see as the pillagers.

With the NSW Department of Planning approval process underway, it's highly unusual that the Prime Minister would overstep the boundaries of his authority, and urge the NSW state government to get cracking with the project.

HuffPost Australia contacted the office of NSW Planning Minister Anthony Roberts to ask whether the PM's urging could potentially help fast-track the approval process. A spokesman for the Minister told us:

"The NSW Government is assessing the Narrabri Gas Project proposal under clear planning legislation and policies. We have also established a panel of four independent scientific experts to advise on the potential water-related impacts. In addition, other government agencies such as the NSW Environment Protection Authority and NSW Crown Lands and Water are also providing advice. We consider all applications under the same rules to carefully assess any potential environmental, social, or economic impacts or benefits. We also closely consider community feedback... There is no set timeframe for determination."

There is much for the Department to assess. As HuffPost Australia reported in June when submissions closed, a record number of 23,000 submissions were received in response to resources giant Santos's proposal. Of these, just 300 were in favour. While many of the submissions opposed to the project are form letters, it's our understanding that at least 5,000 are carefully researched, informed statements of genuine concern.

No person has articulated her concerns with more passion than Anne Kennedy, a farmer from Coonamble, west of the Pilliga, who relies on Great Artesian Basin bore water.

"What you are doing is pitting fuel versus food. Which industry will still be necessary in 20 years? If you want to drink clean water and eat clean food, then this is your problem," Kennedy told HuffPost Australia.

Santos pointed us to a study which showed that "the collective impacts of coal mining and coal seam gas extraction can be effectively managed without negatively impacting agricultural water use across the region".

Pilliga-based ecologist David Paull, who has worked as an environment officer for both state and local governments, is unconvinced.

"I think the fact that there's a record-breaking number of submissions for this project than is a fairly good sign that it's not well received by the community. Certainly in the local region outside Narrabri area itself there's no support for it," he said.

Paull called Environmental Impact Statement for the Narrabri Gas Project "appalling". Santos said the environmental assessment process was "rigorous".

"Santos has the track record and expertise required to safely and sustainably develop the Narrabri Project and deliver reliable, affordable, clean natural gas to NSW for many years to come," a spokesman said.

It's likely that the decision on this project will be made in the first half of 2018. Expect passions to run high whichever way the dice rolls. The Pilliga does not have the emotional tug of some better-known iconic Australian landscapes like the Reef or the Tasmanian wilderness, but to locals, this great, largely uncelebrated Australian forest is everything.

"I'm just an old chook, a broken down farmer," Anne Kennedy said with unconvincing self-deprecation. Then her feisty self returned.

"There will be massive civil disobedience if they approve it. We're not going to give up without a fight."0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/12/14/how-to-know-when-your-relationship-is-over_a_23307808/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageHow To Know When Your Relationship Is OverWho you choose to spend your life with is an incredibly important decision ― and sometimes, you realize the person you thought was “the one” isn’t the right choice anymore.

But that doesn’t stop people from staying put in dead-end relationships, said Sheryl Ziegler, a counselor and author of the forthcoming book Mommy Burnout: How to Reclaim Your Life and Raise Healthier Children in the Process.

“Sometimes, fear is the only reason a person stays in a relationship even when they know it’s over: They fear being alone or not finding someone else,” she told HuffPost. “If that’s the case for you, and your partner is more of a source of stress rather than comfort, it may be time to end the relationship.”

What are some of the signs that a relationship has run its course? Below, Ziegler and other marriage experts share eight red flags.

1. You try to work out problems with your partner, but they never make an effort.

“I see couples in my office all the time complaining that they have problems communicating. One partner will say something like ‘I’ve told him hundreds of times not to come home late and he doesn’t listen. I just need help communicating it to him so he’ll understand.’ My response usually goes something like this: ‘Well, you’ve said it loud and clear just now. What do you think isn’t being understood?’ If you’ve said it over and over and if you’ve yelled and cried trying to get them to understand, then it’s time to move on. If they don’t understand it after all of that, they probably never will.” ― Aaron Anderson, a couples therapist in Denver, Colorado

2. One of you had an affair ― or multiple affairs ― and isn’t remorseful about it.

“Many couples enter relationships feeling confident that there are a few things they would absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, end a relationship over: affairs, addiction and physical or sexual abuse (the three A’s). I can tell you that infidelity is not and should not be a deal-breaker in relationships. Many couples can absolutely overcome sexual and emotional infidelity and rebuild a relationship that was better than it started at the altar. What is a sign that a relationship is ready to dissolve is when there is no sign of remorse or willingness to change after several attempts.” ― Laura Heck, a marriage and family therapist in Salt Lake City, Utah

3. You realize you don’t really like or respect your partner at their core.

“This is such a common reason to end a relationship. How could you possibly spend the next five years, much less the rest of your life, with someone you don’t admire? This may be a hard reality you need to confront. There could be a number of reasons why you’ve lost respect: Maybe you’ve been with this person for quite some time, but no one in your family or friend group really likes them ― and you’re starting to feel the same way. If you’re with a person who you don’t respect, it’s just not possible for your relationship to last long, much less grow and expand.” ― Gary Brown, a psychotherapist in Los Angeles

4. You rarely have sex.

“This shift is often gradual: less hand-holding, less kisses goodbye, fewer nights cuddling on the couch or in bed, and before you know it, there is no more foreplay. Sex then becomes something you do in the dark, with little to no romance and you’re counting the minutes until it is over. You initially make excuses for the changes: You’re still on your period or have a migraine. You slowly start breaking your evening rituals like watching your shows together or talking about your day. You go to bed either early or late. Before you know it, you not only don’t have sex, you no longer engage in all the pre-sex buildup: being affectionate, communicating and sharing a sense of playfulness. All of it is gone.” ― Sheryl Ziegler

5. You’ve asked your partner to go to couples therapy but they refuse to go.

“If you’ve been feeling stuck in a rut for a long time and have been crystal clear about needing a change ― perhaps you’ve suggested counseling ― and your partner does nothing, then your relationship is probably over. You may hope that things might change on their own, but your partner’s lack of interest is a clear sign that they don’t care. They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result; if your partner clearly doesn’t want anything different, expecting something to change is often fruitless.” ― Aaron Anderson

6. You’re fantasizing about another person.

“At some point, you may have become numb to the relationship. You no longer care to talk, you don’t even bother to fight and usually, sarcasm replaces the nasty words that used to come out of your mouth. Now, you’re condescending and find opportunities to point out when your partner is wrong or clueless. Then, you replace the anger with fantasies about another person in your life. One that is likely more attractive, smarter, more successful and probably better in bed. You find comfort in creating situations where you imagine this real or imagined other person in your life. It allows you to hold on to hope that you won’t be lonely if this relationship ends.” ― Sheryl Ziegler

7. You’re in a high-conflict relationship.

“If you can’t stop arguing and you have exhausted all other options to learn conflict management skills, it’s likely that your health, happiness and overall life satisfaction has taken a nose dive. It may be time to dissolve your relationship, especially if you have children. The good news? Research indicates that those in high-conflict marriages tend to increase their well-being post-divorce, especially women.” ― Laura Heck

8. Your big life goals no longer align.

“If you find yourself in a relationship where your basic wants, wishes, needs and life desires don’t really align, it’s time to move on. Let’s say you’ve always wanted children but now your partner is not so sure. If starting a family is a ‘must’ for you, this is not really something to compromise on ― it’s an obvious deal-breaker. Or it may be that he just wants to live together and you really want to get married. You could wait for years on end, and maybe it will work out, but if your partner is crystal clear that they are absolutely not into marriage, then you have your answer. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that they are going to change.” ― Gary Brown-1

Now, one of the people closely involved in the engagement is speaking out on how hard it was to keep that secret.

The designer of Markle's gorgeous engagement ring — a trio of diamonds on a yellow gold band — recently told Hello magazine that making the ring was the "biggest and hardest" secret he has ever had to keep.

Meghan Markle's engagement ring.

David Thomas, a jeweler at Cleave and Company Court Jewellers, also refused to discuss how much Harry paid for the ring, which features a large diamond sourced from Botswana, and two smaller diamonds which were from a tiara that once belonged to Princess Diana.

"Jewelers are like doctors: we never discuss our patients," Thomas explained.

He also won't make replicas. Unlike the Duchess of Cambridge's engagement ring, which has been copied the world over, Cleave and Company will not make reproduction rings for their customers.

"We're not going to be making replicas of it," Stephen Connelly, director of Cleave and Company, told Hello. "If you want a ring, then we'll design you a different one."

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on Nov. 27.

But if you are itching to get a lookalike ring, there are many options. "We are expecting Meghan's yellow gold band will spur its own increase in popularity for yellow gold in particular," Chloe Nalbantian, style director at wedding app Bridebook.co.uk, told HuffPost UK, which found some gorgeous alternatives.

But of course, these rings won't have the same sentimentality as Markle's. As Harry explained during the couple's first TV interview just after they appeared at Kensington Palace for a photo call, he purposely kept his mum in mind to "make sure that she's with us on this — on this crazy journey together" as he was designing the ring.

"It's so important to me to know that [Diana's] a part of this," noted Harry. "I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down."

Meghan Markle on Dec. 1.

Markle also knows how unique her engagement ring is, explaining in the broadcast interview, "It's incredible... It's incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this which sort of links where you come from and Botswana which is important to us and it's perfect."

Botswana, of course, is where we now know the prince and Markle went on their third "date," which ended up being a camping trip. "It was three, maybe four weeks later [after the second date] that I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars... then we were really by ourselves," Harry said in their TV interview.

A New York Times report published Tuesday night, as well as other reporting in recent months, detailed how Weinstein employed his status as a political power broker to help conceal his years of abusive behavior and intimidate those who tried to blow the whistle.

Weinstein often cited his connections to Democratic politicians, such as donating to and hosting star-studded fundraisers for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The Times reported:

“I know the president of the United States. Who do you know?” Mr. Weinstein, a Democratic fund-raiser, would say during the years Barack Obama was in the White House, adding expletives. “I’m Harvey Weinstein,” he used to say. “You know what I can do.”

Clinton and Obama did not appear to know about Weinstein’s abusive behavior. And like many of his collaborators in the entertainment world, they issued statements condemning him and expressing shock and disgust following the initial Times and New Yorker reports in early October exposing his history of sexual misconduct.

“Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status,” Obama said in a statement shortly after the initial stories.

The Obamas’ eldest daughter Malia, interested in filmmaking, worked as an intern at Weinstein’s production company earlier this year.

Clinton, who benefited from Weinstein’s deep pockets for years, similarly said she “was shocked and appalled by the revelations” about Weinstein and praised the “courage” of the women who spoke out about the mogul.

As recently as this fall, Weinstein and Clinton were working together on a television documentary about her campaign, according to the Times. Clinton scrapped the project as the stories about him emerged, her lawyer said.-1

While I was in it. I was driving past a train station and a group of about 10-12 teens, the majority of which were male, were crossing the road. I had a green light but, as anyone who had an L-Trent lesson before their provisional drivers license test will tell you, pedestrians always have right of way. I was expecting an apologetic, or at least appreciative wave as I stopped to let them pass. Instead they stared me down, yelled some things and punched my car.

There's a dent in my passenger door -- but the damage goes far beyond that. Because aside from frightening me to the point of tears they also proved they had absolutely zero respect for me as a person. And in case my byline hasn't given it away, I'm a woman.

Sure, it could have happened to anyone regardless of their gender. But the point is, it didn't. I want you to think about that. Because I have. My boyfriend has. My Dad has. My housemate has. And one thing we can all agree on is that the chances of it happening to one of them, in their big ol' utes, are a lot lower. In fact, even having one of them sitting in my passenger seat probably would have changed the outcome.

And isn't that exactly what every girl is taught? Men can hurt you, but they'll also protect you. You should text when you get home, avoid being alone anywhere after dark and make sure you have your keys ready when you're walking to your car. Speaking of cars, you should always lock the doors. Unless you're in the car with your partner, because the chances of him hurting you are actually pretty high. Oh, and never answer the door if you're home alone, unless you're expecting someone. But even then, that someone could hurt you.

But what I want to know is, when did driving home from a hairdresser appointment at 7pm on a Monday night become the wrong place at the wrong time?

Those teens felt totally OK about intimidating me. In fact, it was almost mindless behaviour. It was day one of the school holidays, after all. The whole exchange happened in about two minutes and I doubt they thought long and hard about gender inequality and whether they had respect for women before they did those things.They just knew I wasn't going to get out, chase them and ask for their name and address just to avoid paying the $821 excess on my insurance. I was powerless in that moment and they knew it. That's what troubles me most.

A national study showed that young Australians have alarming views on violence against women, with 22 percent of young people agreeing that men should take control in relationships, two in five believing rape resulted from men not being able to control their sexual urges and 20 percent believing women often said 'no' when they meant 'yes'.

Malcolm Turnbull said yesterday: "We have to make it as though it was un-Australian to disrespect women. We must become a country which is known for its respect for women."

I agree.

If these kids have these underlying views, whether it comes from a place of naivety or not, bad things are going to continue to happen. Shitty kids grow up and they take their shitty views with them.

I'm not suggesting these teens represent all teens, I'm just angry that they have enough power to affect how safe I feel when driving home at 7pm on a Monday night.-1

I was a late bloomer. This always bothered me because I was surrounded by girls who were always two steps ahead. I had a best friend who was all tits and tampons well before me, and sisters who were happily sporting their double Ds. While me -- I was stuck with little mozzie bites you could barely see.

I was desperate to grow up, to graduate from butterfly clips to a belly button ring. I remember a friend showing my sister and I her first pubic hair. It was this big event. We walked out to the middle of our farm's paddock for privacy; she pulled down her pants and pointed out the one sole hair. I was enamoured -- I wanted some of these black curly things! Who knew years later I'd spend a pretty penny and many painful hours fighting to get rid of them.

Puberty for me was bittersweet. The changes (finally) came; hair, blood, boobs and moods, but so did the expectations. Suddenly, I was expected to act like a woman. Gone were the days of sitting sans undies, cross-legged and carefree.

Why does naked frolicking in sprinklers with friends suddenly have to stop?

As a kid I used to run from the bathroom to my bedroom stark naked -- fresh from the shower I felt free and uninhibited. My family were my obliged audience and they never cared, until now. I distinctly remember my Mum sitting me down and explaining it was inappropriate for me to continue this morning ritual now that I was a woman. I get it now, I imagine it got wildly uncomfortable for Dad who was seeing his baby girl grow into a buxom, full-breasted babe, but at the time I remember thinking 'wow, being a woman sucks'.

I felt this dichotomy -- a yearning to grow up versus a wanting to stay the same. I couldn't do both, which is something I still don't fully understand. Why does naked frolicking in sprinklers with friends suddenly have to stop?

I guess you start becoming sexy (also running with no bra starts being not so fun). But I feel like girls in particular aren't given a chance to ease into sexuality. Your body changes and all of a sudden everything you did as a kid transforms into erotica; licking an ice cream, pillow fights, pool parties, Twister. My body had jumped ahead but my head was still unknowing and innocent.

Moreover, things I loved were suddenly not kosher in my new adult life. I had to let go of stuffed toys, acting in home movies, building pillow forts and cubby houses. One of my happiest memories, which plays like a Super 8 movie, is of me and my sisters navigating a ship (mattresses piled four high) through the Bermuda triangle (for some reason we were obsessed with the Bermuda triangle and I still have no idea why). We were all young with nothing but fun and adventure on our minds.

I don't want to finish with this post with something trite like a plea to treasure your youth. Rather, fight to keep it -- everything fun, unrestrained, blithe and bold. Don't let societal constructs or third-party opinion shape you. Take whatever you like along with you into adulthood, from that Spice Girls Impulse to that half-up half-down hair do.

Just do you.

This may be exciting for the Victoria's Secret models of the world, but for the rest of us, the prospect of stripping down to next to nothing in a public place can be somewhat daunting.

Not to mention the fact there's more to the perfect swimsuit than just looking good. Those bad boys need to support you (quite literally) in the surf, on the sand and -- importantly -- when you're doing your best slow-motion 'Baywatch' run.

But finding the perfect pair of swimmers can be quite an arduous task, especially when dealing with post-winter padding.

So how do you find the right swimsuit for you? HuffPost Australia spoke to Tash Oakley and Devin Brugman of Monday swimwear to find out.

HP: Swimwear shopping can be daunting at the best of times. What are the most flattering styles out this season?

Devin and Tash: "We've worn every style of swimwear, but it's still hard to say which is universally flattering because every body type is so unique. If we had to name one it would be a classic tie side triangle bikini, mainly because it is fully adjustable so you can alter it to fit your own body type. Flattery in swimwear really comes down to adjustability."

A common frustration for women with bigger busts is finding swimwear or a bikini top that supports them without looking like a 'nanna bra'. What styles/cuts are best for them? What styles/cuts should they avoid?

"This is something we struggled to answer ourselves for the longest time and one of the main reasons we created our own swimwear line. We recommend a wider strapped halter neck top that won't dig, an underwire top for a comfortable and flattering fit, or a fully adjustable classic triangle top."

Make sure you pick something that's going to support you in the water.

For those concerned about their mid-section, what are your best tips for a flattering swimsuit?

"A structured one piece featuring a deep V neckline, double lining to help you feel secure, a supportive waist panel and adjustable straps are key. A V-neck and slightly higher cut leg help to add length to the torso and the legs, sweetening all of your mid-section woes. High-waisted bottoms with medium coverage and shaping side panels to sculpt your silhouette and cinch in the waist work really well.

"For new mums, we recommend a fully adjustable triangle style like our Tulum top and bottoms, designed to accommodate fluctuation in cup sizes."

Are there any patterns you would recommend or avoid? (Also, do stripes really make you look bigger?)

"There are all sorts of fashion no-no's when it comes to prints and patterns, but I think swimwear is an exception. If you're into prints, just focus on finding one that really resonates with you -- choosing a new suit is meant to evoke feelings of confidence and fun, and most prints inspire this kind of attitude. In regards to a stripe print, it really depends on the style of stripe, but this definitely applies more to clothing than swimwear."

If you want to accentuate your booty but you don't want to rock a brazilian-style suit, what shapes or cuts would you recommend?

"A higher cut in the leg is a great, subtle way to accentuate your booty. You don't have to be showing more to flaunt what you've got. Go for styles that offer a medium coverage, and are perfect for wearing a little higher on the hips to create length and add a little lift to the booty."

Do you have any advice around sizing? As in is it worthwhile 'mixing and matching' your bikini tops and bottoms?

"Absolutely! We strongly recommend considering your options when it comes to shopping for swimwear. More and more brands are finally catching on to the fact that not everyone is a perfect size 6 or 12 or 14... Devin was very passionate about creating a line of swimwear that didn't discriminate against separate sizing, so every single suit in the Monday Swimwear range is sold separately. This also let's you get creative with styles, not just sizing, so you can create a set that suits you perfectly!"

What swimwear styles would you recommend for the following body types?

Hourglass

"You want to highlight your curves, while still providing enough support and coverage. A bra style top with underwire and supportive straps is always great option, paired with high waisted bottoms is the perfect combo for an hourglass figure."

Apple

"Whether you're looking to completely cover, or slim your mid-section, one pieces or high waisted styles are your best friend."

Straight up and down

"If your goal is to accentuate your curves, go for styles that give that cinch in the waist, accencuate your derriér, and add a little more shape to the bust. One pieces with a waist band are great for this, as are wrap tops that can be tied around the mid section."

Pear

"To balance out your curves, try to accentuate your top half by choosing styles that broaden your shoulders and highlight your décolletage. Bra style tops with underwire and sculpted cups that provide a little lift are the perfect option to get this effect, and pairing with bikini bottoms that feature delicate side straps will give the illusion of narrower hips. If tie sides aren't your thing, go for straps that can be hitched a little higher to elongate the leg."

Is there any other advice or tips you want to share?

"In terms of sizing, you should NEVER try to "stick to your size" in swimwear. I personally wear every size from an XS to an XL in swimwear due to the fact that sizing is by no means standardized. Ignore the tag, whatever feels good is good.

"In regard to season trends -- stylish and flattering underwire tops. There is nothing sexier when done right!"0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/28/how-to-make-easy-gingerbread-men_a_23230561/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageHow To Make Easy Gingerbread MenNo biscuit quite says 'Christmas' like gingerbread cookies -- the fragrance of cinnamon and nutmeg filling the house, the sweet, caramely flavour, the cute little shapes. The best part? Gingerbread cookies are a cinch to make.

If you can't get enough of Christmas (even if it's a month away) or are thinking about making homemade gifts this Christmas, try this recipe for gingerbread men by Teresa Cutter, aka The Healthy Chef. And if you want to spice them up even more, there's a second recipe for chocolate gingerbread cookies.

Plus, as these recipes use wholesome ingredients like spelt flour, buckwheat flour and unrefined sugar, these treats are somewhat healthier than your regular gingerbread cookies.

Gingerbread men

These are the perfect addition to your Christmas table or bundled together as a delicious gift. What I love about these cookies is that they taste like shortbread with a delicate hint of vanilla and spice.

Makes 30 cookies, depending on the size of your cutter.

INGREDIENTS

250g (1 cup) butter, softened

80g (½ cup) rapadura or coconut sugar

1 tablespoon raw honey

Pinch sea salt

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 organic egg

360g (3 cups) wholemeal spelt flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon ginger

100g good quality white chocolate for decoration (optional)

METHOD

Cream the butter, rapadura, honey, sea salt and vanilla with a whisk or the paddle attachment of your mixer. Scrape the sides of your bowl and add the egg. Mix ingredients until combined. Combine the spelt flour, baking powder, cinnamon and ginger in a separate bowl. Add dry ingredients with the wet ingredients and mix until combined. Scrape the dough onto a piece of baking paper and flatten slightly. Wrap up the dough with another piece of baking paper and place into the fridge to rest for at least two hours. Preheat oven to 160°C (320°F) fan-forced. Remove dough from the fridge and roll between two sheets of baking paper until the dough is ½ cm thick. Cut the cookies into shapes (you can use gingerbread cookie cutters, squares, circles or any other shape you would love your cookie to be). Place cookies onto a lined baking tray. Bake for 20–30 minutes or until cookies are just golden. Remove cookies from the oven and cool completely. Decorate the cookies with white chocolate, if you desire, or serve on their own.

Notes: to decorate your cookies, melt white chocolate in a small bowl over a small pot of simmering water. When the chocolate is completely melted, remove from the heat and pour into a small piping bag made from baking paper. Decorate your cookies and enjoy.

Chocolate gingerbread men

An indulgent twist on a classic favourite, these gingerbread men help spread the Christmas cheer. The antioxidants from the cacao helps to naturally boost the feel-good chemicals in the body.

Makes 30 cookies, depending on the size of your cutter.

INGREDIENTS

240g (1 cup) butter

80g (½ cup) rapadura, coconut sugar or unrefined raw sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Pinch sea salt

240g (2 cups) buckwheat flour

60g (½ cup) cacao powder

½ teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

100g good quality white chocolate for decoration (optional)

METHOD

Combine butter, rapadura, vanilla and sea salt into the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat well for 5-8 minutes until light and creamy. Combine buckwheat flour, cacao, baking powder and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Add dry ingredients into the creamed butter and mix through lightly until combined. Scrape the dough onto a piece of baking paper and flatten slightly. Wrap up the dough with another piece of baking paper and place into the fridge to rest for at least four hours. Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F) fan-forced. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll between two sheets of baking paper until the dough is ½ cm thick. Cut the cookies into your desired shapes and place them onto a lined baking tray. Bake for 20–30 minutes or until cookies are cooked through. Remove cookies from the oven and cool completely. Decorate the cookies with melted white chocolate, if you desire, or serve on their own.

Notes: add 100g dark chocolate pieces to make luscious choc chip gingerbread cookies.1

But when Kerry Magro was a child, meeting jolly old Saint Nick wasn't that easy. "Growing up with autism, I had challenges in meeting Santa in public places because I dealt with a lot of sensory challenges, so giant malls were never really an option for me," he told HuffPost. The blaring music, the sparkling decorations, the crowds of people could all be too much to handle. To make this holiday tradition more accessible to kids facing similar struggles, the 29-year-old now provides "sensory friendly" visits with Santa. And who better to play the man in red than Magro himself?

KFM Making A Difference Kerry Magro offers sensory friendly visits with Santa, in which he dresses as the man in red.

Magro, a motivational speaker, author and activist, will be Santa again at an autism and sensory friendly event in Jersey City on Dec. 9 and 10. Since starting this tradition three years ago with his nonprofit, KFM Making a Difference, Magro said he has welcomed some 500 children with various challenges, including autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Parents sign their kids up for 30-minute slots so the children won't feel rushed or overwhelmed, Magro explained. The usual loud Christmas music and bright lights are turned down. Only eight kids with sensory challenges are allowed per time slot. They can participate in arts and crafts, and take home a photo with Santa. An occupational therapist, a speech therapist and a physical therapist ― possibly dressed as Santa's elves ― are also on site.

KFM Making A Difference Since starting the event three years ago, Magro and his team have welcomed kids with autism, ADHD and other challenges.

As for "Santa," he lets the kids take their time and pays attention to their different levels of development. "We don't want them to feel rushed. We don't want them to feel overloaded," Magro told HuffPost. "We just want to make it a labor of love." Magro describes his own childhood as "a time when a lot of people just really had no idea what autism was." He was nonverbal until he was 2-and-a-half years old and struggled with sensory challenges. It took his parents 18 months to obtain a formal diagnosis. Thanks to "a lot of therapy," Magro said, he grew up to be someone who now advocates for others with autism and, through his nonprofit, gives scholarships to students with autism to pursue higher education.2

For the past five years, the commission has put civic and state institutions like churches, the defense force, sporting clubs and after-school care under the microscope, examining their responses to allegations of sex abuse in their ranks.

The commission’s investigation has exposed a national tragedy of systemic abuse by shining a light on persistent failings of institutions to keep children safe, of cultures of secrecy and cover-up, and the devastating effects child sexual abuse can have on a life.

According to the report, tens of thousands of children have suffered abuse over a period of decades, most of them in religious institutions but also in state, private and not-for profit institutions, such as orphanages, clubs, prominent schools, juvenile detention centers and in disabled care.

“It is impossible not to share the anger many survivors have felt when they tell us of their betrayal by people they believed they were entitled to trust,” commission chair Peter McClellan said at the final hearing Thursday.

“Many spoke of having their innocence stolen, their childhood lost, their educations and prospective career taken from them, and their personal relationships damaged for the rest of their lives.”

The commission was set up in 2012 by Prime Minister Julia Gillard following explosive allegations by the former detective chief inspector of New South Wales, Peter Fox, over how the Roman Catholic Church covered up reports of abuse.

The commission received bipartisan support and a wide mandate to examine institutional responses to child sexual abuse across the country and report to government on what it found and make recommendations about how to proceed.

At the heart of its work were the personal stories of survivors. Combined, the six royal commissioners held more than 8,000 private sessions and received more than 1,300 written survivor accounts.

Survivors were invited to write about their experiences and hopes for the future, all of which would be included in a commemorative collection.

“The resulting book is, I have to say, too heavy to lift,” Gail Furness, a counsel assisting the commission, told a packed hearing room in Sydney on Thursday.

What Did It Uncover?

The commission held more more than 400 days of public hearings and heard allegations about misconduct at 3,489 institutions.

Friday’s final report revealed that most of the allegations, 58.1 percent, were made against institutions managed by a religious body.

Of those who told the commission they were abused in a religious institution, 61.4 percent said they experienced abuse in a Catholic institution, followed by 14.8 percent in an Anglican institution.

The investigators found 60 percent of survivors had never disclosed the abuse before, and only about 6 percent had reported it to authorities.

The investigation would touch major institutions and major public figures. The Vatican’s third-ranking official, Australia’s George Pell, appeared before the Royal Commission multiple times to answer questions about how he, as a senior church official, handled allegations of abuse in the diocese of Ballarat and Melbourne.

But it was the sheer systemic size that shocked most of all. Testimony repeatedly detailed failures of leadership and the triumph of institutional greed at the expense of little children.

According to the commission’s analysis, 60,000 survivors would be eligible to make a claim for compensation under a national redress scheme.

Results And Recommendations

In October the federal government tabled a bill for a national redress scheme that would cap payments to survivors at $150,000 each in Australian dollars (about $115,000 U.S.) in compensation.

It’s now up to all states and territories to sign on to the plan, which is meant to take effect in July.

The commission recommended that the government also set up a national framework and an office for child safety. It also recommended that priests and other religious leaders be compelled by law to report child sex abuse to police, even if heard in the confessional.-1

Presenters Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell and Sharon Stone revealed the newly minted honorees from film and television at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.

Tonya Harding pulled off the triple axel, but will Margot Robbie take home gold for her performance in “I, Tonya”? Or will Emma Stone build upon her awards momentum from last year and game, set, match the competition as Billie Jean King in “Battle of the Sexes”? Critically celebrated films like “Get Out,” “Call Me By Your Name” and “Dunkirk” are also expected to be recognized

On the TV side, HBO’s not-so-limited series “Big Little Lies” could dominate in its categories after a nearly clean Emmys sweep earlier this year. The Globes are also likely to recognize Elisabeth Moss and the rest of “The Handmaid’s Tale” after a stellar (and terrifying) debut season on Hulu. Of course, as always, expect to bow down to “The Crown.”

The Globes, which honor the best in both movies and television, will air Jan. 7 on NBC, hosted by Seth Meyers.

The bear is pulling his body across an iceless emptiness, desperately seeking food.

“This is what climate change looks like,” said the National Geographic article on the bear, which was captured on film by photographer Paul Nicklen last summer as Nicklen traveled with the conservation group Sea Legacy. The bear was spotted checking out trash cans left by Inuit fishermen and pulling out a tidbit or two.

As Nicklen and other photographers filmed the distraught animal, “we stood there crying,” he said.

Normally the bear would have been fattened up on seals the previous winter and would soon be eating more, but the seals are vanishing along with the snow and ice on the islands due to climate change.

Nicklen said that he was unable to help the bear and that it’s illegal in Canada to feed the animals in any case. He said he wanted to film the horror of the once-majestic animal’s demise to show the dramatic effects of climate change. Nicklen said he hopes the images help affect human behavior so that the bear will not have died in vain.

“When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death,” said Nicklen. “This is what a starving bear looks like.”

It’s a “soul-crushing scene that still haunts me,” Nicklen wrote in an Instagram post. “But I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy.”-1

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/05/how-blockchain-technology-is-helping-syrian-refugees_a_23267543/How Blockchain Technology Is Helping Syrian RefugeesAzraq Refugee Camp is a 15 kilometre-wide sea of corrugated aluminium houses in the heart of the vast Jordanian desert. The people that live there are detained by the barbed wire that surrounds the entire complex which is located an hour and a half from the country's capital city, Amman.

The people who live in the camp have escaped the horrors of the Syrian Civil War and reside there indefinitely. The knowledge that life as it was has been destroyed is coupled with the overwhelming uncertainty of when normality might return.

From within the strange environment of the camp and the indistinct future, lies a bastion of normalcy for these people -- the supermarket.

In the refugee camp the supermarket is much more than a place to shop or purchase food though: Here it is a vital fibre in the social fabric of a makeshift community.

Regardless of whether shoppers go to buy one tiny thing or to spend a while weaving through the isles, the supermarket is a hub for human interaction -- a place to talk and to share stories.

It's unbelievable to think then, that a place that is so remote and isolated could be home to a world first initiative involving the emerging Blockchain technology.

The Building Blocks Project is the brain child of Houman Haddad, Regional CBT Advisor for United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The project aims to make cash-based transactions between the WFP and the beneficiary faster, cheaper and more secure.

Prior to the project's launch at the Azraq Refugee Camp in Jordan in May 2017, it was first trialled in Pakistan and also in King Abduallah Park Refugee Camp as a means of testing the robustness of the technology. On May 31st 2017 the pilot in Azraq was extended indefinitely.

Traditionally, payments are made to refugees from the WFP via a third party financial service provider. The entity could be a bank, mobile monetary company or something similar and the WFP instructs the financial service provider to credit some of the funds to the refugee so they can spend it at the supermarket or elsewhere.

On top of that, the WFP also needs to transfer the funds to the third party so they can actually pay the beneficiary. Sounds complicated right? Well, the Building Blocks Project aims to eliminate reliance on a third party and with this comes plenty of savings.

The supermarket is a place of social interaction.

"So, what we have done is essentially replaced that financial service provider with the Blockchain," Houman Haddad told HuffPost Australia.

"So instead of having someone else create virtual accounts and credit functions and so on and so forth, we create the virtual account on the Blockchain for beneficiaries, we upload entitlements to them, and currently in the supermarket where they go, the supermarket requests an authorisation code for transactions from the Blockchain as opposed to the bank.

"So we have reduced the bank cost of the financial service provider, or the total cost of what would have gone into doing this, by 98 percent, because we're now just paying the funds transfer to the retailer ... we're not paying additional services for creating all these virtual accounts, paying them, producing reports and so on and so forth, that's all being done on the Blockchain."

Blockchain makes it easier for refugees to access donated funds.

For this kind of transaction to work, the blockchain requires some kind of verification to prove the person purchasing goods at the supermarket is the same person to whom the money belongs. Building Blocks uses IrisGuard scanning technology to do this, were the beneficiary scans their eye when they wish to purchase something at the supermarket, with their iris acting as the password to their account. Haddad explains that this makes accessing funds easier for refugees.

"In Jordan, they so happen to already be using the iris scanning technology for identification, so our beneficiaries don't need anything more than their iris to transact," Haddad said.

"So when they visit a supermarket, they scan their iris, their identity is verified and that identity and the amount of the purchase is automatically sent to the Blockchain, which authenticates, records the transaction and sends the confirmation back to the supermarket to essentially issue the receipt and let the beneficiary be on their way."

The iris acts as an account password.

There are many major benefits that come with using Blockchain technology in its humanitarian aid capacity that span beyond financial savings. One of these possibilities involves a person's transaction records from the blockchain being used to establish a credit history.

Due to the nature of Blockchain technology, each refugee transaction is locked on an unchangeable digital ledger that can be moved across borders, meaning that in the future refugees could experience a smoother transition back into normal life once they return to their home countries.

"In the case of refugees, it's not a document that can be actively taken away from them or something they can be persecuted for stuff on, at the same time they'll have access wherever they go," Haddad said.

"So, what we're doing right now is essentially we're creating financial transaction histories for beneficiaries and just showing that your money may not be very meaningful on its own, but if you can show that you can save a bit of money, this can potentially count towards a credit score. So let's say if a refugee then returns to Syria, potentially they could get a small business loan based on this and get back on their own feet."

It's in this way that Building Blocks is currently looking at transferring refugee's identity onto the Blockchain as well. This will provide a secure, and unalterable record of an individual's identity, meaning that a refugees can prove that they are who they say they are without having to carry identification documents.

"They don't have to carry identification documents because their identity can be verified through their iris, essentially. But the identity is not yet fully on the Blockchain, that's something that were hoping to achieve as part of our future plans," Haddad said.

Blockchain transaction histories could potentially be used towards a credit score.

Bernhard Kowatsch is the United Nations Head of the WFP Innovation Accelerator, the group that is responsible for finding and nurturing ideas like the Building Blocks Project, that harness disruptive technology to help end global hunger.

The Innovation Accelerator was officially launched in June 2016, and since then has supported over 30 projects like Haddad's to change the way society approaches issues related to hunger and to assist in reaching the Sustainable Development Goal to end hunger by 2030.

Kowatsch told HuffPost Australia that Building Blocks is remarkable because of the way it has helped people in such a short period of time.

"It only took six months to really get from starting to 10,500 people to get to cutting edge tech such as Blockchain and revamping the way we do things," Kowatsch said.

"We are able to save money, it works and it has huge potential to broaden the tech in Jordan other countries and humanitarian aid companies. So right now the plan is to expand the program to 100,000 refugees by the end of the year and by early 2018 the whole camp population."

The WFP aims to extend the Building Blocks Project to the whole camp by 2018.

Kowatsch also said that innovations that utilise disruptive technologies, such as Blockchain, have the unique ability to begin to solve some of the long-standing humanitarian problems by giving displaced people the ability to access funds and institutions that they otherwise wouldn't be able to connect to.

"Why it is interesting for us to look into innovations is that one-in-nine people on this planet are still considered hungry -- hungry meaning they don't have enough calories to live a healthy life, so that is 815 million people and clearly there are still way too many people that are considered hungry.

"This work has adopted the goal of the Sustainable Development Goal ... number two which is ending hunger by 2030 and to do that we do need more innovations ... we need not only the ideas but also the brightest minds."

Houman Haddad at an early Building Blocks trial in Pakistan in 2017.

Haddad said that avoiding a solutionist approach is key to the success of the Building Blocks Project, where it is successful in assisting people without impacting their lives in a negative way.

"I feel good, I mean honestly, again this was from the napkin drawing to now, we've gone through a lot," Haddad said.

"I've been worried often about beneficiaries and changing the impact of their lives and disruption, all of that, and so far ... it's all been positive.

"When you're in the Blockchain space, a lot of people ask you, 'why Blockchain, why not something else?' And it is true, you can do a lot of things off of Blockchain but now the question becomes 'why not Blockchain, not why Blockchain?'"1

South Korean and U.S. officials are investigating.

“North Korea launched an unidentified ballistic missile eastward from the vicinity of Pyongsong, South Pyongan Province, at dawn today,” South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said, noting the missile flew a distance of nearly 600 miles and reached an altitude of around 2,800 miles. The Japanese government reportedly said the missile flew for about 50 minutes and landed off the coast of Japan.

These figures suggest the missile would have a range of more than 8,100 miles if flown on a standard trajectory, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, making it North Korea’s longest missile test yet. “Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any part of the continental United States,” the organization noted.

The missile “went higher, frankly, than any previous shot they’ve taken,” said U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

Seoul conducted a “precision strike” missile launch minutes later in response to North Korea’s provocation, per Yonhap. South Korean President Moon Jae-in also convened a National Security Council meeting.

Tuesday’s test is the first since North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan on Sept. 15. A Japanese government source said earlier on Tuesday that Tokyo had detected radio signals suggesting North Korea could be preparing to fire another ballistic missile, Reuters reported.

U.S. President Donald Trump responded to the situation on Tuesday afternoon, saying, “We will take care of it.” He did not offer details. The Pentagon’s initial assessment indicates that North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile.

The launch further escalates tensions with the United States and the international community after a series of similar provocations by the isolated nation. It comes two weeks after Trump’s return from a 12-day trip through Asia.

While in Vietnam earlier this month, Trump continued to taunt North Korean leader Kim Jong Un via Twitter.-1

It's small, wooden ladder, perched under a church window. Old wood. Dusty, even from a distance. It's the kind of thing a janitor might use to reach the high glass.

And for almost 360 years, no one has been able to agree on what to do with it.

Why?

Well, it's no ordinary church, which makes it no ordinary ladder.

The immovable ladder has been in place at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for at least 260 years.

The ladder has only been moved twice in more than two centuries because the six churches who govern the site can't agree on who'll take possession of it

Or maybe it is just an ordinary ladder, depending on where you're coming from.

The so-called "immovable ladder" has been outside outside a window at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jeruselam's old City since at least the 1750's.

The Church itself, located in the Christian quarter behind the high walls of Jerusalem's Old City, is a cavernous and ancient network of buildings (all up, it's more than 1,600 years old) and erected on what's traditionally been the sites where Jesus of Nazareth was crucified and resurrected.

People pack into the courtyard of the church through two small gates, forming a mass of bodies at the entrance to the church which is nestled within the confined and vibrant streets and markets of the old city.

Crowns of Thorne hang outside the entrance to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre's courtyard.

The building is managed in separate parts by six of Christianity's oldest churches under a complex tradition called the Status quo, which stems from a decree by Ottoman Sultan Osman III in the 18th century (and the occasional intervention of European powers).

So because everything in the Church is shared, none of the six churches who govern the site can agree on who'll take possession of the ladder. And so it remains. Incidentally a Muslim family has cared for the keys to the church for centuries.

The ladder, though, despite its name, has been moved twice, once in 1997 and again in 2009, for brief periods.

Worshippers kiss the 'anointing stone' inside the entrance of the Church. The stone is traditionally held to be the site where Jesus' body was prepared for burial.

Inside and outside the church, faithful line up for hours to worship, undeterred by the renovations inside the cavernous -- but beautifully decorated -- network of old buildings within.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/15/qanda-one-nations-malcolm-roberts-claims-nasa-corrupted-climate_a_21451832/Q&A: One Nation's Malcolm Roberts Claims NASA Corrupted Climate Science DataOne Nation senator-elect Malcolm Roberts told a stunned Q&A audience that NASA is manipulating climate science data.

He claimed that this is misleading scientists and creating an illusion of global warming, which, he says, does not exist.

In a Q&A science special on Monday night, Roberts went head to head with prominent physicist Brian Cox as the pair sat on a panel with Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science Greg Hunt and ALP Minister Linda Burney among others.

Roberts is a prominent climate change denier who, according to One Nation's website, joined the party in order to "expose the corruption" behind the climate change movement. He has previously suggested that climate change is a conspiracy fostered by the United Nations and world banks to impose a socialist world order.

"The latest warming cycle in the 17th century going into the 18th century is faster and greater than the latest warming which finished in 1995" he told Monday night's audience.

"And Justin Bieber wasn't flying his private jet around then. Now we've had a pause for 21 years," Roberts said.

Cox then jumped in with a couple of graphs he'd prepared earlier -- a move which was met with resounding applause and cheers from the audience.

Using the graphs, Cox demonstrated the steep increase in global temperatures since the 1950s and then went on to explain the correlation between the unprecedented rise in global temperatures and the increase in carbon dioxide emissions.

Roberts countered Cox's explanation by suggesting that his graphs had also "been corrupted" and the two proceeded to go back and forth until host Tony Jones jumped in saying: "Malcolm, you are hearing the interpretation of a highly qualified scientist and you're just saying, 'I don't believe that' - is that right?'"

However, Roberts -- who was elected into the Senate with only 77 personal votes to his name -- continued to allege that the data was being corrupted (and/or manipulated) by NASA.

You can watch the entire awkward, impassioned exchange here:

We've had a pause in warming & NASA corrupted data, says Malcolm Roberts. @ProfBrianCox examines the graphs #QandA https://t.co/HTNk4Bzrk1 — ABC Q&A (@QandA) August 15, 2016

Greg Hunt then stepped in, saying the federal government didn't make policy decisions around "conspiratorial conclusion".

"Our policy is that it's real and it is important, and it is significant."

Cox urged viewers to find their own answers in data and reports from "trusted sources" online including the federal government and NASA.

While Roberts denied the figure that 97 percent of scientists believe in climate change, there was a small moment of comic relief.

"The wonderful thing about humans is that I believe we are the ultimate resource on this planet," Roberts said, answering a question about the collaboration of science and art.

"All other resources are made by us, defined by us, and so it's the creativity in humans and the initiative in humans, and the love in humans that encourages us to explore and to understand, and to really care about others.

"I believe most humans really care about each other. Music, science are wonderful paths to explore that."

But it was Tony Jones who got the last word.

"Do you know that 97 percent of this people in this room agreed with what you just said?"

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/12/01/here-are-the-best-and-worst-christmas-hams_a_21618811/Here Are The Best (And Worst) Christmas HamsYep, it's that time of year again, whether we like it or not.

The Christmas trees are up, your bank balance has massively depleted, the kids are counting down the days and your neighbourhood has transformed into Santa Wonderland.

It's also a time when we all -- whether you're a Grinch or not -- get excited about the Christmas food we're amount to inhale. Fresh prawns, cherries, pudding, roast veggies, summer salads, champagne, pavlova and your aunty's trifle.

And we can't forget Christmas ham. You know, the tasty treat you eat on Christmas Day and continue to add to toasties, sandwiches, cheese platters, omelettes and quiches for the next six months.

The hardest thing about getting a huge leg of ham? Deciding which one to get.

Well, we've done the hard work for you. How generous of us to blind taste test five Christmas hams from the main Aussie supermarkets -- plus an extra deluxe ham. (It really was a hard job.)

So, here you are. Here are the best (and worst) Christmas hams.

Coles Finest Australian Triple Smoked RSPCA Approved Free Range Full or Half Leg

According to the description, this free range pork is cured with hand-harvested Mount Zero Pink Lake Salt and is triple smoked over beechwood for a full flavour with subtle, sweet smokiness.

Price: $14/kg

Judge one: This is a pleasant ham but it's a bit one-note. It's a tiny bit dry. It has a mild taste the kids will like, but there's nothing special.

Judge two: I have to agree, I find it to be a bit one-note, and that's a subtle note -- I can barely hear it. I'm not getting much flavour from this ham. It's also a little powdery.

Judge three: That's as bland as buggery. If it was served to me on Christmas Day I would require a very strong sauce to go with it.

Judge four: Hmm. Very dry, I think. And stringy. Very unimpressive.

Notes: good ham for the kids or as a base for glazing.

Aldi Specially Selected Premium Triple Smoked Half Leg Ham

This ham is made with 100 percent Australian pork, and is triple smoked for a full-bodied, complex flavour.

Price: $10.99/kg

Judge one: This one is fatty. This one I like more. It's got a nice texture. It's dry-ish but it's not chalky or powdery. It's a good classic ham with a touch more depth. It's still an unchallenging piece of meat, but slides down a little easier and has a bit more flavour.

Judge two: This ham would not ruin my Christmas. It does the job. There's depth to this one, there's more complex flavours, and it's not too salty.

Judge three: I don't think the flavour is going to knock you over the head and fell you, but it does have more flavour than the first one and the texture is a lot better.

Judge four: I think this is more ham-like in colour. The other one felt a bit more grey, this one is more pink. I actually think this is quite salty, much more in line with how I like my ham. I would go back for seconds. With chutney.

Notes: a good all-rounder for both children and adults.

Rare Breed Black Berkshire Ham Bone In, Exclusive to Haverick

According to the description, this carefully selected first-class Rare Breed Black Berkshire Ham is distinguished for its heavy marbling, intramuscular fat and tremendous meat quality, making it juicy and full of flavour.

Price: starting from $17.90/kg

Judge one: I think it's got a really good texture. It combines stringy and moistness really well. Usually stringy equates to dry, but it performs a really nice trick in being both stringy and moist. The taste is subtle, but a little boring.

Judge two: From appearance, this seems like a very fatty ham. Ugh. No. Look, to me it has a really peculiar flavour. It has a rich ham flavour, but it tastes artificial to me. I don't know why that is. I preferred the one we had last. I'm tasting essence of popcorn now...

Judge three: I thought the texture was very good and I could imagine being able to slice this thin or thick and it would be equally good. But for me the flavour was quite watery. I prefer a stronger flavour. If this was a dance, this ham would be a wallflower. He'd have no chance for a partner.

Judge four: I tend to agree. It's very moist which is reminiscent of ham that's been in the fridge for a while. It almost has a slight floral flavour. It has a very light flavour. It's almost pathetic ham.

Notes: good option for those who don't like a strong ham flavour.

Woolworths Gold Free Range Triple Smoked Leg Ham

Woolworth's ham is new to the Christmas range this year, and is created with sea salt and brown sugar, then triple smoked over beechwood.

Price: $14/kg

Judge one: Oh. Mmm. This ticks many ham boxes. This ham is moist and it's the only of the hams we've tried that has a sweetness. I think that's a crucial element. Perhaps the other hams are there for you to add to, in that they give you the bare ham bone. But this ham has done all the work for you. It presents beautifully and it's got the extra sweetness. It requires no dressing, glazing or sauce. It's just great eating ham.

Judge two: I second that sentiment entirely. This is a ham that lifts you up, it does. It's got a more complex flavour than the others and it's got a sweetness that isn't overpowering. This is an exciting ham.

Judge three: I'm comfortable in saying that this is a ham for the ages. It's got a lot of depth, it's got a lovely moistness, it's robust, it's got a good texture, and you wouldn't need to add anything to this, which is really important because you eat leftover ham by opening the fridge with a knife and carving bits off and throwing it into your gob. It needs to stand up by itself, and I think this one does.

Judge four: I think it's a unanimous -- or un-HAM-imous -- decision. This ham is exactly what ham should taste like. I like the smokiness at the back, and even the little bit of skin I got was just exactly how Christmas tastes. Lurpak, white bread and you'd be in heaven.

Notes: a flavoursome quality ham that doesn't require any glazing.

IGA Bone-In Leg Ham

According to IGA, this bone-in leg ham is an award-winning ham, having taken home the PorkMark Ham award multiple years in a row. It's an all Australian product that has been naturally beechwood smoked and cured.

Price: $7.99/kg

Judge one: Yeah, I like it. It's good. I think it's probably my second favourite. It's moist and has a good flavour.

Judge two: It's not sweet but has a good flavour. It's quite salty. It doesn't taste like really high quality ham, it tastes a bit processed.

Judge three: I actually think this is potentially the best. It doesn't have the sweetness but I kind of like that. I think good texture, moistness. Salty, definitely, but with a chutney -- mmm.

Judge four: I really like that. It's more salty than the other ones but I like the saltiness. And it's more moist. It's on par with the other best one. It's so delicious and salty.

Notes: a moist, tasty option for those who like saltier ham.

Reports of Nassar’s sex crimes “raise serious concerns about protecting athletes from abuse and mistreatment in organized sports,” House Commerce Committee Chair Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said Friday in a statement announcing the investigation. He called Nassar’s actions “abhorrent.”

A Michigan judge this week sentenced Nassar to 40 years to 175 years in prison for sexual assault. More than 140 women and girls, including multiple Olympic gymnasts, have come forward to accuse him of abusing them under the guise of medical treatment. Many said they brought their complaints to USA Gymnastics or Michigan State University, where Nassar also worked, but were silenced or ignored.

The House investigation also will include taekwondo and swimming, as athletes of both sports have alleged sexual misconduct and a lack of oversight from the respective governing bodies.

“These organizations must have mechanisms in place to ensure complete oversight and prevent such abuses from occurring,” Walden said. “As we move forward in gathering the facts, this committee intends to hold a hearing in order to investigate these critical issues further.”

The committee also sent an inquiry to Michigan State University.

Nassar’s crimes have forced recent resignations from several top officials at USA Gymnastics and MSU, including the university president and athletic director. The remaining members of USA Gymnastics’ board resigned on Friday afternoon, after the U.S. Olympic Committee threatened the previous day to strip its certification as the sport’s governing body if the entire board did not resign.

Members of Michigan’s congressional delegation who serve on the Commerce Committee earlier called on its leaders to investigate the USOC, USA Gymnastics and MSU.

Senate lawmakers have also sought to address Nassar’s serial crimes, and the broader issue of sexual abuse in sports.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Tuesday plans to hold an event with several of Nassar’s victims, including Rachael Denhollander, the first gymnast to publicly accuse him of assault.

Feinstein plans to demand a House vote on legislation requiring sports governing bodies to immediately report sexual abuse claims to law enforcement officials. The Senate passed the legislation in November.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) requested earlier this week that the Senate establish a select committee to investigate the role of USA Gymnastics and the USOC, before the Winter Olympics begin on Feb. 9.

“The fact is, the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics have shown they can’t police themselves. Somebody needs to be held accountable,” Shaheen said Friday on MSNBC. “Now, Larry Nassar got his due in court, and I think that is very important. But there are a lot of other people involved, and the questions continue about ‘why did this go on for so long?’”-1

HANNITY at 9:55pm: "Yeah maybe Donald Trump wanted to fire the special counsel for conflict. Does he not have the right to raise those questions? You know, we'll deal with this tomorrow night." pic.twitter.com/CKvYqsNwR1

Sean Hannity on Thursday night was forced to backtrack on his own show as Fox News confirmed a New York Times report he had just attacked.

Earlier in his show, Hannity blasted a report that said President Donald Trump had tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller last year and accused the Times of “trying to distract you.”

“Our sources, and I’ve checked in with many of them, they’re not confirming that tonight,” he said. “And how many times has the New York Times and others gotten it wrong?”

By the end of the show, he was forced to admit that Fox News had confirmed the Times report.

His response?

First he said the president has the right to “raise those questions” about conflicts of interest without actually addressing Trump’s reported attempt to fire Mueller, promising to deal with it tomorrow.

Then, the man who had earlier in the show accused the Times of distraction quickly switched to footage of a police chase and car crash.0
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-poor-black-neighborhood-air-pollution_us_5a663a67e4b0e5630072746e?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009Even Breathing Is A Risk In One Of Orlando's Poorest NeighborhoodsORLANDO, Fla. ― During the 15 years that Jacqueline Young lived in Griffin Park, a federal housing project, she always worried about the air that she and her granddaughter were breathing.

On bad days, her throat would hurt, and her granddaughter would have violent asthma attacks. Young, who often walked neighborhood kids to and from school, noticed that many of the children wore masks to protect themselves from pollution.

The air inside wasn’t much better. The decrepit air-conditioning unit in Young’s apartment spewed out dust and forced her to keep the windows open, even when traffic was heavy. Sometimes, soot and particles floated through the air inside her apartment “like it was snowing dust,” said Young. “We could never not think of the air we were breathing,” she said.

She finally moved out last year, a refugee from the air itself.

Griffin Park is surrounded by two major highways that are used by hundreds of thousands of cars heading in and out of Orlando, Florida, every day. Whatever trees once buffered the noxious fumes and the roar of cars on all sides have been cut down. From above, you see a grid of apartment buildings encircled menacingly within a loop of the interchange, as if inside a noose.

The pollution in Griffin Park and its low-income Parramore neighborhood is violence of a kind Americans tend to ignore. But it is as deliberate and as politically determined as any more recognizable act of racial violence. What happened to Griffin Park was the sum of a series of choices made over the course of a century, the effect of which was to transmute formal segregation into the very air certain people breathe.

Although air pollution has generally decreased in the United States since the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, it still causes 200,000 early deaths each year. Men, poor people and African-Americans are disproportionately at risk. According to a comprehensive Harvard University study last year of air pollution in the U.S., black people are about three times more likely to die from exposure to airborne pollutants than others.

The study also concluded that many of these deaths could be prevented if the federally mandated air quality standards were tightened. Reducing current levels of so-called fine particulate matter by just one microgram per cubic meter of air would save about 12,000 lives every year, the scientists found.

But rather than making environmental standards more stringent, the Trump administration is moving to scrap a number of regulations and has proposed cutting the Environmental Protection Agency budget by almost one-third. The administration also collected 60 percent less in civil penalties from polluters through July 31, 2017, than any of the previous three administrations had collected during a similar time frame, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.

“They are not following science in the way they should,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in reference to the Trump administration. “They’re going in the opposite direction.”

The Harvard study didn’t look into why black people might be more vulnerable to fine particulate matter. Dominici, the lead scientist, said other research suggests that less access to health care and higher rates of health problems in general can increase the mortality rates within communities of color.

But the potential culprit isn’t hard to identify. Last year, a federally funded study found that people of color were exposed to more transportation-related pollution than white people. While the study itself didn’t identify the underlying causes, the senior author pointed to racial residential patterns, whereby low-income black people are more likely than whites to live near sources of pollution such as highways.

Segregation persists, entrenched through housing and zoning policy and through the construction of urban expressways that literally turned existing racial borders to concrete. This was not an unintended consequence; this was the whole point. As highway lobbyist Alfred Johnson later told an interviewer, some city officials in the mid-1950s were blunt about the goals of highway planning: “Urban Interstates would give them a good opportunity to get rid of the local ‘niggertown.’”

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Backyards in the Griffin Park housing project look directly out at a highway.

Founded in the early 1880s, Parramore was once a bustling middle-class community full of black-owned homes, schools, businesses, churches and hotels. And it thrived well into the mid-20th century ― even as black people were violently blocked from political power in Orlando and elsewhere in the country.

Following Reconstruction, railroad systems were built around black neighborhoods across the country as a means of segregation. The railroad tracks divided Orlando into a black westside, including Parramore, and a predominantly white eastern corridor.

In 1938, the city demolished housing in Jonestown, the first black neighborhood in Orlando, and two years later relocated a majority of the residents to the new Griffin Park project. When Interstate 4 was constructed almost two decades after that, it followed the route of the railroad tracks and further severed the Parramore community from the rest of the city, while exposing the former’s black residents to even higher levels of pollution.

Today, I-4, State Road 408 and various ramps form the loop that encapsulates Griffin Park within an “oval of pollution,” said Robert Cassanello, a history professor at the University of Central Florida. “The developments, and the plans to revitalize the city, were at the cost and risk of African-American residents.”

The child poverty rate in Parramore is 73 percent and the median annual household income is $13,613. Many lots are vacant and overgrown, and most of the existing housing is considered substandard by today’s construction standards, according to a city assessment.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Marita Wilson, who is often troubled by asthma, walks to her home in Griffin Park.

“If I had money, I’d live in another place,” said Marita Wilson, whose apartment in Griffin Park is often covered with a thin layer of dust when she wakes up in the morning. The 70-year-old woman is often troubled by asthma and severe allergies, which she believes are exacerbated by the fumes and the dust from the traffic right outside her windows.

People in Griffin Park and the wider community of Parramore say they have tried in vain to get officials to focus on the air pollution and other environmental problems they fear are creating health problems for residents.

“Too many people I know have cancer. Too many people I know have respiratory problems. Too many people I know don’t have the proper information to know how to diagnosis what’s going on,” said Lawanna Gelzer, a community activist. “I get upset a lot. I’m David and I have a slingshot and a rock. And Goliath is my government, my elected officials, with billions of dollars to fight me.”

City officials say they are working on conducting a health assessment of the community sometime in the next five years as part of a beautification project in the area. The plan aims to “transform” Parramore into one of the healthiest neighborhoods in the city and to make following a healthy lifestyle simpler by building a Parramore farmers market, community gardens and a bike path.

Courtesy Jacqueline Young Dust emitted from the air-conditioning unit in Jacqueline Young's apartment in Griffin Park.

Jacqueline Young is a U.S. Air Force veteran whose granddaughter Lynette lived with her for years. She believes Lynette’s asthma and severe allergies were worsened by the neighborhood’s poor air quality. Lynette used nebulizers to ward off attacks that were sometimes so severe the girl had to be hospitalized to have air pumped into her lungs. Doctors couldn’t explain why Lynette’s asthma was getting worse, Young said.

Many adults living in Griffin Park suffered from asthma and other respiratory problems as well, she said. The paramedics maintained a presence at the public housing complex. “Not for shootings but for health issues,” said Young. “There’s always somebody in the ambulance.”

A 2016 assessment by the state Department of Health’s Orange County office found that carbon dioxide levels inside Young’s apartment were more than three times higher than those measured outside the apartment, falling into the EPA range of “unhealthy for sensitive groups” ― such as children, the elderly and asthmatics like Lynette.

The assessment also found “an excessive amount of dust in the A/C return area.” Young was advised by the Health Department to open her windows and clean her apartment. But she said the Orlando Housing Authority gave her the opposite advice, warning her against keeping the windows open.

Young, whose fight with the housing authority was covered locally, said it took eight years for her A/C unit to be fully operable following its installation in 2007. A spokeswoman for the housing authority said it tried to address Young’s claims by fixing the A/C unit each time Young put in a request ― at least 17 in all between 2011 and 2017, according to agency documents. The housing authority said that, on average, those repairs were taken care of within a week.

Emails to officials show Young seeking answers from various officials about the dust in her home — from the Florida Department of Transportation, from the Orange County Environmental Protection Division, from the Florida Asthma Coalition, from the Orlando Housing Authority. The responses, if they came at all, were unhelpful.

David Lohr/Chris McGonigal/HuffPost State Road 408 and Interstate 4 completely surround Griffin Park.

While indoor air pollution is considered a serious health threat, residents in Parramore also worry about the air quality outside.

The Health Department’s Orange County office tested the air quality in three separate outdoor locations in Parramore in 2014 and didn’t find elevated pollution levels. The researchers suggested that further testing be done since wind and other factors can produce unreliable results. But no additional outdoor study has been conducted since then because the office only conducts air quality tests upon request.

Doug Brugge, a professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University who studies the connection between traffic and health issues, criticized that 2014 assessment. Griffin Park is unique in that the highways wrap completely around it, Brugge said. “That really stands out.”

The study also “missed the point about traffic pollution,” he said. It didn’t measure the most relevant form of such pollution – the ultrafine particles and black carbon that are often present in the air near major roadways.

“It’s very frustrating how often we see people doing the wrong measurements near the highway,” Brugge said, adding that research shows that living near major roadways is associated with cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological effects.

When contacted for comment, Orlando city officials referred HuffPost’s air quality questions to the Health Department’s Orange County office, the state Transportation Department and the Orlando Housing Authority. The Health Department office declined to comment on Brugge’s criticism of the study and the dust issue in Griffin Park, but referred HuffPost to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The latter agency said that ozone and particulate matter levels in the area are within the “good” and “moderate” ranges of the EPA’s Air Quality Index. (The air monitor is about seven miles south of the housing project.)

The Orange County Environmental Protection Division measured the air quality at a site in Parramore for a year ― from July 1, 2016, through June 28, 2017 ― and found the ozone and particulate matter levels in that area to be within the “good” and “moderate” ranges of the Air Quality Index as well, according to a department spokesperson.

But the data, according to Brugge, don’t actually say anything about the air quality in Griffin Park. The measurements are based on a limited number of monitors, and while the EPA’s index is useful, Brugge said it is hardly definitive. The index doesn’t disclose which pollutants are driving the day’s air quality and it doesn’t take into consideration pollutants that are not part of the index. It’s not designed to assess near-highway environments, he said. And the EPA doesn’t include ultrafine particles, the most adverse for health, in its index because they’re not a federally regulated pollutant.

“Their air monitor seven miles away does not tell you that there are no problems at that housing development,” said Brugge. “I’m a scientist. I always qualify things. But that’s an unambiguous point.”

Orlando plans to do its own health disparity study as part of the beautification project known as the Parramore Comprehensive Neighborhood Plan. “As a short-term recommendation the goal is to begin this assessment within 5 years. Staff is currently in the early stages pursuing funding opportunities,” the city said in a statement to HuffPost.

But existing data already suggest that, in an area considered medically underserved, 41 percent of children suffer from chronic health issues. And residents say they don’t need to wait up to five years to know there’s a problem.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Lawanna Gelzer, an environmental justice activist, tours the Parramore neighborhood in her car.

Gelzer, the environmental justice activist, has been sounding the alarm about air quality for years. She organizes rallies, attends city council meetings and tries to help people in the community by giving them the information they need.

The 55-year-old, who operates a daycare center with her mother, does what she can to protect those kids, many of whom suffer from asthma and other severe respiratory problems. Some days, she keeps the children inside because she is concerned about the levels of air pollution. But that’s just a small bandage on a huge problem.

Gelzer first became aware of serious pollution in the neighborhood in 2013 when she learned about a Superfund site, the former Orlando Gasification Plant. She suspected that this, along with the exhaust from the cars on the freeway, was making her community’s respiratory and other health issues worse.

Remediation at the Superfund site is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of this year, a city spokesperson told HuffPost. (TECO Peoples Gas, a natural gas provider that now occupies the site, is not one of the companies currently tasked with cleaning it up.) But the old gasification plant isn’t the neighborhood’s only trouble spot. There are at least 454 contaminated lots in Parramore, according to a 2013 EPA grant application from the city of Orlando seeking clean-up funds.

When Gelzer reached out to the city to learn about pollution in Parramore that year, she was given a black-and-white map from the grant application. She thinks the people in the community need more detailed information than that.

“How would I be able to determine what health issues I should be dealing with based on this map?” Gelzer said. “We’ve been assured that we’re not at risk, but who’s assuring us? The same people who allowed this to happen to our community.”

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Allen and Latoya Lee talk on the porch of their Parramore home in November 2017.

As Gelzer has found, pollution in Parramore is a political matter just as surely as it is an environmental one.

In 2015, Latoya Lee and her family moved from their home beside Gelzer’s daycare center to a small house on Robinson Street, about a mile north of Griffin Park and right next to the neighborhood’s Superfund site, where lethal chemicals such as benzene, naphthalene, coal tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons had leaked into the ground.

People who live near the former gasification plant have long been concerned about respiratory problems like asthma as well as other health risks associated with the exposed dust, vapors and smells that may spread during the Superfund clean-up process.

The Lees were certainly worried. A 2016 public health assessment from the Health Department had concluded that current contaminants were likely below harmful levels, but still the couple was skeptical.

Latoya had been in and out of the hospital since 2012 for issues related to troubled breathing, but her health quickly worsened in their new home. Her bronchial asthma and sleep apnea got worse. She had three major surgeries due to her longstanding respiratory problems ― two of them tracheostomies.

Sometimes, waking up in the morning, she couldn’t breathe or even walk the short distance to the bathroom. She was using the inhaler more and taking more medication. “I’m to the point where I’m using more oxygen than I did before,” she said, during an interview in November. She was sitting on her porch wearing a pink turban, flanked by her oxygen tank. “It wasn’t as bad when we were two or three blocks over.”

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost This TECO gas plant sits atop a Superfund site near the Lees' home in the Parramore neighborhood.

Allen, her husband, believed that the air quality was worse in the new location and decided to move his family into a subdivision about 20 minutes away from Robinson Street. “I’ve been in there and just sat in there. I could breathe fine,” Latoya said. “I’m not short of breath, none of that. And I’ve actually noticed that the last two times that I’ve left here and gone to the new house, so it’s a lot going on with the air around here. It’s a lot.”

But on Dec. 6, as the Lees were moving into their new home and their children were getting dressed for school, Allen woke up to his daughter screaming that her mother had stopped breathing. Latoya had died from cardiac arrest.

Gelzer fears her friend is not “the only one who has passed because of this.”

“The most vulnerable part of our population is dealing with something that’s hazardous to their health,” she said. “When you look at the people ― a community of color ― and you look at the economics of the community, and how people are treated, I just don’t think this would happen anywhere else.”-1

On Thursday, the 33-year-old got real with her followers and tweeted about seeing a little more cellulite on her legs now that she’s almost seven months pregnant.

I now have cellulite on my legs! Cute! Cute! "Pregnancy may make cellulite look worse for a while, because the weight that you gain in pregnancy could make it more noticeable." — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

I feel like I've always had cellulite but it's way more prominent at the moment 🤦🏼‍♀️ — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

Kardashian also tweeted about not having stretch marks yet, which she joked was one of “the perks of being chubby previously.”

So far no stretch marks. So I'm happy about that 🤞🏽 the perks of being chubby previously. Lol my tummy knows how to stretch — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

A blogger known as Carmen ― who runs the site “A Side of Crunchy” ― took issue with the reality star’s remark. She tweeted that more celebrities should “embrace pregnancy” and her cellulite.

Stretch marks are tiger stripes you earn as a mom. I wish celebrities would embrace pregnancy 🤰 and not worry about their body image. Do you want to see what a real body of a mother of four looks like? — A Side of Crunchy (@asideofcrunchy) January 26, 2018

Embrace it you wanted a baby! — A Side of Crunchy (@asideofcrunchy) January 26, 2018

Khloe, who’s more than experienced in dealing with Twitter hate, sweetly shot down claims that she isn’t enjoying ― or embracing ― being pregnant.

How do you know that I'm not embracing it? I am enjoying every moment! I love it all. My body is a real body just as yours is. Everywoman has different shapes and sizes. That's the beauty of us being women — Khloé (@khloekardashian) January 26, 2018

This isn’t the first time the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has fought back against people criticizing her for something during her pregnancy.

Previously, some on social media weren’t happy when Kardashian shared her pregnancy workouts on Snapchat and said it would hurt the baby.

I don’t understand why @khloekardashian is doing sport while she is pregnant.. It can cause some trauma for this little baby 😭😭 — M. Fouineur (@SaamStylee) December 27, 2017

On bad days, her throat would hurt, and her granddaughter would have violent asthma attacks. Young, who often walked neighborhood kids to and from school, noticed that many of the children wore masks to protect themselves from pollution.

The air inside wasn’t much better. The decrepit air-conditioning unit in Young’s apartment spewed out dust and forced her to keep the windows open, even when traffic was heavy. Sometimes, soot and particles floated through the air inside her apartment “like it was snowing dust,” said Young. “We could never not think of the air we were breathing,” she said.

She finally moved out last year, a refugee from the air itself.

Griffin Park is surrounded by two major highways that are used by hundreds of thousands of cars heading in and out of Orlando, Florida, every day. Whatever trees once buffered the noxious fumes and the roar of cars on all sides have been cut down. From above, you see a grid of apartment buildings encircled menacingly within a loop of the interchange, as if inside a noose.

The pollution in Griffin Park and its low-income Parramore neighborhood is violence of a kind Americans tend to ignore. But it is as deliberate and as politically determined as any more recognizable act of racial violence. What happened to Griffin Park was the sum of a series of choices made over the course of a century, the effect of which was to transmute formal segregation into the very air certain people breathe.

Although air pollution has generally decreased in the United States since the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, it still causes 200,000 early deaths each year. Men, poor people and African-Americans are disproportionately at risk. According to a comprehensive Harvard University study last year of air pollution in the U.S., black people are about three times more likely to die from exposure to airborne pollutants than others.

The study also concluded that many of these deaths could be prevented if the federally mandated air quality standards were tightened. Reducing current levels of so-called fine particulate matter by just one microgram per cubic meter of air would save about 12,000 lives every year, the scientists found.

But rather than making environmental standards more stringent, the Trump administration is moving to scrap a number of regulations and has proposed cutting the Environmental Protection Agency budget by almost one-third. The administration also collected 60 percent less in civil penalties from polluters through July 31, 2017, than any of the previous three administrations had collected during a similar time frame, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.

“They are not following science in the way they should,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in reference to the Trump administration. “They’re going in the opposite direction.”

The Harvard study didn’t look into why black people might be more vulnerable to fine particulate matter. Dominici, the lead scientist, said other research suggests that less access to health care and higher rates of health problems in general can increase the mortality rates within communities of color.

But the potential culprit isn’t hard to identify. Last year, a federally funded study found that people of color were exposed to more transportation-related pollution than white people. While the study itself didn’t identify the underlying causes, the senior author pointed to racial residential patterns, whereby low-income black people are more likely than whites to live near sources of pollution such as highways.

Segregation persists, entrenched through housing and zoning policy and through the construction of urban expressways that literally turned existing racial borders to concrete. This was not an unintended consequence; this was the whole point. As highway lobbyist Alfred Johnson later told an interviewer, some city officials in the mid-1950s were blunt about the goals of highway planning: “Urban Interstates would give them a good opportunity to get rid of the local ‘niggertown.’”

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Backyards in the Griffin Park housing project look directly out at a highway.

Founded in the early 1880s, Parramore was once a bustling middle-class community full of black-owned homes, schools, businesses, churches and hotels. And it thrived well into the mid-20th century ― even as black people were violently blocked from political power in Orlando and elsewhere in the country.

Following Reconstruction, railroad systems were built around black neighborhoods across the country as a means of segregation. The railroad tracks divided Orlando into a black westside, including Parramore, and a predominantly white eastern corridor.

In 1938, the city demolished housing in Jonestown, the first black neighborhood in Orlando, and two years later relocated a majority of the residents to the new Griffin Park project. When Interstate 4 was constructed almost two decades after that, it followed the route of the railroad tracks and further severed the Parramore community from the rest of the city, while exposing the former’s black residents to even higher levels of pollution.

Today, I-4, State Road 408 and various ramps form the loop that encapsulates Griffin Park within an “oval of pollution,” said Robert Cassanello, a history professor at the University of Central Florida. “The developments, and the plans to revitalize the city, were at the cost and risk of African-American residents.”

The child poverty rate in Parramore is 73 percent and the median annual household income is $13,613. Many lots are vacant and overgrown, and most of the existing housing is considered substandard by today’s construction standards, according to a city assessment.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Marita Wilson, who is often troubled by asthma, walks to her home in Griffin Park.

“If I had money, I’d live in another place,” said Marita Wilson, whose apartment in Griffin Park is often covered with a thin layer of dust when she wakes up in the morning. The 70-year-old woman is often troubled by asthma and severe allergies, which she believes are exacerbated by the fumes and the dust from the traffic right outside her windows.

People in Griffin Park and the wider community of Parramore say they have tried in vain to get officials to focus on the air pollution and other environmental problems they fear are creating health problems for residents.

“Too many people I know have cancer. Too many people I know have respiratory problems. Too many people I know don’t have the proper information to know how to diagnosis what’s going on,” said Lawanna Gelzer, a community activist. “I get upset a lot. I’m David and I have a slingshot and a rock. And Goliath is my government, my elected officials, with billions of dollars to fight me.”

City officials say they are working on conducting a health assessment of the community sometime in the next five years as part of a beautification project in the area. The plan aims to “transform” Parramore into one of the healthiest neighborhoods in the city and to make following a healthy lifestyle simpler by building a Parramore farmers market, community gardens and a bike path.

Courtesy Jacqueline Young Dust emitted from the air-conditioning unit in Jacqueline Young's apartment in Griffin Park.

Jacqueline Young is a U.S. Air Force veteran whose granddaughter Lynette lived with her for years. She believes Lynette’s asthma and severe allergies were worsened by the neighborhood’s poor air quality. Lynette used nebulizers to ward off attacks that were sometimes so severe the girl had to be hospitalized to have air pumped into her lungs. Doctors couldn’t explain why Lynette’s asthma was getting worse, Young said.

Many adults living in Griffin Park suffered from asthma and other respiratory problems as well, she said. The paramedics maintained a presence at the public housing complex. “Not for shootings but for health issues,” said Young. “There’s always somebody in the ambulance.”

A 2016 assessment by the state Department of Health’s Orange County office found that carbon dioxide levels inside Young’s apartment were more than three times higher than those measured outside the apartment, falling into the EPA range of “unhealthy for sensitive groups” ― such as children, the elderly and asthmatics like Lynette.

The assessment also found “an excessive amount of dust in the A/C return area.” Young was advised by the Health Department to open her windows and clean her apartment. But she said the Orlando Housing Authority gave her the opposite advice, warning her against keeping the windows open.

Young, whose fight with the housing authority was covered locally, said it took eight years for her A/C unit to be fully operable following its installation in 2007. A spokeswoman for the housing authority said it tried to address Young’s claims by fixing the A/C unit each time Young put in a request ― at least 17 in all between 2011 and 2017, according to agency documents. The housing authority said that, on average, those repairs were taken care of within a week.

Emails to officials show Young seeking answers from various officials about the dust in her home — from the Florida Department of Transportation, from the Orange County Environmental Protection Division, from the Florida Asthma Coalition, from the Orlando Housing Authority. The responses, if they came at all, were unhelpful.

David Lohr/Chris McGonigal/HuffPost State Road 408 and Interstate 4 completely surround Griffin Park.

While indoor air pollution is considered a serious health threat, residents in Parramore also worry about the air quality outside.

The Health Department’s Orange County office tested the air quality in three separate outdoor locations in Parramore in 2014 and didn’t find elevated pollution levels. The researchers suggested that further testing be done since wind and other factors can produce unreliable results. But no additional outdoor study has been conducted since then because the office only conducts air quality tests upon request.

Doug Brugge, a professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University who studies the connection between traffic and health issues, criticized that 2014 assessment. Griffin Park is unique in that the highways wrap completely around it, Brugge said. “That really stands out.”

The study also “missed the point about traffic pollution,” he said. It didn’t measure the most relevant form of such pollution – the ultrafine particles and black carbon that are often present in the air near major roadways.

“It’s very frustrating how often we see people doing the wrong measurements near the highway,” Brugge said, adding that research shows that living near major roadways is associated with cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological effects.

When contacted for comment, Orlando city officials referred HuffPost’s air quality questions to the Health Department’s Orange County office, the state Transportation Department and the Orlando Housing Authority. The Health Department office declined to comment on Brugge’s criticism of the study and the dust issue in Griffin Park, but referred HuffPost to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The latter agency said that ozone and particulate matter levels in the area are within the “good” and “moderate” ranges of the EPA’s Air Quality Index. (The air monitor is about seven miles south of the housing project.)

The Orange County Environmental Protection Division measured the air quality at a site in Parramore for a year ― from July 1, 2016, through June 28, 2017 ― and found the ozone and particulate matter levels in that area to be within the “good” and “moderate” ranges of the Air Quality Index as well, according to a department spokesperson.

But the data, according to Brugge, don’t actually say anything about the air quality in Griffin Park. The measurements are based on a limited number of monitors, and while the EPA’s index is useful, Brugge said it is hardly definitive. The index doesn’t disclose which pollutants are driving the day’s air quality and it doesn’t take into consideration pollutants that are not part of the index. It’s not designed to assess near-highway environments, he said. And the EPA doesn’t include ultrafine particles, the most adverse for health, in its index because they’re not a federally regulated pollutant.

“Their air monitor seven miles away does not tell you that there are no problems at that housing development,” said Brugge. “I’m a scientist. I always qualify things. But that’s an unambiguous point.”

Orlando plans to do its own health disparity study as part of the beautification project known as the Parramore Comprehensive Neighborhood Plan. “As a short-term recommendation the goal is to begin this assessment within 5 years. Staff is currently in the early stages pursuing funding opportunities,” the city said in a statement to HuffPost.

But existing data already suggest that, in an area considered medically underserved, 41 percent of children suffer from chronic health issues. And residents say they don’t need to wait up to five years to know there’s a problem.

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Lawanna Gelzer, an environmental justice activist, tours the Parramore neighborhood in her car.

Gelzer, the environmental justice activist, has been sounding the alarm about air quality for years. She organizes rallies, attends city council meetings and tries to help people in the community by giving them the information they need.

The 55-year-old, who operates a daycare center with her mother, does what she can to protect those kids, many of whom suffer from asthma and other severe respiratory problems. Some days, she keeps the children inside because she is concerned about the levels of air pollution. But that’s just a small bandage on a huge problem.

Gelzer first became aware of serious pollution in the neighborhood in 2013 when she learned about a Superfund site, the former Orlando Gasification Plant. She suspected that this, along with the exhaust from the cars on the freeway, was making her community’s respiratory and other health issues worse.

Remediation at the Superfund site is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of this year, a city spokesperson told HuffPost. (TECO Peoples Gas, a natural gas provider that now occupies the site, is not one of the companies currently tasked with cleaning it up.) But the old gasification plant isn’t the neighborhood’s only trouble spot. There are at least 454 contaminated lots in Parramore, according to a 2013 EPA grant application from the city of Orlando seeking clean-up funds.

When Gelzer reached out to the city to learn about pollution in Parramore that year, she was given a black-and-white map from the grant application. She thinks the people in the community need more detailed information than that.

“How would I be able to determine what health issues I should be dealing with based on this map?” Gelzer said. “We’ve been assured that we’re not at risk, but who’s assuring us? The same people who allowed this to happen to our community.”

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost Allen and Latoya Lee talk on the porch of their Parramore home in November 2017.

As Gelzer has found, pollution in Parramore is a political matter just as surely as it is an environmental one.

In 2015, Latoya Lee and her family moved from their home beside Gelzer’s daycare center to a small house on Robinson Street, about a mile north of Griffin Park and right next to the neighborhood’s Superfund site, where lethal chemicals such as benzene, naphthalene, coal tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons had leaked into the ground.

People who live near the former gasification plant have long been concerned about respiratory problems like asthma as well as other health risks associated with the exposed dust, vapors and smells that may spread during the Superfund clean-up process.

The Lees were certainly worried. A 2016 public health assessment from the Health Department had concluded that current contaminants were likely below harmful levels, but still the couple was skeptical.

Latoya had been in and out of the hospital since 2012 for issues related to troubled breathing, but her health quickly worsened in their new home. Her bronchial asthma and sleep apnea got worse. She had three major surgeries due to her longstanding respiratory problems ― two of them tracheostomies.

Sometimes, waking up in the morning, she couldn’t breathe or even walk the short distance to the bathroom. She was using the inhaler more and taking more medication. “I’m to the point where I’m using more oxygen than I did before,” she said, during an interview in November. She was sitting on her porch wearing a pink turban, flanked by her oxygen tank. “It wasn’t as bad when we were two or three blocks over.”

Chris McGonigal/HuffPost This TECO gas plant sits atop a Superfund site near the Lees' home in the Parramore neighborhood.

Allen, her husband, believed that the air quality was worse in the new location and decided to move his family into a subdivision about 20 minutes away from Robinson Street. “I’ve been in there and just sat in there. I could breathe fine,” Latoya said. “I’m not short of breath, none of that. And I’ve actually noticed that the last two times that I’ve left here and gone to the new house, so it’s a lot going on with the air around here. It’s a lot.”

But on Dec. 6, as the Lees were moving into their new home and their children were getting dressed for school, Allen woke up to his daughter screaming that her mother had stopped breathing. Latoya had died from cardiac arrest.

Gelzer fears her friend is not “the only one who has passed because of this.”

“The most vulnerable part of our population is dealing with something that’s hazardous to their health,” she said. “When you look at the people ― a community of color ― and you look at the economics of the community, and how people are treated, I just don’t think this would happen anywhere else.”-1

Residents swarmed local hospitals complaining of respiratory problems. Cricket players were forced to put on anti-pollution masks during a national match between India and Sri Lanka. And United Airlines canceled flights into the city, citing the air-quality concerns.

Air pollution isn’t among the causes of death that medical examiners list on death certificates, but the health conditions linked to air pollution exposure, such as lung cancer and emphysema, are often fatal. Air pollution was responsible for 6.1 million deaths and accounted for nearly 12 percent of the global death toll in 2016, the last year for which data was available, according the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times via Getty Images Heavy smog engulfed Gurgaon, India, a city southwest of New Delhi in North India. The air quality index was at 320, which agencies consider unfit for inhalation even by healthy people and which made commuting difficult. December 2017.

“Air pollution is one of the great killers of our age,” Philip Landrigan of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai wrote in an article published in the medical journal The Lancet.

India’s late environment minister, Anil Madhav Dave, made headlines last year for denying there was proof that air pollution was singularly responsible for death in India. Dave conceded that air pollution “could be one of the triggering factors for respiratory associated ailments and diseases,” but he blamed the negative health effects on other issues: poor diet, occupational hazards, socioeconomic status and genetics.

Dave died in May 2017 from cardiac arrest. The new environment minister, Harsh Vardhan, has also said that “to attribute any death to a cause like pollution, that may be too much.”

But there are numerous studies linking air pollution to morbidity around world.

“There is a huge amount of data linking outdoor and indoor air pollution with adverse health effects, including acute and chronic disease, exacerbations of chronic disease and death,” said Dr. Barry Levy, adjunct professor of public health at Tufts University School of Medicine.

The right to breathe is, you would think, the most fundamental right ― more than food, more than water. And that right is being seriously compromised right now. Mayur Sharma, TV personality

Of the 6.1 million air pollution death in 2016, 4.1 million are attributable to outdoor, or ambient, air pollution, according to IHME. Such pollution comes from sources like vehicles, coal-fired power plants and steel mills. Household, or indoor, air pollution is a more pressing problem in low-income countries due to the use of indoor fires for cooking and heat, and it’s linked to an estimated 2.6 million deaths per year. (In India at least, the total air pollution death rate has declined since 1990 even as the outdoor death rate went up in recent years ― due largely to a decrease in the number of deaths attributable to indoor air pollution. Scientists don’t completely understand how ambient and household air pollution deaths interact, and there’s some overlap between them, which is why the sum of ambient and household air pollution deaths exceeds total air pollution deaths.)

David Henry Montgomery/HuffPost

Developing countries bear the brunt of the world’s pollution problem

Air pollution is undoubtedly a global public health problem, but not all countries are equally affected.

As many as 1.6 million deaths were attributable to air pollution in India in 2016, according to IHME. That same year, all air pollution was linked to almost 123 out of every 100,000 deaths in the country ― among the highest in the world.

“When it comes to the number of deaths from air pollution, India is No. 1,” Landrigan told HuffPost.

Afghanistan and several African countries have higher ambient air pollution death rates than India, likely because of the extremely dusty conditions in those countries, combined with other pollution sources, like vehicle emissions and crop burning.

“With globalization, mining and manufacturing shifted to poorer countries, where environmental regulations and enforcement can be lax,” Karti Sandilya, one of the authors on the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, told Reuters. “People in poorer countries ― like construction workers in New Delhi ― are more exposed to air pollution and less able to protect themselves from exposure, as they walk, bike or ride the bus to workplaces that may also be polluted.”

Delhi has become a gas chamber. Every year this happens during this part of year. We have to find a soln to crop burning in adjoining states — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) November 7, 2017

North India’s topography makes its pollution problem worse, Vox noted in November. The region acts as a basin, trapping pollution from crop burning outside the city and mixing it with industrial pollution from within city limits. And that mix of pollution sources is most intense during the coldest months of the year.

In fact, the problem is getting so bad that some people are moving out of New Delhi altogether. Television personality Mayur Sharma is perhaps the most notable example: He left his job and moved his family out of the capital to escape the pollution.

“The right to breathe is, you would think, the most fundamental right ― more than food, more than water. And that right is being seriously compromised right now,” Sharma told NPR.

As India’s economy has expanded, the country has struggled to keep up with the environmental costs of that growth. Premature deaths from air pollution have stabilized in China, which rivals India in terms of pollution problems and population. That stabilization occurred partly because China has used fines and criminal charges to crack down on pollution. India’s government, however, seems more focused on economic growth than on protecting air quality and the environment.

Air pollution ― and climate change ― link the global community in deadly ways

Because air pollution and related health problems can travel, no country can solve its air pollution problem alone.

Air pollution from Chinese consumption was linked to an estimated 3,100 premature deaths in the U.S and Western Europe in 2007, according to an article published last year in the journal Nature. At the same time, nearly 110,000 premature deaths in China were linked to pollution prompted by consumption in the U.S. and Western European.

“Air pollution can travel long distances and cause health impacts in downwind regions,” Qiang Zhang, co-author of the article and a researcher at Tsinghua University in Beijing, explained to Popular Science.

Air pollution doesn’t care about political boundaries. Kirk Smith, professor of global environmental health at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health

Climate change will likely exacerbate those global concerns, according to public health experts. They anticipate that climate change will trigger a host of public health problems, including heat- and cold-related deaths, increased disease risk and mental health problems from climate displacement and extreme weather conditions. Climate change also contributes to air pollution trends ― hotter temperatures increase wildfire risk, and wildfires create ambient air pollution. It also increases ground-level ozone, which is a main ingredient in urban smog, and can trigger health problems like chest pain, throat irritation and lung inflammation, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. “Higher temperatures are expected to increase the rate of ozone formation,” Levy said. This makes it even more crucial for local, national and intergovernmental organizations to join forces to address air pollution.-1

Once upon a time, in the Pony Expresso cafe in Seattle, a man and a woman began to experience the long-mysterious but increasingly scientifically investigated thing we call love. The first stage is called "limerence." This is the spine-tingling, heart-twisting, can't-stop-staring feeling, when it seems as though the world stops whirling and time itself bows down and pauses before the force of your longing. The man, a then-44-year-old University of Washington research psychologist named John Gottman, was drawn to the woman's wild mane of black curly hair and her creativity: She was an amateur musician and painter as well as a psychologist like himself. The woman, a then-35-year-old named Julie Schwartz, who'd placed a personal ad in the Seattle Weekly that John had answered, was turned on by John's humble little car—voted the ugliest vehicle in the University of Washington faculty parking lot—and his expansive curiosity. He read physics and math and history and kept a little spiral-bound notebook in his pocket that he used to jot down things his companions said that captivated him. They talked avidly; it felt as if they'd known each other forever. Over the following months they drew closer and closer, proceeding through subsequent stages of building a fulfilling love relationship. John learned about the unhappy home life growing up in Michigan that had driven Julie to spend so much time in the forest by herself, and Julie learned about John's desire to understand deeply earth's biggest mysteries, like the nature of time. Although they were afraid—they'd both been divorced before—they confided their admiration for each other, John's for the courage Julie showed in her therapy practice by helping the “sickest of the sickest,” schizophrenics and Vietnam veterans on Skid Row, and Julie's for John's absurdist sense of humor. They kayaked together. They joined a synagogue. They married and had a daughter, fulfilling one of John's longtime dreams, and bought a house on a forested island three hours north of Seattle, fulfilling a dream of Julie's. They fought. They attended couples therapy. Through their conflict they came to love each other more. Twenty-nine years after that first date, John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman stood on a black stage in a ballroom of the Seattle Sheraton in front of about 250 other couples, young and old, straight and gay. The intense intimacy of their relationship was on full display: They finished each other's sentences, bantered with each other and talked candidly about how their struggles had made them stronger. Julie wept. John held Julie, caressing her hair. The rest of us, seated in chairs that had been hooked together in sets of twos, watched them with yearning. We'd come to see the Gottmans because the pair has spent the last 20 years refining a science-based method to build a beautiful love partnership yourself. They reveal it over a two-day, $750-per-pair workshop called "The Art and Science of Love." “It turns out Tolstoy was wrong," John told the crowd in an opening lecture. "All happy relationships are similar and all unhappy relationships are also similar. … Is there a secret? It turns out, empirically, yes, there is a secret." Over decades, John has observed more than 3,000 couples longitudinally, discovering patterns of argument and subtle behaviors that can predict whether a couple would be happily partnered years later or unhappy or divorced. He has won awards from the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Council of Family Relations and has become the subject of increasing public fascination. He went on Oprah and the “Today” show. A book he co-authored that summarizes his findings, Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, is a New York Times best-seller. His work took off because the consistency of his predictions is astonishing. One 1992 experiment found that certain indicators in how couples talked about their relationship could forecast–with 94 percent accuracy–which pairs would stay together. This was magic–a virtually foolproof way of distinguishing toxic partnerships from healthy ones even before the couples knew themselves–but it was also science, so it appealed to our contemporary desire to use empirical data to better our lives. Walk by any newsstand, or trawl the Internet for three minutes, and you’ll find data-driven methods to improve everything we do. “Is This the Ultimate Healthy Meal?” “The Best Workout Ever, According to Science.” You might expect love to be the last frontier breached by data. It is the Antarctic of the human experience, richly feeding the oceans of our emotions, yet somehow remaining elusive and unknown. Philosophers have argued over it for millennia without arriving at a satisfactory definition. Poets like Erich Fried capture its strange mix of pleasure and pain, the sense of its essential ungovernability: “It is foolish, says caution / It is impossible, says experience / It is what it is, says love.” I first encountered Gottman's research last year in an Atlantic article called "Masters of Love." It went viral; my own friends posted it on Facebook saying, "This is what it comes down to.” Finally, love had been harnessed in the laboratory, seen, understood and broken into building blocks we could all apply to our lives. The article proposes a recipe for becoming a love “master” instead of a love “disaster” by responding the right way to what Gottman calls your partner's "bids for connection.” A “bid” is when your lover points out your kitchen window and marvels, "Look at that beautiful bird outside!" You could go "Wow!” and get binoculars (an active “turn-towards”); mumble “Huh," and keep reading your newspaper (a passive reaction, less good); or say, "I'm sick of your fucking birds. What about the broken garage door?" Gottman found that masters turn towards their partners’ bids 87 percent of the time. Love, he concluded, comes down to "a habit of mind.” And habits of mind take work to instill. Everyone at the workshop was given a kit in a box with a handle. Inside were decks of cards proposing questions to help us learn about our partners (“how are you feeling now about being a mother?”) or offering ways to connect erotically (“when you return home tonight, greet each other with a kiss that lasts at least six seconds”). A manual provided us with a vocabulary to demystify and contain some of the scary things that go on in love: fights are "regrettable incidents," the things that make us feel good together are our “rituals of connection,” the dark inner chasms that regrettable incidents seem to reveal are our "enduring vulnerabilities." One of the Gottmans’ employees, Kendra Han, estimated that a quarter of the couples in attendance were the kind of ickily self-aware duos who try this kind of thing for "fun and enrichment" while the majority were in some state of "relational distress." The prevailing mood was a mix of hope and fragility. "This is already not going well," I overheard one woman say, laughing a little. "My husband’s late.” As I watched the Gottmans from my own seat two rows from the stage, I felt anxious, too. I had come with my own love problem to solve.

Some traditional Arab cultures believed that when you fall in love, your lover steals your liver. The ancient Chinese told their children that love could take out your heart. Romantic love, in older human cultures, was often something dark. It involved physical dissolution, the sense of falling apart. It made us act irrationally and tore a hole into the neatly woven fabric of our lives, beckoning us to step through it into a land of terrors. “You get lots of stories of getting tricked,” William Jankowiak, an anthropologist who has extensively studied love in folktales, told me. That’s why, for much of human history, the marriage historian Stephanie Coontz writes, people thought lifelong partnership was “too important” to be left up to love. Marriage was a business contract. Families used it to acquire lands, to create stable legacies on which their next generations could build. Love resisted these kinds of reasoned considerations. That all began to change in the West in the 1700s. The rise of wage labor freed young people from their families and gave them more autonomy to decide whom to marry. The Enlightenment put freedom of choice into vogue. The word “spinster” emerged, a pathetic figure compared to blissful women in love. John began to feel as if he could eavesdrop on a couple sitting across from him in a restaurant and get a pretty good sense of their chances of divorce. Simon May, a British philosopher who has studied the development of beliefs about love over two millennia of Western culture, suggests that we’ve placed vastly more importance on finding love since the retreat of Christianity and the rise of relativism. "Human love," he writes in his magisterial Love: A History, "is widely tasked with achieving what once only divine love was thought capable of: to be our ultimate source of meaning and happiness, and of power over suffering and disappointment." The grounding we used to find in devotion to ideals like nationalism or communism, or in our faith in an ever-caring Shepherd, we now seek from individual, fickle human beings. After I read May’s theory that love “is now the West’s undeclared religion,” I began to see evidence of it everywhere. “When you get down to it … [love is] the only purpose grand enough for a human life,” writes Sue Monk Kidd in The Secret Life of Bees. At funerals, we praise the way the deceased person loved as the ultimate sign that his life had meaning. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his Supreme Court opinion legalizing gay marriage nationally, identified marriage as the ultimate wellspring of all the other essential human joys, from “expression” to “spirituality,” while Sheryl Sandberg counsels young women that their choice of a mate is the most important decision of their lives. According to May, we no longer view love as "the rarest of exceptions," as older cultures did, "but as a possibility open to practically all who have faith in it." These expectations are crazy-making, and it’s no wonder scientists have jumped in to try to save us. In the 1930s, sociologists began to generate charts to try to predict what kinds of love marriages would last a lifetime. You could take your own personality traits—loves sewing circles?—and plot them against your beau’s to forecast the happiness and stability of your match. 1 1 One of the first of these charts, created by Ernest Burgess in a book called Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage, borrowed the variables from studies on whether criminals relapsed after being let out of prison. Starting the ’70s, with divorce on the rise, social psychologists got into the mix. Recognizing the apparently opaque character of marital happiness but optimistic about science’s capacity to investigate it, they pioneered a huge array of inventive techniques to study what things seemed to make marriages succeed or fail. They had partners write down everything they hated or loved about each other and then studied how close the pair subsequently sat together on a couch. They even generated fights, instructing couples to argue over how to pack the car for a vacation while each partner twiddled dials under the laboratory table assessing their mate’s helpfulness. One study showed that couples who did novel things together fared better; another revealed that intense emotions, once believed to be a sign of immaturity in love, could be worked with to create very deep intimacy. Given how central our love partner had become to our well-being—research had begun to show a good marriage was more predictive of long-term health than eating right or not smoking—Sue Johnson of the Ottawa Couple and Family Institute told me she felt like she was “in the most exciting revolution that’s happened in the 20th century for human beings.” “Imagine proving all those poets and philosophers from way back wrong!” she said. “Finally, we can make sense of love and actually shape it with deliberation.”

One recent afternoon, the Gottmans met me in their downtown Seattle office to talk about John’s research and how they turned it into the Gottman Method. Julie was wearing a turqoise shirt and big earrings, her thick black curls streaked with a Susan Sontag ribbon of white. John, smaller and eagle-nosed, wore a black jacket and a yarmulke over a fringe of white hair. He'd brought his omnipresent scratch pad with him. "A few years after we'd married,” John began, “I wanted to leave for Chicago to take a job there. But Julie felt Chicago was too flat. And then we were in that canoe—" Julie interrupted him sharply. "Well, that came a bit later," she said. "The real story here is we decided to offer a parenting support group. Remember that?" "Oh, yeah," John deferred. "I forgot about that." Seeing the Gottmans' marital interaction up close is almost alarming at first. Most couples tone down the perpetual spats, adjustments, sideways glances and hopeful asides that constitute one-on-one intimacy when they're in public. The Gottmans don't. Sitting across from them at a conference table, you feel as though you’ve come upon them tucked into bed, working it out with each other. They exchange constant meaningful looks. They interrupt each other, or Julie mostly interrupts John, correcting his behavior and memory. John accepts it. They use couples-therapy language. ("Boundaries!" Julie reminds John, when he starts speaking about his ex-wife.) They openly refer to deep wounds in their relationship. They also snuggle. John puts his arm around Julie, she arches into him and they wrinkle their noses at each other. In my presence, Julie wept twice, once recounting a time John had made her feel like a bad mother and once when John said she had been “the answer to my prayers.” They started their parenting support group in 1989–just 10 couples, once a week, talking about the ups and downs of having children at the Seattle Jewish Community Center. John approached it like a lab. “He was all about observing and learning,” Julie said. “And I would jump in and talk about their emotions, looking for ways to try to help these parents. We'd have these great discussions afterwards and laugh about it. 'Why are you trying to help these people?' John would say. And I'd say, 'Honey, why are you not trying to help?'" When John got his start researching couples in the mid-1970s, he was the one who needed help. He’d grown up in Brooklyn and New Jersey a diminutive nerd with few friends. As an adult, his love life felt perpetually unstable and unhappy. He found it hard to be satisfied with the woman he was with. In one two-year relationship, he and a girlfriend argued so much he ended up with stress-induced pneumonia. Psychology, which he studied at the University of Wisconsin, gave him a way to use his problem-solving mind to attack the question of his own loneliness. Like a science-fiction android who pins electrodes on his human subjects to try to figure out where their emotions come from, John set about creating experiments that were as broad as possible: What does a good relationship look like? What does it feel like to be in it? His career took off when he met a psychologist named Robert Levenson. Each man turned out to be exactly what the other had needed. Levenson was investigating the remarkable variance in how different people react to stress by testing their heart rates and sweat-gland activity after receiving a jolt. By teaming up with John, he says he finally felt as if he was working on something more “personally relevant and emotionally rich” than administering electric shocks. Meanwhile, by joining with Levenson, John thought he might uncover a way to measure marital happiness that was more “real” than people’s self-reporting on surveys. Their collaboration led John to create an actual mock apartment where couples could do “ordinary” things like cook and watch TV together. “It was just like being at a bed and breakfast,” he said, “except you were hooked up to electrodes … and there were surveillance cameras hanging from the ceiling.” Then, he harnessed the emerging power of computers to analyze a vast amount of data from the interactions. Professionals trained in interpreting facial expressions evaluated hours of video, rating the couples for emotions like delight, disgust and fear; assistants coded questionnaires the partners filled out about their relationship history for positive and negative feelings; and machines took constant measures of the couples’ heart rates and vascular tone while they flirted and fought. Years afterwards, the psychologists followed up to see which couples were happy and which had split up. They plugged that information into a computer, along with all the data they’d previously gathered, and asked the machine to create equations that associated certain behaviors and physiology with long-term happiness. What emerged were fascinating and often surprising observations on lasting love. They found that couples that stay happy used a lot of “we,” whereas couples that turned out unhappy used “I,” “me” and “mine.” They also discovered that when partners with a good long-term outlook argued, they somehow managed to maintain a ratio of five positive comments to one negative one. “At the time, everybody was enamored with this idea that romantic relationships were full of fireworks,” Levenson remembered. “Well, that was not the finding. It is the capacity of couples to calm down, to soothe, to sort of reduce the level of arousal for each other, that is the most important factor in predicting whether the marriage will last.” In the beginning, the two men’s techniques were viewed as dangerously iconoclastic. “When Bob and I were assistant professors getting evaluated for tenure our committee said, ‘Look, you guys are crazy. We can’t predict one person’s behavior. How are we going to predict two people’s behavior? You’ll never find anything. You’ll never get a grant,’” John recalled. But as the astoundingly robust predictions started rolling in, all that changed. John got elected to chair the family psychology research unit of the American Psychological Association. The New York Times profiled his findings. Where John had once felt hopelessly bewildered by love, he began to feel as if he could eavesdrop on a couple sitting across from him in a restaurant and get a pretty good sense of their chances of divorce. “John had these brilliant insights,” Julie told me, “but nothing was being done with them.”

Unlike John, Julie’s work as a psychologist had centered on therapeutic interventions. The daughter of a severely emotionally unstable mother, Julie started comforting others early. “In high school, I didn’t have friends,” she said. “I had a caseload.” She specialized in individual and group therapy, not couples therapy, but she was fascinated by her husband’s research. She also knew that the majority of people who seek individual therapy want help with their relationships. From her divorce, she was familiar with the anguish produced by difficult love. She left that marriage with nothing but a Tibetan prayer rug, a sleeping bag and a cat. Canoeing together on the Salish Sea outside Seattle, Julie remembers saying to John, “Why don’t we try to help couples with what you know?” They spent the next year creating a master theory of good relationships based on John’s research. He sat in his red chair, she sat on an ottoman. “We argued a lot,” John remembered. “Oh, God, we argued a lot,” Julie said. In the beginning, John was hesitant to embrace some of the ideas about love that Julie had picked up from her decades of practice as a therapist. “I thought, if there wasn’t solid evidence, we wouldn’t put it into the theory,” he recalled. Always formula-driven, he imagined the Gottman Method would comprise a rigid set of 14 well-structured sessions. Julie wanted a looser set of guidelines. “I was tearing my hair out because I had worked with people for 20, 25 years, and I knew that there’s huge variation in how people react to therapy,” she said. She threw John a teasing smile. “He had to learn how to respect my knowledge. Finally.” They imagined that a happy relationship was built consecutively in seven layers. The foundation was a strong friendship, based on John’s laboratory findings that couples who spoke more fluidly and in more detail about each other and their pasts were more likely to stay together. Then came sharing admiration, “turning towards” each others’ bids and developing positive feelings about the coupling. Once that had all clicked into place, a pair could proceed through learning to manage their fights with, among other techniques, a process they dubbed “dreams within conflict,” whereby people try to see the positive dream inside what looks like a partner’s negative position. At the top–the pinnacle of a great relationship–came helping each others' dreams come true and building a shared sense of purpose, like volunteering or traveling the world. The “dreams with conflict” technique was inspired by the Gottmans’ own marital strife. One fight involved Julie’s wish, for her 50th birthday, to climb above Mount Everest’s base camp with 10 female friends. “John gets altitude sick on a ladder,” Julie said. He didn’t want her to go. In bed at night, he’d pepper her with questions: “What if you get caught in a blizzard? What if you fall in a glacier? What if you get altitude sick?” “What if you get hit by a bus?” she’d reply. Julie invited a sherpa to their house to give a presentation on the trip. The sherpa stood in the living room, 6 feet tall, dark and sexy, and showed slides of fabulous rope bridges snaking over river chasms as her friends ooh-ed and aah-ed. Afterwards, Julie asked John what he thought of the evening. “I don’t trust that sherpa. I think he just wants to have sex with you 10 women,” John recalled saying. “I was right about that, by the way.” But he came to realize what seemed like Julie’s peculiar urge to “sleep on rocks where there’s no air” stemmed from her yearning for far-flung adventure born from her difficult childhood. They also fought over whether to buy a second home. It was a priority for Julie to return to living in the forest, her childhood safe space. John initially refused. Over many “dreams within conflict” discussions, they discovered that John’s intransigence came from his own upbringing. His father, a rabbi, fled Vienna shortly before World War Two with “only some sugar and a lemon.” He counseled his son about the power of feeling free of possessions, including real estate, saying, “The only possessions you can count on are the ones inside your mind.” Finally, after a year of bickering and breakthroughs, the Gottmans felt as if they’d perfected their method, and they took on a partner to help them turn it into a business. At first, they recruited participants to their workshops by posting fliers and placing pamphlets in therapists’ waiting rooms. But within a few years, such aggressive flogging wasn’t needed anymore. Crowds flocked to the workshops and, later, to the Gottmans’ online store, which offers products like a board game that takes you and your partner, represented by little plastic pieces, on a journey across painted cardboard through the steps to building a fulfilling relationship. “There’s so much more of a burden placed on marriage now to be your social support system,” Julie reflected. “People turned out to be starving for this knowledge.”

I could relate. I met my boyfriend in 2009 at a dinner party I'd thrown to impress somebody else. He came in late, beautiful in his crisp work clothes. The chemistry was immediate. Over a series of dates, I learned he was sweet and giving, with strong ethics and a fascinating mind. We lived on separate sides of the country where we resided at the time, and we had heady months of meeting in romantic towns in the middle, eating figs and cherries we bought straight off of farms, learning about ourselves as we were reflected in each other. Much of the time, I think we made each other feel more capable, more hopeful for the future. But there were also times when we made each other feel more confused than we'd ever been in our lives. The desire to love each other was there, and yet it was with exasperation that we recognized we each sometimes didn't feel loved. What were we doing wrong? It didn’t seem clear. During a difficult period this year, lingering at my laptop deep into the night, I found myself clicking on articles that promised to turn love into a formula. “15 Ways to Stay Married for 15 Years.” “Ten Ways to Make Your Marriage Divorce-Proof.” “Must-Know Guidelines for Dating an ISTJ.” (Yes, I was desperate.) Like many people, I was particularly fascinated by a story in The New York Times called "To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This." Based on work by Arthur Aron, a psychologist at Stony Brook University, the article proposed that love could be established if a pair of random people asked each other a specific set of 36 increasingly intimate questions ("Would you like to be famous? In what way?") and then silently stared into each other’s eyes for four minutes. Two strangers paired for Aron's study actually ended up married six months later. It seemed to prove that love is a masterable technique rather than an uncontrollable force that often gives us pain. And people went wild for it. The article was viewed by more than 8 million people. Within weeks, Apple's App Store unveiled eight different apps based on it, one titled simply, “Fall in Love.” And yet as fervently as I hoped one of these recipes would make my confused love life resolve itself, deep down I wasn’t sure love could or should be built out of a manual, like something you assemble from IKEA. We live in an age that generally denies the possibility of the unpredictable. My and all my friends’ unspoken goal is to live flawlessly plotted lives based on perfect self-knowledge. We have to-do lists and bucket lists and two-year, five-year and 20-year plans created with the help of therapists. One of my friends has jiggered his iPhone to blink him reminders of his “core values” all day long, so he won’t even briefly swerve astray. For me, though, love has been the thing that has broken me out of this dreary quest for perfection. We can only consciously construct what we can already imagine, which is very little. When I was 19 and living in Belgium, I happened to fall in love with a completely inappropriate man, a 33-year-old German pastor who wore white cigarette jeans like a ’70s sitcom hustler and had spent his twenties bicycling around Europe. I never could have dreamed him up with the help of a therapist. That’s what made loving him so life-altering. He was wild, irreverent, given to reading the Song of Solomon in bed and playing hooky from his internship at a theological seminary to take the train to a town he’d never heard of–in other words, nothing like the driven, well-scheduled East Coasters I’d grown up with. And he touched those dormant qualities in myself. At the time, I wrote in a journal that being loved by him felt as if I’d been living in only three cramped rooms of the mansion that was my spirit, and then he came in with a big flashlight and led me by the hand through a warren of never-seen halls, laughing and tearing the sheets off the furniture while I trailed behind him, mouth agape. Of course, his alluring differences also bashed painfully up against my longing for a partner with whom I felt comfortable all the time. He was too old, he was too odd, he smoked too much; I agonized over the thought of introducing him to my parents. I felt at the time that forcing our relationship to “work” according to some norm would shatter it; it only worked insofar as it was broken, a queer, misshapen thing that just happened to rest beautifully atop the equally queer, misshapen circumstances that constituted our lives at 19 and 33. Likewise, surfing the web for the solution that would bring my more recent relationship to heel, I feared we couldn’t make it conform to an ideal template. A recent Quartz article insists that when choosing a life partner, we have to search for the right “eating companion for about 20,000 meals,” “travel companion for about 100 vacations,” “parenting partner” and “career therapist”–all while admitting that contemplating such a project “is like thinking about how huge the universe really is or how terrifying death really is.” The author assures you, though, that using a spreadsheet will help you feel as if it’s “fully in your control.” I guess this is supposed to be empowering; I suspect it actually puts relationships under a kind of pressure beneath which many would crumble. My boyfriend and I came from very different countries, from different kinds of families. That we managed to love each other at all was already a miracle. When we imagine thatevery human life and every complex love can be molded to fit a scientifically derived ideal, we cover our eyes to the realities of circumstance–and shame people who can’t manage to twist their circumstances to that ideal. Simon May, the philosopher who writes on love, told me that he’s known people who were accused of basic psychological failings when they couldn’t make their relationships work out. “But we have to take into account all the literature on unhappy love,” he said. “I don’t think it’s just people getting it wrong or not trying hard enough.” He called love an “earthy emotion” that often provokes restless feelings like tension and guilt, and suggested the assumption that every love affair can be managed denies the full humanity of our partners, their own “inscrutable and uncontrollable” natures. They aren’t things we can program for maximum impact like a FitBit. As I dug a little deeper into the work behind the love articles, I found that some of the people responsible for the science felt it held fewer definitive answers than we want to believe. One of them was Arthur Aron, the Stony Brook research psychologist whose work the Times glossed in “To Fall in Love with Anyone, Do This.” He was working at his second home in California when I called him. He laughed when I mentioned the Times story. He’d designed the 36 questions, he said, to artificially “create closeness” in a laboratory setting between same-sex heterosexual strangers, not lovers. One of his grad students had also tried the method on some heterosexual opposite-sex pairs, and one pair had, funny enough, fallen in love, but the lab hadn’t followed up with the others. Aron has studied love in many other experiments, and he’s been struck by how contextual factors influence relationships. “Unfortunately the single biggest [factor], if you look across the world, is stress,” he said. “If you’re very poor, if you’re in a crime-ridden neighborhood, it’s hard for any relationship to work out very well. That’s not one we can do much about as individuals.” Aron also pointed out that a lot of the science on happy love was based on averages, creating a norm away from which couples can stray very, very far and still be happy. Take a recent study claiming the ideal age to marry is between 25 and 34. The study reflects the center hump of a scattered group of dots representing pairs older and younger that all work in their own way. And the reporting on it outrageously inverts causation. The study’s authors mused that people who married younger might have been less settled, and those who waited until later might have been be more “congenitally cantankerous,” upping their divorce rates. That doesn’t mean arbitrarily marrying in your late twenties would do anything whatsoever to improve your chances. And yet, I still read a story on Vox headlined, “Want to Avoid Divorce? Here’s the Best Age to Get Married.” John Gottman designed his experiments to allow numerous variables to emerge, creating a much richer formula. But his findings were limited by the pool from which he drew his test subjects, communities in Illinois, Washington, Indiana and the San Francisco Bay Area with their own local habits. “There’s this sort of big mystery at the heart of things,” another psychologist told me. That psychologist was Robert Levenson–the same man with whom John had pioneered his work. I reached him on the phone at Berkeley, where he now teaches. He and John are still close, and Levenson praised John’s “fierce interest” in what makes marriages last. “It’s not surprising that at the end of the day, after our research, he spent a significant part of his life working on interventions,” Levenson reflected. But he wasn’t so sure the actions he and John had observed happy couples performing could be turned into a do-it-at-home blueprint. “We actually don’t know what got the happy couples to that point,” he said. What makes two human beings want to turn towards each others’ bids 87 percent of the time, give a shit about the fragile dreams hiding behind each others’ most intransigent and frustrating opinions and have that magical effect on each other like a powerful chemical tranquilizer in the first place? This, he said, still “requires scientific study.” Kendra Han, the workshop employee, admitted she doesn’t follow up after couples leave the conference to see whether the method made them happier. Two studies conducted by the Gottmans show that the method really can move people along a happiness spectrum: A 2000 intervention given to already-healthy couples expecting a child revealed that it helped them weather the difficulties of becoming parents, and a 2013 Journal of Family Therapy study of 80 couples showed that most maintained gains in marital satisfaction a year after “The Art and Science of Love” workshop. This is less definitive than the promise to transform disasters into masters, though, and the method wasn’t directly compared to other therapies. Robert Levenson told me couples-therapy purveyors can be reluctant to do comparative studies, and gave a hypothetical example of why based on the finding that happy couples use "we" a lot. “What if I have the Levenson ‘We’ Therapy, where people come to my ‘We’ training and learn how to use ‘We'?" he asked me. "Then I do a study and compare it with the Gottman approach and it turns out the Gottman approach does much better. But what about my ‘We’ building and my ‘We’ weekends and my ‘We Retreat’ at Club Med?”

Back at the Gottman Method workshop, the 500 of us periodically broke out into pairs for exercises: 20 minutes to practice showing each other admiration, 30 to try to work through a serious problem that triggered our "enduring vulnerabilities.” There were tip sheets to draw out of our kits: a master list of 100 adjectives to choose from when praising our partners—brave, reliable, hot—and a collection of lines to use when we’re overwhelmed during arguments. I’m sorry, but I’m feeling flooded. Can we take 20? I’d come in skeptical. But not two hours into the exercises, I found myself overwhelmed by emotion. All of the concepts were just abstract enough to find a specific analogue in my relationship. As I recognized my boyfriend’s particular lovely qualities in the list of adjectives, I got a flush of warm and peaceful feelings, the kind John’s laboratory research determined were necessary to support the calm physiology that underpins lasting love. A “love map” exercise got me to contemplate the gaps in our friendship and ways to fill them. The dreams-within-conflict exercise helped me understand the hopes for being a good dad that my boyfriend had vested in the ways he wanted to raise our future children. In their lectures, the Gottmans performed the same quirky, vulnerable marital dynamic that I observed in my interview. In one memorable hour, they role-played a past “regrettable incident,” first handling it in a bad way, then in a good way. As we all watched, John harshly criticized Julie for being too worried about their daughter’s health. Julie slumped over the podium and actually cried. Then he started over with empathy, gently teasing out the issue from her personal history–the polio she contracted as a child due to her parents’ neglect. As we saw the change on Julie's face, we all drew a breath. Suddenly, altering the trajectory of those terrible fights, the ones that can feel as though they're breaking our partnerships apart, seemed possible. We saw it happen. It’s not hard to find people who vow that the Gottman Method completely transformed their relationships. Last month, I called one of the thousands of couples-therapy practices that use the Gottman Method, BestMarriages in southern British Columbia, and asked for referrals to couples who were willing to talk. Several pairs emailed me, eagerly requesting to be interviewed. There’s another way to tell the story of how John and Julie fell in love, one that brings to the fore the awesome workings of destiny. Bonnie, 49, told me that she and her husband Brian, “definitely a disaster couple,” were going to end their union, but a year of biweekly counseling in the Gottman Method “completely turned things around.” Donald, 50, said he’d also given up on his 24-year marriage to Donna. There had been affairs; the two had drifted apart. But encountering the Gottmans’ lingo—the “enduring vulnerabilities,” the “rituals of connection,” the “turning towards”—suddenly put meaning to the language-less, mysterious eddy of emotions that had been the relationship. It gave them things to do. Donald started sending Donna text messages every afternoon: “How was your day?” When he had a difficult encounter with a testy colleague, Donna shared her admiration for him, telling him how proud she was of him for handling it well. When Donna had a cold and snored, the “old Don,” she said, would have roused her by “huffing and puffing with annoyance.” Instead, he employed the Gottmans’ patented “softened start-up,” waking her gently, expressing concern for her sore throat, and later sending her a note from work thanking her for rolling over to the other side of the bed. Talking to them by video Skype, I never would have known the two had struggled. They cuddled up to one another in the frame and giggled like smitten high-schoolers as they retold the story of how they met. “We spotted each other,” Donna grinned, sticking her tongue out at Don. “She was on a balcony,” Donald said, smiling back. “It was like Romeo and Juliet.” I also got to watch Julie counsel a couple, Shantel and Paul, using the Gottman Method. The pair comes from a poorer neighborhood in Seattle, and they got free therapy in 2007 in exchange for agreeing to be filmed to help train other Gottman Method counselors. I’d intended to dip in just for a few minutes to get a sense of how Julie worked. But I ended up viewing six hours of the counseling in one afternoon, transfixed. Though Paul and Shantel could hardly have seemed less like me and my partner in their particulars–they had children; a low ebb in their relationship occurred after Paul got shot–so much of the by-turns-playful-and-reproachful dance that they did with each other on Julie’s couch reminded me of my own relationships: the flirty exchanges, the deep concern for each other, the subtle digs at each others’ flaws, the sudden flares of anger as they touched each other on open wounds. Shantel wept as she recounted how Paul criticized her; Paul cried himself as he recalled being abandoned by his godmother and how he fears Shantel’s rejection. I called Shantel in late July. Like the other couples I spoke to, she reckoned the Gottman Method “kept us married.” Since they’d met as young teens, she and Paul had basically been each other’s only ports in an incredibly stormy world. In his teens, Paul got involved in the drug trade; later, the pair got caught up in the predatory lending crisis and briefly became homeless. Add to that the fact that they had not selected each other to ride out this turmoil on the basis of a problem-solving-compatibility survey but on love, which often, like a trickster determined to upend our tidy plans, draws opposites together and, by reminding us of our emotionally fraught childhood bonds with our parents, brutally reveals just how vulnerable and childlike we really still are. Add to that the fact that our culture teaches us to expect love to “feel right,” to feel like a peaceful resolution rather than an adventure, to feel as calm as faith. “Every time we got into a huge argument, we thought it must not be ‘meant to be,’” Shantel said. Julie’s techniques gave them a way to navigate the astounding complexity that is a marriage based on love. “One of the biggest things is being able to notice when we are ‘flooded’ and when we are at a place we can’t even engage and giving each other that space,” she told me. “We love telling each other when we’re ‘turning towards’ each other. ‘Hey, I’m making an attempt here to turn towards you. What I did was wrong. It was unfair.’ And the other person is receptive to that because we both have an understanding of what it means.” In private, the Gottmans are much more nuanced on the impossibility of healing some relationships than they are in public. “Sometimes, really, people’s dreams don’t mesh,” John reflected. “There are all kinds of reasons why therapy can fail.” I got the sense they deeply care about couples in pain—they asked me several times about my own relationship. Their promise that mastering love is possible is, in part, an effort to comfort couples enmeshed in terrifying complexity. “Even if you can give somebody one little nugget of something they can take in, it’s helpful,” Julie said. I still don’t quite know what’s going to happen with my relationship. But I left the workshop wanting to try the Gottmans’ techniques. They brought to mind a line from Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian: “The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. ... Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way.” The new love science may be just a string in the increasingly huge and windy maze that is contemporary love, no more absolute than all the other ways of thinking about love we’ve invented over 50,000 years—but we need that string.

Before I left Seattle, the Gottmans invited me out to their home on Orcas, the forested island off the northwest Washington coast. A giant silver sculpture of a heart invites visitors down a steep, wooded path towards the sea. The house’s interior is a wondrous world unto itself: wood carvings, ochre-and-sienna Native American-inspired throw blankets, shelves and shelves of books, a wooden dining-room table painted with playful injunctions. Enjoy the fruits of your labors. Open your mind. Seek knowledge. Seize the day. Cherish the night. “It’s mostly Julie,” John said proudly as we tucked our feet into sheepskin slippers. “She’s a frustrated architect.” He stopped in front of a huge oil portrait just off the foyer depicting the two Gottmans together, smiling and leaning into each other. A friend had painted it. “I love this because it really captures our relationship,” he said. He paused for a moment before the painting as if to take it in anew. Settling into their brown couches, I asked John and Julie if they felt the pain depicted in the millennia of literature on love, the ups and downs and the sense of bewilderment we now try to manage, was somehow necessary, or if better science could increase our skill at love such that we wouldn’t have to go through such torment anymore. Both fell silent for 20 seconds. “I think the pain has to do with balance, and how difficult it is to balance between attending to your partner’s needs and staying true to who you are,” Julie said. “I have a different answer,” John said. “I don’t think it’s necessary. When you haven’t been able to build trust, there’s the constant sense that this person isn’t there for you. They’re there for themselves but not for you. But we now know that there are really systematic processes through which people build trust and commitment.” Recently, he’d been working on the mathematics of building trust in relationships based on John Nash’s concept of the cooperative equilibrium, where two players in a game seek the best possible outcome for both of them. But he also acknowledged that his painful younger relationships were steps on the path to Julie, showing him what he really wanted and how he needed to change. Julie said the same of her first marriage. If everybody involved had known then what you know now about how to build a good relationship, I asked, could you have made your earlier marriages work? “No,” Julie said. “I don’t think so,” John said. There’s another way to tell the story of how John and Julie fell in love, one that brings to the fore not the scientifically based steps by which they built their coupledom but rather the awesome workings of destiny. I got the sense this story was more important to them than the other one. Revealing it, they curled closer together on the couch, Julie nestling her head into the crook of John’s neck, John massaging her leg. Two years before she met John, Julie said, she’d had a vision of the man she would spend her life with. Her vision had shown the man from behind. When John got up from the table to pay the bill on their first date at the Pony Expresso, and turned around, she felt a shock so sudden it left her trembling: It was him, the man from her vision. Later, she came to believe fate had brought them together for the higher purpose of helping couples: “I see our predestiny, the sacred holiness, as to do this little tiny bit of healing as tikkun olam”–Jews’ duty to repair the world. Julie’s scientist brain knows that feelings of intense attraction come down to hormones and pheromones, but, she said, “I don’t know how to put that together with the fact that I had this vision of him.” Perhaps, someday, a scientifically observable process will allow us to understand exactly what it is, that sense of mysterious destiny we can find in other people, not created but seemingly sent from on high. But is that a world in which we’d actually want to live? John smiled as he recounted the puzzling sensation he experienced that evening in the Pony Expresso, similar to Julie’s. He’d been unhappy for decades. In the months before that encounter, he said he’d gone on 60 dates, trying to establish a “database” of women to choose from. And then he met Julie and felt unaccountably whole. “I’ve never felt alone since,” he said. “Oh, sweetie,” Julie murmured. “You’re going to make me cry.”

It’s not something that’s come up recently,” said Moran.

But even before its designation as a national holiday, the date was controversial. The first ‘day of mourning’ march was held in Sydney in 1938 to mark 150 years since the British arrival, with posters at the time saying the protest was against “the whitemen’s seizure of our country” and “the callous treatment of our people.” And in past years, as other Australians hold barbecues, go to the beach, or host a party, thousands of indigenous and non-indigenous people have upheld the tradition to participate in ‘Day Of Mourning’ protest marches in major cities nationwide.

Critics say this short history as a national holiday means it can and should be changed to a more inclusive date that all Australians, including the nation’s first people, can celebrate.

Australia Day has only been held as a nationally-recognized and consistent public holiday on Jan. 26 since 1994, but individual states have held their own formal or informal celebrations since soon after the 1788 landing.

“Australia Day will always be known as a day of mourning for our community,” said Nathan Moran, CEO of Sydney’s Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council, and a man of Thungutti and Biripai Goori heritage.

Calls to change the date of Australia Day have existed for years, with organized protests existing since at least 1938. But a recent groundswell of support from the entertainment industry and a growing base of political support have amplified the calls for changing the date.

The country celebrates its national holiday ― Australia Day ― on Jan. 26, the anniversary of the day in 1788 when British settlers arrived in Sydney to establish a prison colony. The date is commonly recognized as the birth of modern Australia, but it also marks the beginning of more than a century of trauma for the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, who were dispossessed of their lands, murdered by settlers and decimated by European diseases. Even today, people of indigenous heritage are subject to social, health and employment outcomes far below those of the wider Australian population.

Australia is gearing up to celebrate its national holiday this week amid growing calls for the date of the celebration to be changed out of respect for the country’s Aboriginal people.

Calls For Change

Public support for a change of the date has increased in the last several years. A recent poll released by The Australia Institute found that 56 percent of citizens didn’t care which day the holiday is marked, and 49 percent said the holiday should not be on a day that is offensive to indigenous Australians, but only 37 percent thought Jan. 26 was an offensive day for indigenous people.

After deciding not to host Australia Day celebrations last year, several local councils announced plans to move citizenship ceremonies traditionally held on Jan. 26 day to a new date. But the federal government swiftly stepped in and stripped two of those councils of the right to host citizenship ceremonies.

But other segments of Australian society have embraced change.

Richard Di Natale, leader of the Australia Greens party ― the third-largest voting bloc in the Australian parliament ― announced last week that his party would launch a national campaign in support of changing the date of Australia Day.

“We need to acknowledge that there are people who see Jan. 26 as a day that represents pain and suffering, the ongoing effect of which can still be felt today,” he said at a press conference last week.

Members of the entertainment industry have also taken up the fight.

Triple J, Australia’s popular national youth radio station, has for many years run an annual ‘Hottest 100’ countdown on Australia Day of the top 100 songs of the previous year. However, following an online poll of its listeners, the station announced it would hold the countdown on another day this year, saying “it should be an event that everyone can enjoy together.”

The reform was in no small part due to campaigning by A.B. Original, the popular indigenous rap act. The duo are known for their politically-charged songs, which often focus on issues like racism and police brutality. Lyrics from their song “January 26,” which was voted the 16th most popular song in Triple J’s 2016 countdown, compare commemorating the date to celebrating “on your nan’s grave” and having people “piss on her face.”

“I don’t think you can find a more concise analogy. We don’t want to piss on your nan’s grave but that’s what it means to us. It’s a slap in the face,” A.B. Original member Briggs told HuffPost in 2016.

But supporters of Australia Day in its current format ― which include Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, federal opposition leader Bill Shorten and many powerful media figures ― argue that Jan. 26 has been celebrated, formally or informally, in some way since the British settlers first arrived in 1788. They have accused those arguing for change of being motivated by political correctness or a desire to cause political division.

“I’m disappointed by those who want to change the date of Australia Day, seeking to take a day that unites Australia and Australians and turn it into one that would divide us,” Turnbull said in a Facebook video on the topic. “A free country debates its history, it does not deny it. It builds new monuments as it preserves old ones, writes new books not burn old ones.”

But Amanda Kearney, an associate professor in anthropology at the University of New South Wales, told HuffPost that it is wrong to ask Aboriginal people to simply forget the traumas of the past, as some politicians and others have suggested. Kearney, whose work focuses on Australia’s Aboriginal people, specifically studies a concept she calls “cultural wounding,” which looks at how past trauma or violence experienced by people of a certain culture can leave lasting effects that carry on far into the future for members of that culture.

“[British colonization] was an exercise in attempting to erase a rich culture. It’s a huge event in time and space, and it’s a very naïve attitude that this can go away with the passage of time, that the effects dissolve and people move on,” she said.

“The idea of celebrating Australia Day is a clear statement about what’s important to remember. It’s a celebration of an attempt to erase a whole range of diverse cultures, and ways of being.”

Therefore, Kearney argues, changing the date would be a powerful symbol that Australia wants to atone for past injustices against indigenous people.

Moran, from the Metro Local Aboriginal Land Council, agreed. He told HuffPost his heritage traces back to people from the very clans who lived on the land where British settlers first set foot in Sydney. As a result, he has strong opposition to celebrating Australia Day on Jan. 26.

“The emergence of Jan. 26 as some national patriotic day ― it’s quite sickening and appalling for our community. It’s celebrating the invasion of someone’s country. That’s not about celebrating for us,” he said. “It’s never been a day of celebration. It’s forever the day foreign invaders arrived.”

“It’ll always be a day of significance, and we’ll never forget it, don’t you worry. But I don’t think it’s a day of patriotism or celebration,” he added.

Not everyone in the indigenous community shares Moran’s commitment to changing the date. A counter-campaign to preserve the holiday on Jan. 26 counts Aboriginal woman and Alice Springs local councillor Jacinta Price as one of its major spokespersons.

“For Aboriginal people, in order to actually really grow and move forward we need to do a bit of soul-searching within ourselves and not have this expectation that everyone else around us has to change in order to make us feel better about who we are within ourselves,” Price said in an interview on ABC radio last week.

“I don’t see how the date (of Jan. 26) itself denies parts of our history. I think it’s actually significant for our history to recognize that.”

Kearney, the anthropologist, said there appears to be a generational gap among indigenous people when it comes to the date change. Older people, she noted, generally feel it is not a priority issue for Aboriginal people, while many younger people support a change.

Linda Burney, a federal member of parliament and the first indigenous woman to be elected to the House of Representatives, told HuffPost that while she acknowledged Jan. 26 was a “difficult and painful day for many First Australians,” her community had bigger issues to deal with.

“[Jan. 26] marks the usurpation of Aboriginal sovereignty. I’m not sure this ought to be the most defining moment in our nation’s history. I don’t see the date of Australia Day changing any time soon, and I don’t propose changing it,” she said in a statement.

“But I do think that we should use this day as an opportunity to reflect on the pain of the past as well as on how we can improve the lives of First Australians.”

“I think above all else, Aboriginal people are most concerned about the more concrete issues that affect their lives – like, jobs, housing, health care and education.”0

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/kirstin-chaplin/what-ive-learned-from-a-year-without-alcohol_a_23322136/What I've Learned From A Year Without AlcoholOn New Year’s Eve 2016, after years of berating myself, I finally took the plunge and decided to stop drinking for a year.

My drinking wasn’t excessive, but it was enough to fill me with self-loathing and make me tearful and jittery the next day - even after just a couple of glasses. It was time to break ties.

Now, as any of you who have tried to give something up - whether it be short or long term - will know it’s pretty daunting. And, when it’s something like alcohol, something that the very fibre of our society hangs on, it’s tougher still.

I started by writing a list of 50 reasons to stop. I figured if I could find that many reasons then there was really no excuse to carry on. You can read that hastily scribbled list here. I choose a year because I wanted to give myself a fighting chance and ’forever felt too long, too final.

Here’s what I’ve learned...

1. I didn’t feel amazing instantly

The first question everyone asks when you stop drinking is ‘Do you feel amazing?’ For me, it was sadly a no. I had expected to leap out for bed looking fresh-faced and consumed with boundless energy, however that wasn’t the case. I envied friends who, after stopping for just a few days in January were already reporting feeling ‘100x better’. The energy took it’s time to arrive but now, a year on, I definitely feel I have more mental energy and am starting to think about what else is possible in my life.

2. Giving up for a year is easier than giving up for a month

I found that when I stopped for a month in the past, the social pressure to drink piled on. ‘You have to drink at XYZ,’ or ‘can’t you just add another week on at the end?’ As soon as I told people I was giving up for a year the pressure turned to congratulations. I lost count of the number of people who told me ‘I wish I could do it too.’

3. The booze-free market is booming

I’ve yet to find a credible replacement for wine - everything is too thin, too sweet - BUT there are plenty of great 0% beers out there that can act as a placebo in the early days and I can’t speak highly enough of Tesco’s Virgin G&T’s. Having forgotten what gin tastes like and having failed to get on the Seedlip bandwagon, I asked friends to road test the low alcohol G&T and it got thumbs up all round. At 0.5% alcohol it is technically a non-alcoholic drink but, if you wanted to split hairs, my argument would be that yes, there’s a hint of booze in it - enough to kill the FOMO but not enough to give you a hangover in the morning.

4. It’s a mindset

During the past year I’ve attended a two weddings (my brother’s and my best friend’s) a hen weekend in Palma and a week-long holiday in France with three other families. In the past just one of these events would have been a reason not to give up in 2017. But, I knew that if I kept finding social excuses it would never happen. At the start of the year it seemed impossible that I could attend or enjoy those events without alcohol. The truth is I enjoyed them all the more hangover-free. I reasoned that it was no-one else’s business what was in my glass, why should they care? And that thought, somehow, got me through.

5. You find out who you really are

After 20+ years of social drinking I wanted to know who I really was without it. That sounds a bit deep, right? I won’t lie, I was pretty disappointed to find that I felt sad and miserable most of the time - was that the lack of booze or had the booze been masking / exacerbating a deeper problem? In the summer I eventually visited the doctor to talk about depression. It turned out I had low iron storage which left me feeling permanently exhausted. Now, as long as I keep on top of that, I feel fine.

6. You are not alone

Aside from the public admiration of others I have been amazed by how many people have contacted me privately to say they have also given up drinking or are very close to it. One of the best things about this year has been inadvertently inspiring others. I promise you I am not anti-alcohol - I’ve always said that if alcohol doesn’t affect your life in a negative way then there’s no need to stop. But it’s messages like the one I received this morning (and that finally inspired me to write this blog) that make it all the sweeter; ‘With your inspiration I have decided to do a year booze-free. I am both excited and terrified at the prospect. I need to stop using it as my crutch and the fact I feel the amount I drink is creeping up gradually. I would never had contemplated this last New Year. I envied you when you posted as I didn’t think I could honestly go a week never mind a year. I am so scared but so excited for 2018. I have hid behind it for too long.’

7. You can do it, you really can

Nothing is impossible, certainly not what you choose to pour into a glass and then choose to pour into your mouth. There are a lot of people out there monetising this hot new trend (apparently the Millennials are turning their backs on booze in a big way) but you don’t need to pay to do it. Take one day at a time. One weekend at a time. One social event at a time. Don’t think of the bigger picture. Just get through each day and when you wake up feeling hangover-free, feel bloody proud of yourself and hang onto that feeling. You could also check out this free Club Soda Alcohol Free Facebook group.

8. I’m more confident now that I was before

Now this one surprised me. People drink to give them confidence but I see now that I used to hide behind alcohol and wouldn’t mix outside of my small circle. Now, when I’m out, I’ve found that I’m actually interested in having conversations with people - I honestly feel more confident now than I ever did before. Perhaps it’s not worrying about making a fool of myself. Maybe it’s knowing I won’t wake up with ‘the fear.’ Whatever it is, I love it.

9. Everyone wants to know...

‘Are you going to carry on?’ In January last year the thought of never drinking again was too big to contemplate, in some ways it still is. Over the past year I’ve battled backwards and forwards, sometimes feeling ‘ready’ to drink again in 2018, other times scared I’ll just fall back into the old bad habits. All I can say it that right now, waking up hangover and anxiety-free is enough of an incentive to carry on. As a new year approaches I’m thinking of new challenges - I want to get fit again, blog more... and that, is enough for me.0

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/01/23/james-franco-accusers-ask-please-just-apologize_a_23341786/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepageJames Franco Accusers Ask: 'Please Just Apologize'James Franco acknowledged sexual misconduct accusations against him earlier this month, and said “if” he has “done something wrong,” he will do whatever he can to make it right.

Two of his accusers are now offering suggestions: Apologize, and start offering better opportunities for women.

“Please just apologize,” comedy writer Violet Paley said on “Good Morning America” Tuesday.

Paley decided to share her past experience with the actor after spotting him at the Golden Globes earlier this month wearing a #TimesUp pin in support of the anti-sexual-harassment initiative. Over Twitter, she said Franco had pursued at least two underaged girls, and once tried to force her to perform oral sex on a date.

“I just didn’t want him to hate me, so I did it,” she told the Los Angeles Times.

Filmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan, an accuser who appeared with Paley on “Good Morning America,” suggested Franco use “his power to give opportunities to women that are real and valuable.”

Franco has many roles in the entertainment industry, including director and acting teacher, that have allowed him to support up-and-coming talent. Tither-Kaplan was one of his students.

She said Franco exploited female performers in a class on sex scenes by adding sex and nudity to scripts without fully explaining the artistic value. Women who felt uncomfortable were “asked to leave or just not asked to be in the projects.”

Still, Tither-Kaplan said she sees a path to redemption for the actor, who briefly stepped out of the limelight after a handful of women spoke out against him.

“He’s not an unforgivable person, at least for me,” Tither-Kaplan said, adding that Franco “is absolutely not a Harvey Weinstein.”

“It’s a pyramid. At the top is rape and sexual violence and at the bottom are other abuses of power that, when they continue to happen, build and build and build until they create a culture that allows the most heinous examples of sexual violence and misogyny and discrimination to happen,” Tither-Kaplan said.

The women’s comments come as the discussion on sexual abuse, sparked by a series of bombshell reports on former producer Weinstein, has widened to encompass a nuanced variety of unwanted behavior by high-profile men.

Franco, after earning a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award for his performance in “The Disaster Artist,” was noticeably absent from the list of Oscar nominees released early Tuesday, leading to speculation that the accusations contributed to the snub.0

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2018/01/22/10-signs-youre-headed-for-a-sexless-marriage_a_23340505/?utm_hp_ref=au-homepage10 Signs You're Headed For A Sexless MarriageThough rarely discussed, sexless marriages are far more common than you might think.

It’s been estimated that as many as 15 percent of married couples have not had sex within the last six to 12 months, according to a 2009 New York Times article.

Of course, partners’ levels of desire may fluctuate over time for a number of reasons ― for example, the birth of a child, health problems or medication side effects. And there are relationships in which both partners are perfectly content with infrequent sex or not having sex at all. But for many couples, it is an integral part of sustaining a physical and emotional connection.

We asked sex therapists to share some signs that a couple might be heading toward a sexless marriage. Below, 10 potential warning signs to look out for:

1. You’re starting to feel more like roommates than intimate partners.

“We underestimate the importance of physical attraction in long-term relationships. In the beginning, couples make commitments to grooming, wearing clothes that make them feel desirable and feeling good about themselves. When you start to feel like roommates, you might need to change out of your sweats and comfy clothes and get ready for an intimate night together. Take a long bath or shower, put on something that makes you feel good about yourself, and put energy into feeling sensual. Even if you are staying in for the night, put something on that makes you feel open for sex and connection, like your favorite lingerie or use a new massage oil or perfume.” ― Shannon Chavez, psychologist and sex therapist

2. You’re not comfortable talking about sex together.

“If you’ve never had an open conversation about sex, it’s likely that you’ll have a sexless period in your relationship. Communication is essential to a healthy sex life, and intimacy just can’t flourish without it.” ― Vanessa Marin, sex therapist and creator of Finishing School, the online orgasm course for women

3. You’re giving all of your time and energy to the kids.

“While most new parents need to focus much of their time, energy and resources on the newborn, it’s important to recognize that you need to nurture yourself and your relationship once the baby is a couple of months old. There are many parents who struggle to go out on a date after having children due to financial constraints. It’s important for partners to engage with one another as adults with a variety of interests other than their kids in order to keep the erotic energy going. You can have sex while your kids are sleeping, but if all you’ve been doing night after night is reading stories and cleaning up after dinner, the routine can become old and exhausting. It leaves little time to connect romantically and sensually with your partner.”― Sari Cooper, sex therapist and director of the Center for Love and Sex NYC

4. You avoid watching romantic or erotic scenes on TV or in movies together.

“Sex scenes in movies or on TV may inspire couples to get it on. They may see something they want to try, or they may get aroused just watching. If watching erotic scenes makes you uncomfortable, this may be indicative of a problem in your own sex life or trigger some aspect of your own sexuality that is shameful or confusing. Being able to enjoy a sexy scene with you partner is a sign of sexual health. If shame or embarrassment is getting in the way, it may be a sign of a problem. If you struggle to maintain sexual attraction to your partner, watching a sexy movie may serve as a painful reminder that you ‘lost that lovin’ feeling.’ It may also spark a conversation that you do not want to have. Honesty is the best policy. Communicating directly about your sexual satisfaction, expectations and preferences is the best way to avoid a sexless relationship.” ― Kimberly Resnick Anderson, sex therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine

5. You stop flirting with each other.

“When your partner is starting to feel like a ‘best friend’ that you want to gossip on the couch with after a long day at work instead of connecting in a sensual and intimate way, it’s time to create some space for being lovers and bring erotic energy into your connection together. Flirt, make eye contact, use body language to feel sexy and sensual. Move your body and be intentional about turning your partner on. Instead of turning to your partner and saying, ‘Do you want to have sex?’ at the end of the night, work on creating anticipation, hints outside of the bedroom, texting and communication that show you are interested in being connected and intimate together.” ― Chavez

6. Your partner makes fun of your sex drive, or lack thereof.

“If your partner regularly mocks or derides your sex drive, that’s not a good sign. All couples have sex drives that are mismatched to some degree, but it’s important to be respectful of each other’s needs even if they don’t match our own.” ― Marin

7. You rarely touch each other inside or outside of the bedroom.

“Perhaps you haven’t touched in months, even to kiss hello or goodbye. And you don’t touch while you watch TV on the couch or hold hands in the car. ” ―Tammy Nelson, sex therapist and author of Getting the Sex You Want

8. You purposely stay up later than your partner to avoid the ‘Not tonight, honey’ conversation.

“Being in the same bed at the same time as your partner increases the likelihood of having sexual contact. If you find yourself avoiding going to bed until after your partner is asleep, you may be consciously (or subconsciously) decreasing the odds of having sex. You need to ask yourself some tough questions: Why don’t I want to be awake in the same bed at the same time as my partner? Are there aspects of my sex life that are disappointing or anxiety-provoking? Avoiding may feel easier than hurting your partner’s feelings, but an honest conversation (first with yourself and then with your partner) may keep you from ending up in a sexless marriage.” ― Resnick Anderson

9. You jam-pack your schedule with other obligations, leaving little time for each other.

“While this could be true of many couples in this day and age — when work can call upon you wherever you happen to be via email or text — the couples that leave some time for fun, pleasure and intimacy are the ones who have a better chance of committing to creating time for sex. There are also hints that one or both partners are unconsciously avoiding intimacy through the overloading of their schedule.” ― Cooper

10. You have unrealistic expectations about what sex should be like.

“Focus less on the outcome or what you are doing during sex and focus more on how you are feeling and the pleasure you are experiencing. Sex that is focused on a goal will create expectations that are unrealistic and increase the potential for disappointment if those expectations are not met. The best focus for sex is to create an environment with a partner where you can give and receive pleasure. It should focus less on the mechanics of sex and more on the sensations, pleasures and connection you are feeling with a partner. Also, no two sexual experiences are ever the same so let go of the evaluation and grading.” ― Chavez-1

Yet the map’s shape seemed to inspire comments that were more on the hot and bothered side.

One woman said, “I’m sick and tired of being promised 6-7 inches and only getting 4!!!” to which another commenter replied, “Well it’s probably because your messing with the wrong weather guy.”

Another guy hoped the storm would prematurely finish and leave people “very unimpressed with the overall experience.”

Other hilarious reactions include:

“If this storm lasts longer than 4 hours, seek immediate medical attention.”

“Tennessee says, ‘Not right now Texas I’m tired.’”

“Don’t expect this storm to pull out quickly...”

“I guess you could say Mother Nature really has a hard on for the gulf coast lately.”

“Storms definitely going to penetrate deep down south.”

“There should always be a warning when it’s more than 6 inches.”

The most philosophical response to the penis-shaped weather map may be one from a woman who wondered how future generations might view it.

“In a few thousand years, some alien historian is going to stumble across this post and read the comments and finally understand, after years of study, exactly how we humans, a clever and able species, managed to let ourselves get caught in another ice age, for we were too busy making dick jokes to flee, and I’m ok with that.”

At the risk of sounding like a dick, it should be noted that penis-shaped weather maps are actually quite common.1

Yet the genre still maintains its youthful appeal as anyone who has been snarled at by a teen wearing a Ramones T-shirt can attest.

That’s why old school punks can relate to a new song by a bunch of cranky old musicians called, appropriately enough, “Fuck Youth.”

The Los Angeles-based punk group Superbean performs the song that doesn’t mince words:

“Kids today think they’re so great

They think they really got it made

GOT IT MADE!

When I was their age it was so much cooler

When I got older I found out the truth

FUCK YOUTH!”



And, yes, the video for the song features an old guy yelling, “You kids get off my lawn!”

Steve Moramarco, the group’s 51-year-old guitarist, insists he’s “not anti-youth,” but “Fuck Youth” is the type of song every generation sings.

“In the old days punk rock was about the kids, the ‘wild youth’ in the streets,” he told HuffPost. “Today all the punks are old and it’s the kids that are the problem.”

The song seems to be striking a chord with people who’ve been moshing since back in the day.

The video was posted on Facebook earlier this week and already has more than 110,000 views, and Moramarco said he’s receiving positive remarks from as far away as Brazil and Switzerland.0

HBO announced Thursday that new episodes will not be ready until 2019 ― a prospect network brass hinted at when Season 7 concluded last summer. Sophie Turner, who plays the increasingly hardheaded Sansa Stark, let slip that she fully expected the series to return in 2019, but this is the first HBO has affirmed the timeline.

Season 8 will be the shortest yet, consisting of just six episodes, although some could be extra long. Season 7 saw the series’ shortest-ever and longest-ever episodes, at 50 minutes and 80 minutes, respectively.

Although fans waited a couple extra months for the most recent installment ― because the wintry setting required film crews to push production later in the year ― the show usually debuts in the spring. The network has not specified precisely when in 2019 to expect a finale, but there’s a good chance HBO will revert back to a springtime release date for Season 8.

By all accounts, the extended waiting period will be worth it, giving showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss more time to craft what might be the most anticipated series finale in television history. With its fiery battle scenes and a deadly ice dragon, Season 7 has already raised production expectations sky-high.

And our lingering questions are many: How will Jon and Dany find out they’re related? What will they do with that disturbing knowledge? Will Cersei seriously have another kid? When is Melisandre coming back? Has everyone died at the Wall??-1

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not one to shy away from trying any new skincare trend, whether that be jade rollers, derma-rolling, squalane, or even snail serum. But because I have more oily skin, I naturally thought that a water-based cleanser was my best option because it would help remove all shininess.

What I failed to realize was that my cleanser was actually drying out my skin, causing it to go into oil-production overload and exacerbating the issue to begin with. Oil cleansing is a gentler but just as effective way to dissolve those bad oils on our face, while also softening, nourishing, and brightening our skin because it’s less harsh than your average cleanser.

So far this week, three shootings have happened at or near schools. At least eight more took place in the first three weeks of 2018.

A student bringing a gun onto school property and firing at peers or teachers seems to occur most often, though that’s not always what happens. Two of the shootings this month were later identified as suicides. And in one instance, a 32-year-old man shot at a school bus with a pellet gun.

Here’s the complete list of shooting incidents schools have faced so far this year:

Jan. 23: Marshall County High School in Benton, Kentucky

A 15-year-old boy opened fire inside the school, killing two and injuring 16.

Jan. 22: NET Charter High School in New Orleans, Louisiana

Someone driving by the school fired on a group of students in the parking lot. Only one boy was injured.

Jan. 22: Italy High School in Italy, Texas

A 16-year-old boy shot a 15-year-old girl in the cafeteria. He was arrested and she was airlifted to a hospital, where she was “in good spirits” as of Tuesday.

Jan. 20: Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina

Following an argument, a 21-year-old Winston-Salem University student was shot and killed during a sorority event at Wake Forest University.

Jan. 15: Wiley College in Marshall, Texas

Two people in a car exchanged gunfire with a person in a dormitory parking lot. No one was injured, but a bullet was fired into a dorm room with three female students inside.

Jan. 10: Coronado Elementary School in Sierra Vista, Arizona

A 14-year-old died in a school bathroom from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Jan. 10: Grayson College in Denison, Texas

A student confused a training weapon with a real one and fired a bullet through a classroom wall. No students were injured.

Jan. 10: California State University in San Bernardino, California

At least one shot was fired, shattering one classroom window. No students were injured.

Jan. 6: School bus in Forest City, Iowa

A 32-year-old man fired a pellet gun at a school bus, shattering one of the windows. No students were injured.

Jan. 4: New Start High School in Seattle, Washington

Two shots were fired at the school from outside the building. No students were injured.

Jan. 3: East Olive Elementary School in St. John, Michigan

A man standing in the school’s parking lot called 911 saying he was suicidal. He spoke with a county official for several hours on the phone, according to local media, but ultimately shot himself and died from a single gunshot wound.-2

The report, which doesn’t specify when Pompeo was questioned, also says Mueller’s office spoke to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers last year.

A source told NBC the three men were questioned about former FBI Director James Comey’s firing. Trump dismissed Comey in May and later publicly admitted that the Russia investigation was a factor in that decision.

Mueller’s questioning of officials about Comey’s firing suggests he’s looking into obstruction of justice allegations, The Washington Post noted on Tuesday.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Mueller’s team has also spoken to Comey and to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the probe because of conversations he’d had with Russia’s U.S. ambassador. According to the Times, Comey was questioned about memos he had written during his time as FBI director about his interactions with the president.

The Justice Department confirmed on Tuesday that Sessions was interviewed in the probe. According to NBC, “numerous members of Trump’s campaign and White House inner circle” have also been questioned.

NBC’s report shows that Trump Cabinet members were involved with Mueller’s investigation far earlier than previously known. Until Wednesday, Sessions was the only member of Trump’s Cabinet known to have been questioned by Mueller’s team.

Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has indicated he will cooperate with Mueller’s team. It’s unclear if Trump himself will be interviewed.

Four former Trump advisers, including ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, have been charged in connection with the investigation.-1

The House passed the deal later on Monday, and President Donald Trump signed the bill that same evening, effectively ending the shutdown.

Senators voted 81-18 for a three-week funding measure to reopen the government, with many Democrats saying they felt encouraged by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) assurance over the weekend that the Senate would proceed to an immigration bill soon.

Democrats insisted they weren’t caving, even though they didn’t get what they wanted: an immediate vote on protections for undocumented young people often called Dreamers. But the deal gave them a way out of what could have been a politically damaging shutdown. The promise of a vote on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, although it could be reneged on, is something Democrats didn’t have before. It’s the first time Democrats received a firm deadline for a vote on an immigration bill. And if McConnell doesn’t follow through, Democrats will be able to use this promise to vote against the next spending bill and pin the blame on Republicans.

If McConnell keeps his word, he’ll put Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in a tough spot. There is a DACA bill currently working its way through the House that would deliver on a number of conservative immigration priorities, but it has no chance in the Senate.

If senators are able to pass their own bill, while simultaneously demonstrating that the House bill doesn’t have the votes to pass in their chamber, Ryan will be left with the choice of either putting the Senate bill up for a vote and angering conservatives or holding strong. If he holds strong and doesn’t put the Senate-passed measure up for a vote, he could risk another shutdown and strengthen the Democrats’ argument that another government closure is the fault of Republican obstructionism.

“I don’t think I can guarantee a House outcome but I think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill ― the odds go up in the House,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told HuffPost.

For now, Democrats were happy to end a government shutdown, fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, and functionally not give up any of their leverage.

Although CHIP had bipartisan support, Congress had failed to renew it. Part of the reason is that there were disagreements over how to pay for it, with some GOP proposals undercutting Obamacare in the process.

McConnell reiterated Monday morning that he would move to vote on an immigration bill if the two sides can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open.

“It would be my intention to take up legislation here in the Senate that would address DACA, border security, and related issues as well as disaster relief, defense funding, health care, and other important matters,” McConnell said. “It would be my strong preference for the Senate to consider a proposal that can actually be signed into law, a bipartisan, bicameral group is already negotiating, and I look forward to completion of its work.”

Some Democrats took McConnell’s remarks as a step toward their preferred solution. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said it represented “a path forward that is enormously smoother.”

“I believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,” independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters Monday. “I think he’s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally, particularly this morning ― which was a stronger statement than last night ― it’d be very difficult for him to try to find a way out of meeting that commitment.”

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), however, was not convinced by McConnell’s assurances that he would hold a vote on an immigration bill in the future.

“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” Harris said.

The federal government has been shut down since early Saturday because the Senate didn’t approve a deal on the four-week spending bill needed to keep it open. Forty-four Democrats and four Republicans voted against that bill, with many saying they wouldn’t support anything that didn’t help the 700,000 undocumented young people Trump put at risk of losing deportation protections when he ended DACA. Other lawmakers who voted “no” said short-term spending bills are a bad way to operate the government.

Immigrant rights groups have been urging Democrats to demand Dreamer relief as part of must-pass spending bills since Trump rescinded DACA. Their logic ― based on years of experience ― is that a standalone bill to help Dreamers will languish if it’s not attached to another measure because Republican leaders won’t give it a vote, even if it has the support to pass.

McConnell’s promise convinced some Democrats to switch their vote. But he wasn’t able to make any guarantees about the House, as Ryan previously promised the conservative Freedom Caucus he would not hold immigration votes without support from a majority of the Republican conference.

Trump could also throw the entire deal into disarray. He rejected an offer from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Friday to fund a border wall ― something Democrats have said they would not accept ― in exchange for Dreamer protections, according to Schumer. Since the shutdown, White House officials have said they would not negotiate on immigration issues.

In a speech on the Senate floor announcing that his caucus would vote to move forward, Schumer said he hadn’t spoken with Trump since their Friday meeting at the White House ― before the government shut down. “The great deal-making president sat on the sidelines,” he said.

Dreamer activists called on Democrats earlier Monday to not settle for McConnell’s promise to hold a vote. If they lose DACA ― as an estimated 122 Dreamers already are each day ― they will lose work permits and could be deported.

“Promises won’t protect anyone from deportation because delay means deportations for us,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for the Dreamer-led group United We Dream, said on a call with reporters ahead of the vote.

The Democratic senators who voted against the measure were: Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Patrick Leahy (Vt.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Robert Menendez (N.J.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Chris Murphy (Conn.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Ron Wyden (Ore.).

On the Republican side, Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.) also voted against it.

Up to 58 refugees being held at Australia’s offshore detention facility on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island will fly to the United States on Tuesday. Refugee advocates in Australia told HuffPost that 40 refugees had already left Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby, on Tuesday morning local time, with another 18 thought to be departing later on a separate plane. The refugees were living at the Manus Island facilities, which house only men, and had been detained by Australia for several years after trying to reach the mainland by boat. The refugees will be flown to Manila in the Philippines before the group is set to be split in two, with some people reportedly flying to Los Angeles and others to New York. Ian Rintoul, of the Refugee Action Coalition, told HuffPost he believed the men ― among them Rohingyas, Afghans and Pakistanis ― would be settled in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and unspecified parts of North Carolina. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment.

This is the second contingent of refugees to be transferred to the U.S. under a resettlement agreement between the Obama administration and the Australian government in 2016. Last September, 50 people being held on Manus and Nauru islands were also moved. Australia’s hard-line immigration policies include sending people seeking asylum by boat to offshore detention camps for processing, with successive governments pledging that nobody arriving by boat can ever be resettled in Australia. Refugees are permitted to resettle in either Papua New Guinea or Nauru, but have no prospect of being admitted to Australia. The U.S. resettlement deal was seen as a way to get refugees off the poor and under-resourced Pacific islands without allowing them into Australia. “It was a bittersweet moment for the refugees who, on the one hand, are happy to be gaining the freedom that Australia denied them more than four years ago, but on the other, they remain extremely concerned for those that are being left behind,” Rintoul said. The Refugee Action Coalition shared a statement from one of the refugees, who said he was “very happy to be free of the hell that the Australian government made for us on Manus.” “But we are sad for those who are still waiting so long. We can’t stop thinking of everyone who are still on Manus. We all need freedom,” the unidentified man added. The resettlement arrangement was the subject of an early, infamous phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last January, where Trump called the arrangement under his predecessor “an embarrassment,” “rotten” and “stupid.” Referring to the refugees, Trump asked, “Are they going to become the Boston bomber in five years?” according to a transcript of the conversation published by The Washington Post. In the conversation and a later tweet, Trump appeared to be unaware of the scope of the deal, claiming he had “heard five thousand” people were to be involved. Turnbull stated that the deal was for up to 1,250 refugees.

Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017

Refugees from Australia’s other offshore facility, on the Pacific island of Nauru, are also involved in the resettlement deal. On Monday, around 500 of them ― men, women and children who had not yet been allowed to leave ― signed a letter to the Australian government asking for more information on their status. Rintoul said U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials were currently on Nauru assessing claims, but were not providing any updates. “We have no answers about what will happen to our future. Our lives are in limbo,” the letter read. “We are getting more helpless and hopeless. More people are becoming mentally sick. More people are self-harming from despair ... we demand [the government] provides us with full information about the US deal and when the next group of people will go to the US.”

Just 42 people now hold as much wealth as the poorest 3.7 billion, the organization said.

In the U.S., the country’s three richest people have the same wealth as the poorest half of the American population. The report called out President Donald Trump for policies that contribute to wealth inequality.

The world saw the biggest increase in billionaires in history in the year prior to March 2017, with a new one added every two days, according to Oxfam’s figures. The world now has 2,043 billionaires, and nine of every 10 are men.

Billionaire wealth has risen by an annual average of 13 percent since 2010 — while the average worker’s wage has risen an average of 2 percent. While billionaire income was booming last year, the poorest half of the world saw no increase in wealth, according to the report, “Reward Work, Not Wealth.”

Oxfam issued the annual report on Monday, a day before the start of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, which Trump plans to attend.

The Oxfam report specifically criticizes Trump for creating “a cabinet of billionaires” and for “pushing for huge tax cuts for the richest 1 percent” in the new tax law.

The Oxfam report, which is based on data from Forbes and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth datebook, blamed the wealth gap on tax evasion, corporations’ increasing influence on policy, erosion of workers’ rights, and cost cutting.-1

MURFREESBORO, Tenn. ― We spotted our tail not long after the neo-Nazi rally ended: a black GMC Sierra pickup with tinted windows and silver trim. In my rear-view mirror, I could see the outlines of two men in the cab: big dudes with military haircuts and bull necks ― not-fucking-around types. I turned left slowly. So did the pickup. At the end of the next block, I turned right. The pickup did too. “Is that truck with you guys?” I asked Corey Lemley, an anti-fascist activist sitting in the passenger seat of my rental car. Lemley turned to look out the back window. “Nope.” It was the last weekend of October, and I’d come to middle Tennessee to cover a pair of “White Lives Matter” rallies thrown by several of the white supremacist groups responsible for the deadly carnage in Charlottesville in August. The League of the South, a Southern separatist group, had taken the lead in organizing the rallies, with support from other groups, including Matt Heimbach’s Traditionalist Worker Party, a neo-Nazi outfit. Heimbach’s Nazis are returning to Tennessee to protest the Women’s March taking place in Knoxville on Sunday. The Nazis plan to attach themselves to a competing anti-abortion “March for Life” rally. How this will pan out for the fascists is anyone’s guess, but back in October, things didn’t go well for them in the Volunteer State. Heimbach’s crew started a fight with a biracial couple in a Brentwood pub. And their two rallies only put a spotlight on the weakness of their movement and the strength of their opposition. The second event, in Murfreesboro, was a total flop. Heimbach’s Nazis bailed, scared off by hundreds of counter-demonstrators who descended on Murfreesboro’s main square. I’d been standing with those counter-demonstrators at the end of the rally when the crowd parted for a black-clad column of activists marching from the square ― Lemley’s crew, 50 militant anti-fascists, some of them members of Nashville Anti-Racist Action. (Many of the people in Lemley’s network will mobilize again to confront Heimbach anew.) People gawked and took photos. The ARA had a different air about them. They were ready to throw down. They were ready to go. Many had strips of tape across their chests with “Heather” written on them in tribute to Heather Heyer, the anti-fascist killed in Charlottesville when a car plowed into a crowd. A white supremacist has been charged with murder in the case. “Murfreesboro, we got your back!” shouted one ARA member, as Lemley and the troop made their way down the street. His fellow antifa roared in response, “We got your back! We got your back!” I’d interviewed Lemley a few days earlier over the phone. He was the local antifa front man, in part because he’d been organizing publicly in the Nashville area for months after white supremacists doxed him. We’d arranged to do a post-rally interview, this one on camera, and Lemley gave me the address of a safe house where I could pick him up to drive him to a HuffPost video team. But when I’d arrived in my Ford Fusion Hybrid ― which, notably, allows a motorist to trade engine performance for efficiency with the push of an “EcoSelect” button ― I saw multiple police cruisers circling ominously through the quiet neighborhood. Vehicles with tinted windows idled at intersections. I would later learn that a drone had hovered over the safe house before the rally. The GMC, though, was a more pressing concern. As soon as Lemley and another ARA member got into my car, the black pickup had appeared, right behind us, not even feigning subtlety after we doubled back on a side street. “They’re definitely following us,” I said. I stamped on the pedal of the Fusion and made a quick turn at a stop sign, then another one at a light. The GMC sped up and stayed on us. How was this possible? Murfreesboro was crawling with cops. Where were they now? And who was on our tail? This wasn’t Heimbach’s style. I swung abruptly across traffic and pulled into a driveway across the street, leaving no way for the GMC to follow. The men in the pickup would have to make a move now. They drove past us and stopped. It looked like they were about to get out. Lemley reached into a backpack at his feet. “If they want it, they can get it,” he said. He pulled out a .40 caliber Sig Sauer P226. The gun chk-chkd as he chambered a round.

Corey Lemley Corey Lemley (in black beanie) of Nashville ARA defends a line of clergy during the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, 2017.

I’d been talking to antifa for months, hearing about the risks they took to fight fascism in America. Last April, somebody put a quarter stick of dynamite in Lemley’s mailbox and blew it to bits. In August, he’d been on the front lines in Charlottesville, part of an antifa defensive unit that fought off a battalion of League of the South racists who charged with weapons and shields at a group of clergy. (“Antifa saved my life twice,” said Rev. Seth Wispelwey, a local minister.) The danger didn’t seem real until you experienced it. And the shock had less to do with the potential for bloodshed in America than the realization that organized political violence isn’t some distant, foreign problem. And that forces within our own country have stoked it. Over the last year, far-right propagandists such as Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec have hyped antifa hysteria on social media, using the most garish images and examples of antifa dust-ups with racists and fascists to demonize the entirety of the left, as well as centrist liberals, the media and anyone who might challenge President Donald Trump’s MAGA agenda. Around the time I was in Murfreesboro, one of these operatives, Jeff Giesea, a Stanford University graduate and Peter Thiel associate who has, according to several of my sources, acted as a paymaster for far-right extremists online, tweeted that I, too, was antifa, then lied about it when I challenged him. For conservatives, antifa are a convenient bogeyman, a faceless “commie” mob that allows the political right to engage in “both sides” rhetoric and distract from dangerous elements in the Republican base. There are reasons beyond gun sales that political organizations such as the National Rifle Association fearmonger about anti-fascists and invoke anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about George Soros mailing them checks. These lies, which create an easy out-group to hate, have permeated the minds of many on the right. But I’d spent long hours getting to know antifa, and although they tended to be ardent personalities, their motivation was simple: to combat fascism, racism, misogyny, intolerance and inequality. Their tactics could, at times, be worrisome, and their anarchist and anti-capitalist views occasionally prompted a few of them to break the window of a Starbucks. As a result, they were vilified as a threat to the system in a way that violent white supremacist and fascist organizations, which routinely commit acts of domestic terrorism, were not.

Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.’s!

Trump has steadfastly blamed Democrats for the shutdown that began Friday night after Congress was unable to agree on short-term funding for the federal government, despite his party’s majority grip on the House and Senate.

In his tweet Sunday, Trump pushed for an end to a Senate filibuster currently blocking a vote on the budget. It normally takes a supermajority of 60 senators out of the full 100 to end a filibuster and pass legislation. But Trump suggested Republicans override the opposing Democrats by using the “nuclear option,” which would allow a simple majority of 51 senators to end the filibuster and pass a long-term budget.

The nuclear option has been used just two times in the history of the Senate. In 2013, Senate Democrats used it to eliminate filibusters on executive branch and federal judicial appointments outside of the Supreme Court. In 2017, Trump encouraged Senate Republicans to use it to end filibusters on Supreme Court appointments as well, effectively advancing Justice Neil Gorsuch’s appointment to the bench.

During an appearance Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the government shutdown proves the Senate should kill the filibuster rule all together.

“We’ve been critical of that 60-vote rule since the president took office,” Mulvaney said. “I think what the president did this morning was try to shed some light on the fact that if ordinary rules prevailed, the majority ruled in the Senate, the government would be open today.”

But the Senate has long been held up as the “world’s greatest deliberative body” and many of its members, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.,) worry ending the filibuster rule would threaten its integrity.

“I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers,” Durbin said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

“We have to acknowledge a respect for the minority and that’s what the Senate tries to do in its composition and in its procedure,” he continued.-1

His comments directly contradicted his chief of staff John Kelly , who reportedly told Democratic congressional leaders that Trump had softened his views on the wall because he had previously been “uninformed.”

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Thursday used Twitter to add confusion to his stance on two key issues, one day before Congress’ deadline for passing legislation to keep the government open .

We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!

In a Fox News interview later that day, Kelly similarly said that Trump has “changed the way he’s looked at a number of things,” and did not deny the reports of what he said at the Capitol Hill meeting, which congressional Democrats confirmed.

“There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through,” Kelly said.

Trump has been using the wall as a bargaining chip in negotiations over how to deal with undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Democrats, who oppose the wall, have been pushing for a so-called clean bill that allows these immigrants to stay in the U.S. Without such a bill, they have threatened to not support a government funding bill.

Trump was angry following Kelly’s interview, according to CNN.

Trump in his tweets also bucked GOP congressional leaders, saying that funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which has also been hanging in the balance, should be included in future legislation, not a short-term bill funding the government.-1

But critics have pushed back, as city life appears to be bustling along as usual. Many local leaders see racism behind the alarmism.

Recent reports of a wave of violence at the hands of young Africans in Australia’s second largest city, Melbourne, have sparked a national debate and a fierce political fight about how to deal with the issue, but also whether there is a problem at all. Over the holiday break, Australia’s conservative media outlets reported extensively on a wave of violent crimes ― the robbery of a group of tourists, damage inside a McDonald’s restaurant, a wild party that trashed a rented home and terrorized neighbors, and an assault on a police officer at a shopping center. They blamed the incidents on “African gangs.”

An “African gang” problem has long been a hot-button issue in the state of Victoria, with conservative media, commentators and politicians claiming the situation is widespread, while police and state government officials downplay concerns. Sudanese and Somali refugees have recently settled in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Australia’s second most populated city. And for several years, Melbourne media have reported on the so-called Apex gang, a group of young African men allegedly linked to a string of violent crime including carjackings, home invasions, brazen robberies and riots across Melbourne. The gang issue went relatively quiet for several months, with police claiming the gangs were a “non-entity” after leaders and key members were arrested and jailed. But the recent reports were quickly picked up across the country, sparking a fierce spat between national and state political leaders. Following the events, the state of Victoria’s left-leaning Labor government resisted calls to label the incidents as gang-related. State police said the young people involved in these crimes did not fit the standard profile of criminal gang members, lacking organization and sophistication. Australia’s conservative government, however, disagreed. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton have criticized the Victorian government and even claimed the “political correctness” of the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, was to blame for the crime wave. The federal government criticisms come despite the most recent Victorian crime statistics showing a reduction in property damage, burglary and theft. Robbery figures rose by 12 percent in the last 24 months, but all other major crime categories remained stable, according to the state’s Crime Statistics Agency. Dutton said in a radio interview on Jan. 3 that “of course it’s African gang violence,” and claimed people in Melbourne are “scared to go out to restaurants in the nighttime.” Many residents refuted the claims ― including State Treasurer Tim Pallas, whose west Melbourne electorate is one of the areas where incidents are taking place. The Victorian government has now established a task force with members of the African community to work alongside police to not only tackle youth crime, but also deal with incidents of racism or vilification directed at people of African descent. “We know that the vast majority of African-Australians in Victoria are decent, law-abiding people,” Victoria’s police commissioner, Graham Ashton, said in a statement. “They are suffering as a result of the actions of a small cohort of young offenders. The African-Australian Community can, and want to, play a role in providing solutions.”

Hey @PeterDutton_MP - quick note from Victoria. Our cafes and restaurants are going great. Thought you should know #springstpic.twitter.com/gcWMyf4Wo4 — Tim Pallas (@timpallas) January 11, 2018

Ashton said it was “complete and utter garbage” to say Melbourne was not a safe place. “Victoria is one of the safest places in the world to live,” the Victoria police commissioner said at a press conference last week. “I don’t think anyone is sitting at home cowering with the sheets over their heads.” “If you put it into context, you’ve got a few hundred offenders engaged in offending in a city of 4 ½ million people,” he added. “We have some young people that are engaging in ... gang-related behaviors, we’re not shying away from that, but I think it’s important we keep it in perspective.” The Victorian state government, arguably the most progressive in the nation, and the federal government have long been at loggerheads over social issues including refugees, domestic violence and energy policy. The federal government sees the state and Premier Andrews as soft on crime and immigration. Andrews has publicly castigated the federal government’s harsh policies on refugees and offshore detention. 2018 is an election year in Victoria, and some commentators see the federal intervention into the gangs issue ― a state government responsibility ― as a ploy to boost the chances of the conservative opposition winning office from the left-leaning incumbents. While Melbourne residents met Home Minister Dutton’s hyperbolic remark with ridicule, the government’s rhetoric had real-life repercussions. South Sudanese and Somali community leaders warned that the federal government’s stance on the issue further perpetuated stereotyping of the community. South Sudanese community leader Kot Monoah accused the federal government of “scaremongering” on the issue, claiming not enough was being done to help educate and integrate African migrants and families. “The current youth crisis has been in the making for the last 14 years,” he said in a TV interview last week. On Wednesday, David Anei, a Brisbane resident of Somali decent, posted a video of an angry, verbally abusive and physically imposing man he claimed had followed him and his family home. Anei put the blame squarely on Dutton’s and Turnbull’s shoulders. “[They bear] full responsibility for this racial attack on my family because they chose to be in the office to serve certain group of Australian communities NOT Australia as a whole country,” he wrote on Facebook. On Thursday, the government’s Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission criticized the federal allegations and called on Victorians to “take a stand against racism and discrimination in the community.” “Misleading claims of an African gang crisis in Victoria ― refuted by the Chief Commissioner of Police ― have already spurred race-based hate and threats towards African Victorians,” the EOHRC said. The issue of “African gangs” has been a favorite of Australia’s conservative tabloid newspapers and TV stations for years. Reports peaked in 2016, when a group of young men of African descent dubbed the Apex gang sparked a round of street fighting during a Melbourne community festival. The group was later accused of being behind a series of carjackings, home invasions and robberies in Melbourne. While police say the gang had about 130 members at its peak, the deputy commissioner of Victoria Police said the group had become a “non-entity” by April 2017. Police say this remains the case today, but graffiti tags of the words Apex and MTS ― standing for Menace To Society, another group allegedly linked to the series of crimes ― were found at the scene of some of the recent incidents.

Some residents are taking matters into their own hands. A group of far-right activists calling themselves the True Blue Crew, just one of several “patriot” organizations active in Victoria, held a clandestine meeting last weekend to discuss how they can “take a stand on the streets” against the gang issue. The group was previously focused on anti-Muslim activities. The Soldiers Of Odin, another group linked to the True Blue Crew and neo-Nazis, had previously operated its own “street patrols” in Melbourne after earlier concerns about gang violence. On social media, members of the African community pushed back by reclaiming the term “African gangs” with a hashtag showing how members of the African community are valuable, committed members of society.

The controversy has also laid bare stark differences about how the government should respond to the economic woes of some African immigrants. While the federal government has blamed recent crimes on a failure of African youths to “integrate” into Australian society, community leaders point to poverty and other social issues among the migrant enclaves in Melbourne’s less wealthy outer suburbs. Unemployment rates among Melbourne residents of Sudanese, South Sudanese and Somali backgrounds have hovered between 25 percent and 30 percent, according to the 2016 census.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Trump speaks by phone with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the Oval Office on Jan. 28. (Seated across from him are two advisers who have since left the White House, Michael Flynn and Steve Bannon.)

Australia Almost immediately after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, the White House laid out his “America First” foreign policy. It also claimed, “The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies.” Days later, Trump held one of his first official phone calls with the leader of an allied nation, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Their conversation did not end well. Turnbull pressed Trump to uphold the U.S. end of an agreement with Australia. The deal, which had been negotiated by President Barack Obama, required the U.S. to accept a number of refugees from the Australian offshore detention centers on Nauru and Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island. “This deal will make me look terrible. ... I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made,” Trump said. Turnbull calmly and repeatedly attempted to explain elements of the agreement that Trump seemed to misunderstand. But Trump had no time for that. “I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,” he said, before abruptly ending the conversation. China After a rocky start, Trump’s relationship with China has remained turbulent. In January, Rex Tillerson, then the nominee for U.S. secretary of state, said China should be denied access to islands that it had built in the South China Sea. Unsurprisingly, this provocative stance enraged Beijing. Trump has complained again and again about the country’s apparent unwillingness to help rein in a hostile North Korea. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump tweeted on Jan. 2, before his inauguration. “North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been ‘playing’ the United States for years. China has done little to help!” he reiterated in March. He hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at the White House in April, and the two “developed a very good relationship,” according to Trump, who subsequently seemed to change his tune on China’s efforts regarding Pyongyang.

North Korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor, China, by shooting off yet another ballistic missile...but China is trying hard! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2017

But only briefly.

I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017

Despite Trump’s claim that China could “easily” deal with North Korea, it is, of course, not that easy. France In the wake of deadly terrorist attacks in the French cities of Nice and Paris, Trump suggested that France’s capital had been stripped of its identity. “Take a look at what’s happened in France. I have a friend; he’s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the city of lights. He loves Paris. Hadn’t seen him in a while,” Trump said in February. “And I said, ‘Jim, let me ask you a question. How’s Paris doing?’ [To which he replied:] ‘Paris? I don’t go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris.’” An Associated Press report concluded that “Jim” likely does not exist. Trump’s insensitive remarks angered François Hollande, who was the president of France at the time. “There is terrorism and we must fight it together. I think that it is never good to show the smallest defiance toward an allied country,” Hollande said. “I wouldn’t do it with the United States and I‘m urging the U.S. president not to do it with France.” Germany Trump’s relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been frosty. During a meeting at the White House last March, a reporter requested that the two leaders shake hands for a photograph. Merkel smiled and looked over at Trump, who was sitting right beside her, but he ignored her gaze and declined to shake her hand.

The next day, he dismissed reports that the meeting had been awkward and then tweeted that Germany owes “vast sums of money to NATO & the United States,” which is false. The president’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, also accused Berlin of manipulating its currency to “exploit” the U.S. dollar. In December 2015, Trump had accused Merkel of “ruining Germany” by welcoming a large number of Syrian refugees into the country. He also described the key American ally as a “total mess” on the campaign trail. Iran Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have clashed several times over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal. The 2015 agreement between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (including the U.S.), Germany and the European Union requires Tehran to rein in its nuclear program in exchange for relief from stifling economic sanctions. Long opposed to the deal, Trump put Iran “on notice” and accused the country of “playing with fire” after an Iranian missile test last February.

Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them. Not me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017

Speaking before the U.N. in September, Rouhani, in turn, suggested that Trump’s rhetoric was “ignorant” and “absurd” and that his administration was made up of “rogue newcomers to the world of politics.” After Trump decertified the nuclear deal in October and left its fate up to Congress, European leaders raced to defend and salvage the landmark agreement. Iran is also among the Muslim-majority nations directly affected by Trump’s internationally condemned travel ban. Mexico In the many months since his infamous campaign remarks that when Mexico “sends its people ... they’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,” Trump has continued to disparage Mexicans. He cited a widely disputed study calling Mexico the second deadliest country in the world in an attempt to justify his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The multibillion-dollar wall, which Trump claims Mexico will pay for, has been an extremely divisive issue. It led Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to cancel his first official meeting with Trump in January. And Mexico still firmly denies that it will fund any such construction. North Korea Trump’s war of words with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has grown increasingly hostile as he seeks a way to clamp down on Pyongyang’s advancing nuclear program. The taunts and provocations between the two leaders have even stirred fears of a nuclear war. In September, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, which is home to an estimated 25 million people. He also referred to Kim as “Rocket Man” and said the rogue nation’s leader was on “a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” Many of the president’s tweets and statements about North Korea have hinted at imminent military action. They’ve even appeared to undermine his administration’s own diplomatic efforts.

Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017

United Kingdom Trump strained America’s relationship with one of its closest allies, the United Kingdom, by accusing Britain’s spy agency of wiretapping him during the U.S. presidential election under direction from Obama. He offered no evidence whatsoever for this unsubstantiated claim and later declined to apologize.

John MacDougall/Pool/Reuters Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May wait at the start of the first working session of the G-20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7.

But Trump was quick to politicize a terrorist attack at a London subway station in September that injured dozens of people: He suggested that the city’s police force could have done more to prevent the incident. “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate about what is an ongoing investigation,” said British Prime Minister Theresa May, following Trump’s remarks. “The police and security services are working to discover the full circumstances of this cowardly attack and to identify all those responsible.” A few months earlier, Trump had pulled London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s words out of context in the wake of another deadly terrorist attack there. Khan had attempted to reassure London residents that the situation was under control and told them not to be alarmed by the increased police presence in the area following the attack. Trump implied that the mayor was taking terrorism lightly:

At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017

He doubled down on this baseless criticism the next day:

Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017

This list of nations and their leaders slammed by Trump is, astonishingly, far from comprehensive. With so many insults in so little time, it’s tough to believe it’s been only a year since his election.-1

Mr Collins conceded that, in hindsight, "we need even additional ... spare drivers", while Labor and the unions blamed the widespread disruption on an overhaul of the rail timetable in November.

There was no good news for commuters on Wednesday morning, as more train cancellations across the train network threaten to delay those heading to work.

Some trains from Hornsby to Central, Central to Epping, Central to Gordon and Macarthur to Central were cancelled before 8am due to staff availability issues.

A lack of staff, plus damage to rail infrastructure caused by lightning strikes, resulted in major delays to services on multiple rail lines on Tuesday, a day after at least 18 services had to be cancelled due to insufficient numbers of drivers and guards.

Passengers faced long queues and overcrowded platforms at Sydney's main stations including Wynyard, Town Hall and Central during the evening peak on Tuesday as the impact of the delays rippled across the rail network. Passengers were temporarily stopped from entering some platforms to avoid dangerous overcrowding.

Commuters were advised to delay any non-essential travel and use local bus routes where possible due to the "extended delays continuing throughout the evening".

Tuesday's chaos was the second time in a month that the network has faced severe levels of disruption during the evening peak.

But with demand for public transport surging, Mr Collins said deferring the timetable changes in November would have resulted in people experiencing greater crowding and delays.

"The choice we had was trying to do a service with not enough capacity, people bitterly complaining about crowding on several lines [and] about not being able to get on trains, particularly on weekends," he said.

"[But] we have seen an improved service, particularly at weekends [from the new timetable]. It is true to say that, when big incidents occur, the service takes longer to recover."

Leaked internal documents have revealed that the new timetable has reduced the flexibility in the system to recover from delays caused by major incidents.

Decades-old S-set trains are being pressed into service more often to allow Sydney Trains to put on the 1500 extra weekly services rolled out as part of the timetable changes. It means passengers face uncomfortable journeys on hot summer days because those trains are not airconditioned.

Mr Collins admitted the "awful S-sets" were "not acceptable", but he said they would begin to be replaced from June with 24 new Waratah trains, the first of which is due to be shipped from China next month.

"By next summer, all those S-sets, I want to make sure are gone," he said.

On Tuesday, the T1 North Shore, Northern and Western line suffered "major delays" due both a lack of staff and lightning strikes damaging signalling equipment at Gordon in Sydney's north.

The T2 Inner West and Leppington, the T3 Bankstown and the T8 Airport and South lines also had major disruptions because of the lack of staff and the need for urgent repairs to signal equipment at Yagoona in the city's west.

The lack of drivers also forced Sydney Trains to use buses instead of trains on the T6 Carlingford and T7 Olympic Park lines for periods of the day.

About 70 train crew called in sick on Tuesday. In all, Sydney Trains has about 3000 train crew.

Labor leader Luke Foley said the new rail timetable was "not worth the paper it's written on" because the train services were "shambolic right now".

"At the moment you have to say our public train system is shambolic in its delivery. If they're this bad now, what will they be in a month's time when everyone is back at work," he said.

But Transport Minister Andrew Constance said Labor was "conveniently ignoring" the new metro and light rail lines under construction, new ferries and thousands of extra buses "making journeys easier".

"In total, $41.5 billion of transport infrastructure is being delivered, after Labor did nothing for 16 years," he said.

The prospect of thousands of rail workers taking industrial action also looms over Sydney Trains and NSW Trains over the coming months.

A ballot of rail workers on whether to take protected industrial action during the negotiating period is due to be released later this week.

The unions representing rail staff have been pushing for a pay rise of 6 per cent a year over the term of a new agreement, which is significantly higher than the 2.5 per cent annual increase Sydney Trains has put on the table.

Mr Collins said most commuters would be "aghast" at what the unions were seeking, but Rail Tram and Bus Union state secretary Alex Claassens said the claim for a 6 per cent rise was a "starting point" in the negotiations which began six months ago.

Mr Claassens said there had been an increase of about 2 per cent in the number of drivers and guards who called in sick over the past two days.

"We have always said we needed extra services. The problem is that ... there are no spare trains in the system and there are no spare drivers and guards," he said.

Sydney's rail network will face one of its biggest tests late this year when the Epping-to-Chatswood line in the city's north is closed for seven months to allow for it to be converted to carry single-deck metro trains.-1

It is a truth universally acknowledged that nobody has ever had a good New Year's Eve at a party, nightclub or hotel. You might have thought you did once, but I'm sorry to say you are mistaken. The preparation, the far-too-high expectations you put on yourself and your night, the stress of whether to line up a midnight kiss or proudly go into the new year as an independent woman/man who don't need no woman/man -- it all gets too much, honestly. Far better to pack up the car, wrangle a few mates and retreat into the bush for a few days of fun and music, only to return to the real world once the new year is here, emerging like the beautiful butterfly you know you are.

Lost Paradise, in the stunningly gorgeous Glenworth Valley just north of Sydney, is one of dozens of New Year's Eve festivals that currently run around Australia every year. If you've got the time, energy and money to do it, these types of big, loud, fun music festivals are probably the best option of a bad bunch for ending your year -- no need to organise transport, house parties, nightclub tickets or entry queues, or pick between a bevy of options in search of the 'coolest' way to ring in the new year. Pack a tent, a spare pair of undies and a metric tonne of glitter (more on that later) and you're sweet.

Punters dance at the Lost Disco tent

Last year, we described Lost Paradise 2016 as "like a big backyard party that just spiralled out of control; in the best way possible," and "sitting somewhere between a bush doof on a big budget, and a big festival but minus all the unnecessary bells and whistles." In 2017, the vibe remained loose and casual, fun and relaxed, but with a few big makeovers -- a few impressive new stages including as submarine parked on the edge of the river to allow those swimming and lazing on inflatables to groove while staying cool in the blistering summer heat, more food and bars, hammocks dotted through the grounds, a far-expanded Shambala Fields spiritual area full of massage and yoga classes, and a bevy of new roaming entertainment from a mobile disco to acrobats.

It's not too much of a stretch to say that you could have an incredible time at Lost Paradise without seeing a single band, so overflowing were the side attractions.

Nevertheless, we're here for the music. Meg Mac is the first act we catch on the main stage, and she's belting through a beautiful, haunting performance accompanied by a small choir of backing singers. She's one of Australia's most beloved young performers, and she's on-form here tonight, but she's kind of the wrong vibe for a festival otherwise comprised of dance music and upbeat rockers, and not exactly the perfect fit for getting punters amped for the night ahead.

San Cisco did a better job, their sweet indie-pop numbers getting crowds jumping and dancing into the early evening, before British visitor Nadia Rose turned things up a few notches with her high energy London hip-hop and grime vibes. This was far more to the audience's liking. With an all-female support crew in her DJ and hypewoman, the MC confidently strutted the stage on her first Australian visit.

Day one headliners Rufus took to the stage, shrouded in darkness, amidst swirling smoke and pulsing lights, and turned in a typically entrancing, beguiling set of dreamy, melancholic dance-pop. The trio are now veterans of the late night festival slot, so this wasn't much that we hadn't seen before, but their performance never gets any less interesting or bewitching -- retro 80s-style synths, crooning vocals, driving beats and a stunning light show form the bedrock of the Rufus sound, which can equally inspire enthusiastic dancing or quiet, introspective swaying, depending what point of the night you're personally at.

Their mysterious sound pulsed through the forest late into the night, mingling later with the old-time bangers coming from the most popular new addition to Lost Paradise -- 'Your Mum's Disco'.

The standard scene at Your Mum's Disco, no matter the time of day (or night)

A wooden cabin equipped with stereo speakers and an iPad, but no DJ, Mum's Disco drew the most passionate crowd of the weekend. Why, you may ask? Because the iPad was linked up to a Spotify playlist of retro classic guilty pleasures like 'Nutbush City Limits', the Venga Boys and Dolly Parton, with punters encouraged to queue up their favourites for the crowd to enjoy. Lo-fi, but high fun.

Lost Paradise is famous for its costumes. Each year, organisers ask punters to embrace the 'escape' element of the festival so evident in its hidden location and spiritual focus -- no grungy skate shoes or sweaty singlets here, instead a sea of festival-goers dressed as angels and devils, echoing butterflies and birds, men and women alike decked head-to-toe in glitter, glow sticks, flowing loose dresses, lurid makeup, fluoro wigs and shiny alien-like clothes. In between, others opted for NBA team uniforms, some dressed as Popes or clergy, and one clever group came as an entire Mario Kart race, complete with cardboard racecars around their waists. The must-have accessories were oriental-style paper umbrellas, while a competition for best totem pole saw huge flags and light displays looming high above the crowds at any given moment.

The genius Mario Kart crew

Skegss would have been the first act of the second day for many at 4.30pm, after a scorching morning saw most retreat into the river or scuttle under the nearest shade structure. As the sun dipped behind the mountains and heat finally relented in the valley bowl, fans were met with a bizarre and frankly disappointing set from the slacker rockers, with near-incoherent stage banter and a set of droning, unimaginative surf-pop songs near-indistinguishable from one another. The trio managed an upbeat and energetic set, but channelled their energy into jumping around the stage and bouncing off one another rather than coming up with stage banter beyond "everyone having a good time?" and "who's having fun?" Skeggs are an entertaining proposition on record, their summer-drenched rock tunes dripping of sun and surf, but they disappointingly proved little more than a noisy distraction today.

Suddenly it's 9pm and I'm eating a kebab at Mum's Disco while dancing to Outkast's 'Hey Ya' with a group of girls dressed as Ghostbusters. The ironic banger tunes don't let up - Daryl Braithwaite's 'Horses', Neil Diamond's 'Sweet Caroline', Dolly Parton's 'Jolene', every word shouted and screamed into the ink-black night sky. Somehow, Sophie Ellis Bextor's 'Murder On The Dance Floor' played every time I was there, but who's complaining? Mum's Disco had the perfect spot, nestled snugly between the bars, the food and the other larger stages, meaning most punters had to wander past at several points in the day, and it never failed to disappoint. Who knew that young adults would pay several hundred dollars for a ticket to a music festival, but remain highly entertained by a Spotify playlist of songs from before they were born?

Sampa The Great and Little Dragon entertained on the main stage with colourful and upbeat sets of hip-hop, electronic and soul-tinged dance-friendly tunes, but the night belonged to Sydney rockers DMA's who put in arguably the best set of the weekend. With huge euphoric singalong choruses unashamedly inspired by Britpop heroes Oasis and Blur, and with a fashion style maybe best described as 'lost and found bin at suburban op shop', they didn't exactly fit the bill for the glitter and glam-filled festival, but they blew many away. Serving up anthemic rock songs, full of passion and feeling, DMA's would have converted many fence-sitters into full-blown fans as they clsoed out the main stage.

Day three, the final day and New Year's Eve itself, saw Dean Lewis bring his emotion-charged folk-pop songs to hungover crowds early in the afternoon. Seemingly every one of his plaintive, confessional songs are about lost love and heartache, or at least a lovelorn over-emotional teenager's cliched rom-com idea of love, all about dancing in hotel rooms and late night cab rides and leaving town and loving someone either not enough or far too much, each seemingly custom-created to soundtrack the climactic moment or end credits of the tearjerker romantic movies they rip their stories from. But he's an entertaining and earnest festival act, fronting a small band (including members of The Preatures) as he talks about breaking strings and not having enough fun songs to play in this set because all his tunes "are too depressing", and being fully aware that most in the crowd are only there to hear his hit song "Waves", which - he repeatedly and tongue-in-cheek reassures the crowd - is coming at the end of the set. Raw, stripped back acoustic numbers often with just guitar and keys, full of emotion and conviction, he's a charming and endearing performer and a welcome addition to the bill for the final afternoon, as weary punters prepare to rouse themselves for the final few hours of the year.

He's followed by Matt Corby, the former posterboy for Australian folk-pop music who has somewhat disappeared from radars in recent years, reinventing himself again from the long-haired and bearded, wounded guitar minstrel of 'Brother' days to a more upbeat, jazz-y performer who fronts his own band and strolls the stage, microphone in hand. He's a more confident and outgoing performer now, but offers little in the way of crowd interaction, but the thousands gathered don't seem to mind much -- they dance and sing, they jive, as they eagerly wait for the likes of singles 'Knife Edge' and 'Monday' to pop up.

Cut Copy's re-emergence onto the Australian music scene earlier this year was a welcome one, with the electro-rockers having been absent for some time. They're still the fun, upbeat festival act they once were, and in a prominent slot on the festival's closing night, they prove a formidable force, but they're just a warm-up for the night's headliners to take us into 2018. Client Liaison, the kings of retro chic, took to the stage decked in white and surrounded by palm fronds, to bring their high-energy disco tunes to the masses.

It may have seemed an odd choice for New Year act -- an act that looks so unashamedly to the past, ushering thousands of festival-goers into the future -- but it was a treat. Back-up dancers, synchronised dance moves, cannons of confetti and goofy dance bangers which cannot fail to put a smile on even the most cynical of faces, Client Liaison counted down the end of 2017 and heralded the beginning of 2018 with a huge dollop of good old-fashioned, daggy fun.

People come to these festivals for an escape. Its entirely possible, even probable, that NYE in the city will be -- despite the promise and hopes and aspirations about casting off the last year and welcoming in the new one afresh -- one of the worse nights you'll have all year. Entry, drinks, food and transport will be ludicrously expensive, and you'll have to wait in an interminable line just for the privilege of forking over your cash. Here, unless you're a real Scrooge, you'll be guaranteed to have at least a decent time for at least a decent portion of the weekend.

You escape the city, the smog and traffic, and lose yourself in a forest for a weekend, to the soundtrack of cicadas and a bubbling creek and some of your favourite music. Lost Paradise is one of the more beautiful festivals currently on the calendar, and hasn't yet got big enough that it's been ruined by over-exposure to corporate logos and branded tents; still small enough that you can feel cool and 'in the know' by getting tickets. It's fun, silly and beautiful, all at once, and hasn't yet failed to serve up a good time.

It's better than waiting all night for a taxi home.0

Sixteen major climate- and weather-related catastrophes caused a record $306.2 billion in damages and killed at least 362 people in 2017 as the United States suffered its worst wildfire and hurricane seasons in modern history, according to a report released Monday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Hurricanes created the most damage, totaling $265 billion as Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma racked up a respective $125 billion, $90 billion and $50 billion. Wildfires caused $18 billion in losses, tripling previous annual records.

The new tally shattered the previous 2005 record of $215 billion, driven mostly by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall over Houston in late August, is second only to Katrina in for record billion-dollar disasters.

“2017 was a historic year for billion-dollar weather and climate disasters,” Adam Smith, an climatologist at NOAA, said on a call with reporters.

Climate change has made weather events more destructive, with fiercer, more violent storms and prolonged droughts that transformed swaths of the west into tinderboxes, driving up the losses. But part of the problem is that more valuable properties are located on the coasts or near forests. NOAA officials said the analysis did not account for differences between those two factors.-1

Here's What We Think Of ThemIf you talk to any vegan or person who's lactose intolerant, the thing they most likely miss is cheese. Smelly, unique, creamy, delicious cheese.

Similarly, if you chat to any person about veganism, the thing they'll always say (aside from "but bacon") is:

But I just love cheese too much.

Over the past few years, with veganism growing, some pretty awesome food manufactures have committed to making vegan cheese. So much so that if you browse your local health food shop or independent supermarket, you'll find an impressive amount of vegan cheeses -- from Brie and Gouda to classic cheddar and mozzarella.

But are these cheeses any good?

With the help of PETA, The Huffington Post Australia road-tested eight different vegan cheeses. Here's what we thought.

To preface this taste testing experiment, we wanted to make clear that it's important to stay open-minded when it comes to trying new foods, especially vegan alternatives. It's easy to class them all as 'bad' by nature, but this taste test was done with the intention of constructively criticising them.

If people who are vegan or lactose intolerant can find cheese that tastes similar to dairy cheese, that's awesome. Cheese for everyone.

1. Parmesan by Angel Food

This powdered parmesan is vegan, gluten free, egg free and wheat free. Its powder base is made using coconut four, to which salt, yeast extract, vegan flavour for cheesiness and white pepper is added.

You can use this parmesan any way you like -- on pasta, mashed potato, sliced fresh tomatoes or beans on toast.

Here is the vegan Parmesan and ricotta cheese in action.

We tried this powdered Parmesan on spaghetti and this is what we thought:

"Mmm, it's very salty."

"Parmesan cheese is my favourite type of cheese in the world, but not powdered cheese. I still like it, though I can tell the difference."

"It's salty but I would eat it. It smells cheesy, too. It makes me think: are you sure it's not cheese?"

Price: $8.95

2. Tofutti 'Better Than Ricotta Cheese'

The main ingredients in Tofutti's vegan ricotta cheese is tofu and oil, and it can be used on toast, in pies, lasagna, cannelloni and cakes.

We tried vegan ricotta cheese on top of spaghetti. Here's the verdict:

"It doesn't really taste like cheese. It's creamy and almost sweet. It's not cheese but it's definitely not unpleasant."

"I actually really like that. It's creamy and neutral tasting. Interesting."

"It adds a nice creaminess. This would be amazing in spinach and ricotta pie, or on toast with cinnamon and banana."

Price: $8.50

3. MyLife Biocheese 'Cheddar Cheese Slices'

This vegan cheddar cheese is made using water, coconut oil, vegan flavours, salt and b-carotene for that cheddar colour. Like regular cheddar slices, you can use this vegan alternative on burgers, sandwiches and toasties.

Here's what we thought of vegan cheddar cheese on a toastie with tomato.

Uncooked -- "This feels like actual cheese slices."

Toasted -- "It's really cheesy. I can't believe it. It's delicious. I can't tell the difference, I really can't."

"Mmm, it tastes like proper cheddar. It actually tastes and smells like cheese. I thought this was going to be a disaster."

Price: $10.20

These two cheeses had the important melt, ooze and stretchy factors.

4. Daiya 'Mozzarella Style Shreds'

Daiya's vegan alternative to mozzarella is made from tapioca and arrowroot flours, plant oil, pea protein, natural flavours and salt. The cheese is designed to melt, bubble and stretch like regular mozzarella cheese, so it's ideal for pizzas, pastas and lasagna.

We added this mozzarella to some tomato toasties. Here's the verdict:

Uncooked -- "Ooh, this feels a bit weird and rubbery. But it smells like mozzarella."

"It's good, but a bit nutty. It's very creamy and melty -- exactly what you want in a toastie."

"I want to go vegan but I don't want to give up cheese, but this is convincing. I would 100 percent have both of these cheeses [the BioLife cheddar] on a sandwich or toastie."

"It looks a bit weird. It tastes good but it doesn't taste like mozzarella. I mean, I quite like it. It's way saltier than mozzarella."

"I'm so impressed. It's not plastic-y or weird. This is so amazing. It's not even lying when it says that it melts."

Price: $14.80

5. Green Vie 'Gouda Style' vegan cheese

This vegan Gouda cheese is made of water, coconut oil, starch, salt, vegan flavourings and b-carotene for colour. You can melt, slice, grate or cook this neutral tasting dairy free alternative.

We put this cheese in a toastie. Here's what we thought:

"This one smells a bit plastic-y."

"It smells quite like Gouda. It's got a pleasant smell."

"I think the texture is right, but it's not super flavoursome."

"If someone told me this was real Gouda, I would believe them. It's good, but I like the other two [above] better."

"I would never question that it's not cheese. A pleasant surprise."

Price: $6.50

6. Sprout and Kernel 'Herb and Cashew Cheese Nut Cheese'

Sprout and Kernel's vegan cheese is made from cashews, buckwheat, oil, salt and mixed dried herbs and vegetables. This cheese would be great on a platter with crackers to let the zesty blend of herbs and spices speak for itself.

Here's the verdict of the cheese when served on a platter with crackers:

"This is almost like a solid dip. It's herby, peppery, and the base is really creamy. Definitely yummy."

"This one is my favourite. It's not particularly cheesy, but the flavours are so well rounded and delicious."

"I would buy this and the first two cheeses used in the toasties."

"I think the texture is awful. It looks like it would have gelatine in it."

Price: $10.95

No dairy, no worries.

7. Damona Brie

This non-dairy brie is handmade in Melbourne using cultured soy milk, coconut oil, tapioca starch, miso, apple cider vinegar and Himalayan salt.

Like the other cheeses, this vegan Brie was served as a platter with crackers. Here's what we thought:

"It feels like playdough and tastes like nothing."

"It's not offensive but it doesn't taste like anything. Just a cracker with plain mush."

"Nothing like Brie."

"Oh my god, it's got nothing. It's like having a decaffeinated skim almond milk latte. Just have a glass of water."

Price: $11.90

8. Vegusto 'No-Moo Piquant Cheese'

This vegan piquant is made using water, vegetable oils, potato starch, yeast, rice flour, nut butter, rock salt, spice and vegetable flavouring. This style has a strong cheese flavour and is designed to soften when heated and not melt.

We served this cheese on a platter. Here's the verdict:

"This tastes very cheesy. Whoa. It has a slightly unusual aftertaste but it's very similar to regular cheese."

"I like it. It's a bit spicy at the end. This tastes like a cheesy cheese."

"This one's not bad. It's very cheesy."

Price: $11.50

There you have it. Excluding a couple, these cheeses are perfect for all lactose intolerant and vegan people out there who are missing cheese.



You can purchase all these cheeses from The Cruelty Free Shop online or in their store in Glebe, Sydney.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/08/21/this-is-how-long-it-really-takes-to-lose-weight_a_21453914/This Is How Long It Really Takes To Lose WeightYou've just started a new workout routine and eating a more healthy diet (after noticing those jeans have in fact not shrunk, *sigh*), and you're asking this one important question: How long does it take to lose weight?

Is it a few days? Please, be yes. A few weeks? A few months?

To get the answer we all want to know, The Huffington Post Australia spoke to two health experts -- dietitian and sports nutritionist Robbie Clark and trainer Daine McDonald.

"Physiologically speaking, to lose weight you must burn more calories (through physical activity) than you eat or drink," Clark told HuffPost Australia.

"Basic body functions (breathing, nerve function, manufacturing cells, blood circulation and maintaining body temperature) use 50-70 percent of your calories or energy. The rate at which your body uses calories/energy for basic body functions at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR)."

Additional factors that strongly determine your BMR include your genes, age, gender and body composition.

"Therefore, much of your energy use is predetermined," Clark explained. "However, the amount of energy you burn each day also depends on how much exercise you do (intensity, type and duration)."

Once we consume more than our bodies need over a period of time, this then turns into weight gain.

How long it takes to lose weight

While this depends on the individual as every person's body and goals are different to one another, if you begin to exercise three times a week and eat a healthy diet, you may find you lose weight quickly.

"There is no calculation for this as every individual is different and how their body responds to exercise will differ, as well," Clark said.

If an individual is significantly overweight and has more weight to lose than the average person who wants to lose five kilograms, they might lose more weight more quickly, Clark explained. However, this weight loss may be a combination of fluid loss and fat loss.

"For someone who has started exercising three times a week and eating a healthier diet, they may expect to lose one kilogram in 1½-2 weeks," he said. "This is also dependant on the type of exercise they are performing and the duration and intensity of their training."

The rate at which you lose weight depends on your exercise type and duration, as well as lifestyle choices and your overall health.

McDonald agrees, explaining that your 'training age' has a lot to do with how much weight you can lose.

"[Weight loss] really depends on where you are starting at in terms of your base level of physique. By that I mean what is your training age, which is the number of years you have trained for," McDonald told HuffPost Australia.

"An example might be if you had not trained in years and put on 20 kilograms of weight, in particular around the midsection. Once you got into a routine of training, say four times per week and living by the 80/20 rule with your nutrition (80 percent good food and 20 percent bad), no doubt you would see a noticeable shift by the end of the first fortnight by potentially a few kilograms."

For someone who is new to training and doing 3-4 sessions per week while eating correctly, you can expect to lose anywhere between 0.5-2kg per week, depending on just how much weight they need to lose.

However, if you had been already training three times per week and eating well, and decided to ramp it up to 5-6 exercise sessions per week and refine your food, then you may find a much smaller amount of results.

"There is no magic formula when it comes to predicting weight or fat loss," McDonald said. "In saying that, from experience, for someone who is new to training and doing 3-4 sessions per week while eating correctly, you can expect to lose anywhere between 0.5-2 kilograms per week, depending on just how much weight they need to lose.

"The main things to remember are that, if you are serious about results, you want to train four times per week ideally and follow the 80/20 rule above. This alone should make a different to your body composition and overall health."

Why it's harder to lose weight than to gain it

As we all know, it's much easier to gain weight than it is to lose it. While this is primarily due to habit (if we're used to eating cake every day, it's ridiculously hard to stop), according to Clark and McDonald, there are a few other reasons why it can be difficult to shift weight.

Lifestyle choices

"I think it's important to note that the biology of weight loss and weight maintenance is a complex process," Clark explained. "There are so many factors that contribute to overweight and obesity such as diet, inactivity, genetics, smoking, motivation, alcohol consumption, stress, poor sleep hygiene, occupation, environment and hormone imbalance, to name a few."

We can't underestimate the power of sleep for our mental and physical health.

Underlying health issues

"If you are struggling to lose weight, it's important to rule out any underlying causes first and foremost," Clark said. "There could be a medical reason for your struggle such as a chronic health condition like cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes, or a hormone imbalance such as your thyroid, sex hormones, insulin or cortisol."

Stress

"In today's world I believe the biggest factor that influences weight gain is stress, both physiological and psychological," McDonald told HuffPost Australia.

"When your stress hormones such as cortisol are elevated in your body for prolonged periods of time it limits your body's ability to burn body fat, so when you factor in work stress, family stress, training stress, financial stress and so on, people end up being in an overly stressed and exhausted state.

"Over time this can lead to a large build up of visceral fat, which can be hard to shake."

Mindfulness or meditation can do wonder for stress levels (and you don't need to go to a fancy retreat do practise).

Dieting and ageing

Although dieting can be a tempting method of quickly losing weight, Clark said the negative effects of dieting far outweigh the positive.

"Other factors that contribute to difficulties losing weight include regular yo-yo dieting, mindless eating, sedentary lifestyle and slowing metabolism that comes with age," Clark said.

"These factors predominately influence your hormone function, which plays a major role in your body's ability to lose weight.

"For example, weight cycling or yo-yo dieting can change your physiology. A reason for this is that through constant dieting your hunger hormone (ghrelin) increases and your fullness hormone (leptin) decreases. As a result, you will feel hungrier and less satiated every time you eat."

Fill up on these goodies instead of restricting.

How to lose weight in a healthy, sustainable way

In order to lose weight safely and in a way that you will actually be able to follow for more than a week, Clark and McDonald recommend the following.

1. Be realistic with your weight loss goals

"A guide to follow for safe and sustainable weight loss is to aim for 0.5–1 kilogram per week. In order to lose one kilogram per week, you would need to burn and reduce your dietary intake by approximately 1,000 calories per day," Clark said.

If you're thinking 1,000 calories per day is completely unachievable, it equates to a one hour HIIT session (around 800 calories) and eating one less snack (around 200 calories).

"Having said this, it is also important that you create as much food variety as possible so you don't put yourself at risk of malnutrition or nutrient deficiencies."

2. Avoid dieting and skipping meals

Not only is skipping meals bad for your mood, energy levels and overall health, but it can also affect the way you eat later on.

"If you do skip meals, you are more likely to eat more when you do eat, and this may lead to a larger stomach capacity," Clark said.

"Crash dieting is a short term solution that will increase your body fat levels in the long term due to your body lowering its metabolic rate as a result."

Getting up and moving is addictive once you get into the rhythm and routine.

3. Exercise regularly

"Train four times per week for 45-60 minutes per workout," McDonald said. "While three times per week is good, four times per week is much better."

For best results, Clark recommends doing a combination of resistance (weight) training and cardiovascular training.

"Think of strength training as the main course at a restaurant -- cardio and yoga are all the equivalent of an entrée. So strength training is the foundation of health and fitness," McDonald added.

"To stay in shape you need to teach your body to be healthy -- by being consistent with your training and nutrition week in and week out."

4. Cut down on the refined carbs

"Refined carbohydrates such as cake, biscuits, cookies, muffins, chips, cupcakes, soft drink, fruit juice and most supermarket breads will make you store fat if not burned off," Clark explained.

5. Watch your portions

"Be cautious of portion size of main meals and snacks -- always eat to 80 percent full before returning for seconds," Clark said.

6. Avoid drinking your calories

"Don't drink your calories -- avoid beverages that contain 'empty' calories and don't fill you up such as soft drinks, large fruit juices and energy drinks," Clark said.

7. It's never too late to start (or to try again)

"Health is in the mind, so remember you are never too late to start and it is never too late to rekindle your passion for health and fitness," McDonald said.

“Game of Thrones” star Maisie Williams — a.k.a. Arya Stark in HBO’s epic fantasy drama ― appears to have inadvertently revealed when the show will return to television screens for its eighth and final season.

“We wrap in December and we air our first episode in April (2019),” she said in an interview that British newspaper Metro shared online Wednesday.

HBO had already confirmed the show would conclude in 2019, but had not offered up details of exactly when. HBO did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for confirmation.0

Raisman tweeted her statement to the USOC in response to their letter to USAG on Thursday, in which they called for the entire board of directors to resign or else the sport’s governing body would lose their certification.

On Friday, USAG said it would comply with the USOC’s request to have all members of the board’s remaining 18 members resign. USAG chairman Paul Parilla, vice chairman Jay Binder and treasurer Bitsy Kelley resigned Monday.

In the Thursday letter, USOC CEO Scott Blackmun gave the USAG a list of steps it must take to reform the organization, including electing an interim board by the end of next month and cooperating in an independent investigation.

Raisman, however, believes that the investigation should be completed ― and all the people who enabled Larry Nassar’s abuse ousted ― before new members are elected to the board.

“I feel very strongly that unless and until an independent investigation is competed, we cannot be sure (1) we know the full extent of the problem, (2) that all the people who contributed to the problem have been removed and replaced, and (3) that the changes will effectively address the problem,” Raisman said in the statement.

The gymnast insisted that Nassar had more victims who haven’t yet spoken out and said that it was necessary to uncover any USAG staff or board members who may have “fostered” Nassar’s actions.

“What possible reason could there be for not making it a priority to know these things,” Raisman asked. “If we don’t investigate, it’s possible an individual who enabled Nassar could be appointed to the board OR the board could have the difficult task of overseeing staff that enabled Nassar.”

Raisman offered the USOC her own set of requirements, asking Blackmun to ensure the investigation operates “with complete independence” and requesting that the investigation’s findings be made public at the same time it’s delivered to the USOC and USAG.

Raisman, who was one of more than a hundred women who were molested by Nassar, has become one of the most vocal proponents to demand public accountability from the individuals and organizations who enabled Nassar’s rampant abuse.

During an interview with the “Today” show on Thursday, Raisman criticized USAG and the USOC for prioritizing winning over athletes’ safety.

Nassar “did not have a medical license in Texas, which is where we went to the ranch and trained,” Raisman said on the show. “It’s a national team training center and the Olympic training center ... so what does that say about USA Gymnastics and United States Olympic Committee? Whether they knew or didn’t know, that’s a big problem and we need to investigate how this happened.”-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/12/whipped-beaten-and-abused-why-nobody-could-help-young-tennis-star-jelena-dokic_a_23274909/Whipped, Beaten And Abused, Why Nobody Could Help Young Tennis Star Jelena DokicThe biography of Jelena Dokic, entitled "Unbreakable", has just hit the shelves and it contains some awful details of the physical and verbal abuse the former Australian tennis star suffered at the hands of her father, Damir.

The physical abuse was so brutal that Jelena once lost consciousness at the hands of her father. She spoke of a belt that cut like a knife, and of being thrown around the room. The verbal abuse was so sickening, Damir would call his daughter words like "slut" and "whore" when she was just 11.

Amid all this, the focus has turned to what authorities could -- or legally, should -- have done.

There's no looking back now for Dokic.

Under Australia's mandatory reporting laws, selected groups of people are legally obliged to report suspected cases of child abuse and neglect to government authorities.

Tennis Australia said it did this. It released a statement on Sunday, which in part read:

"All of us at Tennis Australia applaud Jelena's courage in telling her story and will continue to support her in any way we can. There were many in tennis at the time who were concerned for Jelena's welfare, and many who tried to assist with what was a difficult family situation. Some officials even went as far as lodging police complaints, which without co-operation from those directly involved, unfortunately could not be fully investigated."

So tennis authorities are effectively saying "we reported, but the matter went no further".

But why not? Why did the reports go no further? HuffPost Australia put that question to Professor Kerryann Walsh of the Queensland University of Technology. She explained that the reports should have gone to child protection authorities, not police.

"Police can also receive reports of abuse against a child, but they are looking for severe physical evidence and witnesses. People would have had to make statements and Damir may not have cooperated.

"However if abuse is reported to child protection authorities, the kind of investigation they do has a different kind of threshold. What they're trying to establish is whether the child has suffered harm, and whether they are at risk of harm now and in future. "

Walsh said she was not intimately familiar with the details of Jelena Dokic's case, but did say it was doubtful that there would have been a class of person who was directly responsible for reporting her situation.

"[The onus to report] is usually restricted to professionals who spend most of their time working with children," Walsh explained.

In most cases, that means people like teachers or psychologists. It's a bit of a grey area as to whether other tennis people fitted into that formal responsibility. Another complication is that Tennis Australia is a national body, and mandatory reporting laws are state laws.

The Dokics in the early 2000s. Dad not happy, just for a change.

A key question remains: could anyone have helped the young Jelena Dokic, who is now 34?

Kerryann Walsh said that while under the law, only certain people are required to report abuse, any member of the public is empowered to. In other words, if you see it, you can report it, no matter who you are.

Walsh told us about about the so-called "bystander effect", where people are reluctant to get involved.

"We all saw that happening to Jelena. Despite there being legislation, people don't take action because they don't think it's their place.

"It gets even more grey with a girl who is 16 or 17. Legally she is a child but she is able to consent for herself in all other respects. People are uncomfortable with even thinking about that as child maltreatment."

One man who touched very strongly on the bystander effect was ABC Sports writer Richard Hinds -- who covered Dokic at the peak of her career which included a semi-final appearance at Wimbledon in 2000 when she was just 16. Hinds ended his emotive piece arguing "we should have done more".

By "we", he appeared to be referring to media, tennis authorities and anyone close enough to see what was going on. Tennis Australia did as it was legally required, but was that enough?-1
http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/09/8-of-the-best-pulled-jackfruit-recipes_a_23271402/8 Of The Best Pulled Jackfruit RecipesOf all the vegan meat alternatives, pulled jackfruit is definitely the most surprising. A massive spiky fruit turned into flavoursome pulled 'pork'? You betcha.

The reason why jackfruit works is due to its fibrous and meaty texture. Although you can eat jackfruit on its own and in desserts, when it's cooked in sauce the jackfruit meat becomes tender and juicy, soaking up all the flavours and spices. And then, just like you would pork, you can shred the cooked jackfruit until you have vegan pulled 'pork'.

Once you've got your seriously convincing pulled jackfruit, you can use it anywhere you would pork -- from tacos and burritos to burgers and pizza. It's super cool, not to mention delicious.

If you're ready to try pulled jackfruit, head to your nearest Asian supermarket, grab a few cans of young jackfruit in water or brine, and try one (or all) of these eight delicious recipes.
