http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/women-what-does-this-budget-mean-for-you_uk_5a1610e2e4b068a3ca6df62aWomen - What Does This Budget Mean For You?-5The budget has arrived delivering little more than a tinkering round the edges and as per usual next to nothing for women. The issue here is that the budget is shaped around a very narrow notion of the economy, namely the notion that what counts is the GDP, jobs and productivity. This approach overlooks activities that sustain our economic growth, our social reproduction and does not take measure of our NNP, our net National Product – a calculation that might better show the economic wellbeing of ordinary citizens.

These budgets are set under a paradigm that sees men as the main earners in society and seeks to make policies that win voter approval on this basis. In this paradigm policies are geared towards the growth in traditionally male dominated spheres. Heavy industries and infrastructure projects which lead to employment of men – such as rail building, are favoured over investment in social infrastructure where more women are employed – Health, Education and Care for example. Surprising though it might be that the Conservatives will be working with the TUC on their newly announced construction skills programme this will on the whole lead to skills and work for men rather than women. And again while Hammond spoke of white van men AND women driving their diesel vans with impunity, exempt from the new charges on polluting vehicles, lets face it very few of those van drivers are women. Gender neutrality here hides the fact that this is an exemption for men.

In education funding has been set aside to encourage children to study maths and computer science. While this funding is welcome, it has to be noted that these are subjects where there is a huge gender imbalance, which the UK has done nothing to address: currently 60 % of Math A levels are taken by boys and 40% by girls and a mere 10% of Computer Science A levels are taken by girls. This is gender imbalance is not seen in other countries. And while schools will be competing to win this funding and become specialist maths schools this policy does nothing to address the future cuts schools are facing. This specialist maths school funding amounts to a plug for amount already lost for a select few while the rest of our schools are still set to contend with losses of up to -15% per year.

While action is being taken to encourage house building - £44 billion of capital funding loans- we can’t be sure what percentage of these new houses will be so called ‘affordable’ homes, affordable homes that are not affordable for most people. What we need, what women disproportionately need is social housing. However this government is focused on first time buyers and helping them get on the housing ladder by abolishing stamp duty, this will not help the most vulnerable in our society.

The impacts of the budget on women are striking for what was not mentioned. No mention for example of the gap in social care or women’s frontline services. Cuts already made to these sectors will continue to impact women to their detriment. Cuts to the public service sector, the continued underfunding of the NHS, areas where women are both a higher proportion of employees and users of these services have not been redressed. Indeed it will be women who will pick up the unpaid care work for those who have been failed by both our NHS and our depleted social care system. And while paltry sums of money will be dished out here and there, none of the policies announced today come anywhere close to addressing the damage done by previous budgets.http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/government-brexit-deadline-is-not-so-much-a-red-herring-as-a-dead-cat_uk_5a157910e4b0f401dfa7ec28Government Brexit Deadline Is Not So Much A Red Herring As A Dead Cat-1I have a prediction about the government amendment to EU Withdrawal Bill, fixing the time the UK leaves the EU as “before, after or at 11pm on 29th March 2019”. It will be withdrawn by government on the evening it is debated, having served its purpose of putting up a massive target for Remain-leaning MPs and newspapers to get hugely upset about, and for Leave-leaning MPs to say “look at that, don’t look at this other stuff”.

It’s the biggest dead cat strategy employed by the Brexit brigade since the days of the Referendum.

As we know, the EU Withdrawal bill gives the government rights to massively trample over Parliament in the name of Parliamentary Sovereignty. Ministers, with a little help from a Gerrymandered Select Committee makeup, can do almost whatever they like.

Naturally for such a hugely important bill, many amendments have been put forward, to protect EU citizens (including us), to protect the environment, animal welfare, and most importantly, to protect our country from predatory use of the bill itself. But by far the biggest attention-grabber has been the amendment to Clause 14 (The Time We Will Leave Amendment).

The Withdrawal Bill has generated 191 pages of amendments containing 378 changes and 75 new clauses. Parliament has allocated eight 8-hour sessions of debate time for these amendments – that’s a little under 9 minutes of debate per change, not counting the time to actually vote on them. In practice this is managed by a process whereby the Speaker’s office and representatives from both sides group amendments into related packages, to stop us debating changes until way past March 2019.

Despite this cripplingly tight deadline to sort out the amendments, hours of debate time on the first day were wasted on Frank Field’s daft amendment for the actual time we leave the EU to be set using GMT rather than EU time. This amendment was eventually withdrawn after doing its job of occupying enough Parliamentary energy.

Three days of the eight allocated have now passed with zero amendments being passed. Every amendment has been voted down. And some of them are very important.

One amendment recently defeated was to include EU rules about animal sentience into UK law – this defeat means that the official government line post-Brexit is essentially that animals can feel no pain, and don’t care how badly you treat them.

Two more crucial amendments were overturned in more recent debates – Challenges to Validity of Retained EU Law (which sounds dull but defeat means the UK can mess with employment rights after Brexit and those affected can’t go to the ECJ) – and most scarily the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which are a package of human rights which UK citizens obviously currently benefit from.

These three amendments collectively mean we probably won’t be able to export meat to the EU as we won’t abide by their animal welfare standards, that any EU national still crazy enough to wish to work here after Brexit wouldn’t have the same employment rights, and that UK citizens could lose fundamental human rights (this last amendment wasn’t defeated but withdrawn after government promised a “full report”, which supposedly is good enough).

Another Labour amendment suggested we may want to stay in zero-tariff trading arrangements with the EU – meaning we could essentially stay in the Single Market / Customs Union. This was heavily defeated, with the astounding spectacle of Labour shadow cabinet members walking through the Lobby alongside David Davis, and Labour’s Barry Gardiner suggesting it was “illiterate” and illogical, without suggesting a more literate or logical alternative that could allow the UK to retain the huge benefits of the Single Market. Some of us remember when leaving the Single Market / Customs Union was described as a “Disastrous Hard Brexit” by Labour benches, and also remember how Theresa May went to the country to give her a mandate for a her version of Brexit – and lost her majority because of it. Now it’s a policy that Labour defends, making Theresa’s dalliance with the Ballot Box even more of a waste of time.

Hundreds of amendments are being defeated, with Remain-leaning Tories being advised to choose their battles in favour of defeating the Exit Date amendment, which is meaningless for two reasons. Firstly, a legal time limit already exists on when we leave the EU – exactly 2 years after we triggered Article 50 (i.e. on 29th March 2019) and short of withdrawing Article 50 there’s nothing we can do about it. That date cannot be changed by us unilaterally, only by agreement with the rest of the EU it. We can legally withdraw Article 50 unilaterally, as one of the authors who drafted it points out, but not fiddle with the date.

Secondly, the Henry VIII powers given to ministers in the Bill “where necessary to aid the process of withdrawal” allows them to alter the bill itself so any clause can essentially be changed or ditched. Ministers could push the date in either direction at will. These powers are in clauses yet to be debated, and the Lords is likely to kick up a huge fuss about them, but as it stands we must trust David Davis and Boris Johnson not to abuse their powers. As if they would…

Government has introduced a Big Scary though meaningless amendment as a distraction from the real changes that should be made. Expect them to drop it on the day it’s debated, with great fanfare about “defeat on a crucial aspect of Brexit” by both sides, when the damage has already been done.http://cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/conyers-lawyer-allegations/index.htmlLawyer: Conyers won't resign House seat, did not harass women-7(CNN) An attorney for embattled Rep. John Conyers told CNN on Wednesday that the Michigan Democrat will not resign as he faces an investigation by the House Ethics Committee over allegations that he sexually harassed and discriminated against members of his staff.

In a phone conversation with a CNN reporter, attorney Arnold Reed said Conyers was taking the allegations "very seriously" but did not plan to resign his House seat.

"Mr. Conyers is not going to resign," Reed said. "If everybody that was facing 'allegations' -- including the President, members of the House and Senate -- resigned, we'd have a lot of unemployed people walking around."

Reed added that Conyers was not taking the allegations lightly but that he is innocent of all wrongdoing.

"At the end of the day, Mr. Conyers is not guilty of harassing these women who have come forward. It didn't happen," he said.

With new faces and old favorites in the lineup, the Americana extravaganza made its way through 2 ½ miles of Manhattan on a cold morning.

"The crowds are still the same, but there's a lot more police here. That's the age we live in," Paul Seyforth said as he attended the parade he'd watched since the 1950s.

"Not a lot's changed — the balloons, the bands, the floats — and that's the good thing," said Seyforth, 76, who'd flown in from Denver to spend his 50th wedding anniversary in New York and see this year's parade.

The televised parade was proceeding smoothly, though about midway through, a gust of wind on a largely calm day blew a candy-cane balloon into a tree branch, and it popped near the start of the route on Manhattan's Upper West Side. No one was injured.

In 2005, one of the parade's signature giant balloons caught a gust, hit a Times Square lamppost and injured two people. The candy cane was smaller than the giant balloons.

NYPD TO USE SECRET WEAPON AT THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE: 'VAPOR WAKE' RETRIEVERS

Timothy McMillian and his wife, their 9-year-old daughter and his in-laws started staking out a spot along the route at 6:30 a.m. They'd come from Greensboro, North Carolina, to see in person the spectacle they'd watched on TV for years.

McMillian, a 45-year-old schoolteacher, booked a hotel months ago, but he started to have some concerns about security when a truck attack on a bike path near the World Trade Center killed eight people on Halloween.

"With the event being out in the open like this, we were concerned," he said. "But we knew security would be ramped up today, and we have full confidence in the NYPD."

Authorities say there is no confirmation of a credible threat to the parade, but they were taking no chances after both the truck attack and the October shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival.

New York Police Department officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors were circulating among the crowds, sharpshooters were on rooftops and sand-filled city sanitation trucks were poised as imposing barriers to traffic at every cross street. Officers also were escorting each of the giant balloons.

The mayor and police brass have repeatedly stressed that visitors shouldn't be deterred. And Bekki Grinnell certainly wasn't.

"When your kid from Alaska is marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, you come," said Grinnell, whose daughter was marching with the band from Colony High School in Palmer, Alaska. Grinnell said she wasn't worried about security because of the police presence: "I think we're in a safe spot."

Other paradegoers also showed their appreciation for police: The NYPD marching band and a group of mounted officers got some of the biggest cheers from spectators lined up as many as 15 deep along barricades. Among other crowd favorites: as did the SpongeBob SquarePants balloon.

The 91st annual parade featured new balloons including Olaf from the Disney movie "Frozen" and Chase from the TV cartoon "Paw Patrol" will be among the new balloons Thursday, along with a new version of the Grinch of Dr. Seuss fame.

Smokey Robinson, The Roots, Flo Rida and Wyclef Jean were among the stars celebrating, along with performances from the casts of Broadway's "Anastasia," ''Dear Evan Hansen" and "SpongeBob SquarePants." The lineup included a dozen marching bands, as well as the high-kicking Radio City Music Hall Rockettes — and, of course, Santa Claus.

"This is my favorite thing ever," musician Questlove told The Associated Press as he got ready to ride the Gibson Guitars float with his bandmates in The Roots and late-night host Jimmy Fallon of "The Tonight Show," where The Roots are the house band. Questlove said being in the parade is "probably my favorite perk" of the job.

"To go from being a spectator to being up here, it's kinda cool," he said.

Added singer-songwriter Andy Grammer as he got on the Homewood Suites float: "It's kind of like being at the center of Thanksgiving."https://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/95878885/list/up-to-80-off-kitchen-bestsellersUp to 80% Off Kitchen Bestsellers1ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS

Because the bathroom is small, options for a new claw-foot tub were limited. Rather than pay for a new cast-iron tub, the homeowners decided to repurpose the existing claw-foot tub.They did not choose this shade for the bathtub randomly; it appears as an accent color in the kitchen nearby. Young thought painting the tub this color would created cohesion between the two rooms. After deciding on the exterior color, it was time to choose a new faucet and tub filler.“This is when the project took a turn,” Young says.The plumbing holes for the previous bathtub plumbing fixtures were spaced close together, making it impossible to just go out and buy a new set off the shelf. They had two options: Have the faucet and tub filler custom-made, or refinish the inside of the tub. They chose the latter option because the tub was being taken out of the house to be painted on the outside anyway.This proved to be a great decision. The bathtub looked brand new without being as expensive as a new one, and Young could now install any fixtures the homeowners chose — well, almost any.The homeowners loved the matte black finish on the Brizo tub filler and coordinating sink faucet, but at the time of the project, they could only get the matte black sink faucet with SmartTouch Technology. The price for this touch-to-turn-on feature was higher, but the homeowners were willing to pay the additional amount to get the matching matte black finish they loved. The feature requires a battery pack, which forced the team to find a vanity that could discreetly hide it.https://www.houzz.com/photo/1842578-sagamore-house-southwestern-exterior-los-angelesby martha picciotti0People who liked this photo also likedhttps://www.houzz.com/product/34873663-axis-3-light-pendant-winter-gold-transitional-pendant-lightingCapital Lighting 4233RS Axis 3-Light Pendant, Russet0Thank you for your review!

Minutes from the Fed's November 1 meeting show that doubts exist among policymakers about whether low inflation is, in fact, transitory.

Wall Street is still counting on a December interest-rate hike, but future rate increases may be in doubt unless inflation and wages pick up.



Between Janet Yellen's speech on Tuesday night and the minutes of the Federal Reserve's November meeting, one message is becoming increasingly clear: Officials are becoming uncomfortable with their forecasts of a "transitory" period of inflation below the central bank's target.

It means interest rates may not climb the way many on Wall Street expect.

As Yellen prepares to cede the helm of the central bank to her colleague Jerome Powell early next year, these concerns cast doubt over the Fed's forecasts of several additional interest-rate increases in 2018 and 2019.

"I will say I am very uncertain about this," Yellen said in remarks on Tuesday evening. "My colleagues and I are not certain that it is transitory, and we are monitoring inflation very closely."

Traders think the Fed's meeting on December 12 and 13 is too soon for a change of course, and markets have long priced in an additional interest-rate hike then. The Fed has raised interest rates four times in halting steps since December 2015, to a range of 1% to 1.25%, after having left them at essentially zero for seven years in response to the Great Recession.

Still, further hikes are far from certain. Minutes from the central bank's latest policy meeting reaffirmed Yellen's tone and suggested that others on the committee share her views:

"Many participants observed, however, that continued low readings on inflation, which had occurred even as the labor market tightened, might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent."

Financial markets are on tenterhooks waiting for Powell, who has much less experience than Yellen in monetary policy and economics and has said little about interest rates, to speak on the record.

Yellen and her colleagues have previously expressed surprise at an inflation rate that has continued to undershoot the Fed's official 2% target for much of the economic recovery — a trend that suggests the labor market is not fully healed despite a historically low 4.1% jobless rate.

Another sign of trouble: Wages are not rising for most Americans, leading to a loss of purchasing power despite low reported inflation readings.

Unless both wages and inflation begin to pick up soon, Fed officials under any leadership should reconsider their gusto to tighten financial conditions in a still fragile economy.http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-judge-orders-uber-customer-to-arbitrate-price-fixing-claims-2017-11U.S. judge orders Uber customer to arbitrate price-fixing claims-3By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled that Uber can force an unhappy Connecticut customer's price-fixing case against the ride-service company into arbitration, after the customer said the proposed class action belonged in court because he never agreed to arbitrate.

In an order dated Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan also dismissed claims by the customer, Spencer Meyer, against former Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, unless Meyer wishes to arbitrate.

Rakoff, long a critic of mandatory arbitration, said he would explain his reasoning later. Reuters obtained a copy of his order, which was not available in online court records.

"We are pleased with the court's decision," Uber said in an email.

Lawyers for Meyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Kalanick's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

Arbitration clauses are often buried in lengthy terms of service that customers never see or would struggle to read.

Critics say the clauses, which often forbid class actions, dissuade many people from pursuing claims at all.

Meyer had accused San Francisco-based Uber and Kalanick of conspiring with drivers, whose earnings are shared with Uber, to charge "surge pricing" fares during peak demand periods.

He said he never agreed to arbitrate because a keypad had obscured a hyperlink to Uber's terms of service, including the arbitration clause, when he signed up with his smartphone.

Uber countered that Meyer had an unobstructed view of the hyperlink, and waived the keypad issue because he could have raised it sooner. The lawsuit began in December 2015.

Kalanick said claims against him must be dismissed because he was no longer Uber's chief executive. He resigned in June after a shareholder revolt.

On Aug. 17, the federal appeals court in Manhattan had reinstated the arbitration provision, overturning a July 2016 ruling by Rakoff that found it unenforceable.

Later that month, the appeals court said Rakoff may consider new evidence about how long Uber customers could see the hyperlink, including when entering credit card information.

Internet companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have argued during the litigation that a loss by Uber could inhibit e-commerce and threaten the enforceability of online contracts.

The case is Meyer v. Kalanick et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-09796.

llana Weinstein, founder of the The IDW Group, is a tour de force within the hedge-fund industry.

She recruits top-level talent for the world’s most prestigious investment firms including hedge funds, family offices and private equity funds.

Weinstein recently sat down with Business Insider’s hedge fund reporter Rachael Levy for a wide-ranging interview about the industry. She says your college major isn’t actually that important when it comes to landing a dream hedge fund job after graduation. Instead, it all comes down to passion. Here’s more from the interview:

Rachael Levy: What advice would you give to a young person coming out of school who wants to join a hedge fund? What kind of educational background are funds looking for now?

Ilana Weinstein: Focus on what lights you up – not the dollar signs. There are thousands of hedge funds and most won’t make it.

There are thousands of hedge funds and most won’t make it. It’s kind of like the dot-com bubble when I was coming out of school. Unless you live and breathe investing and everything that goes on in your area of interest, this is not for you. What I am most inspired by is passion. This manifests itself through someone who is on fire about what is evolving in his industry, sector, how committed he is. I know it when I see it.

I wouldn’t worry much about majors. School is a time to expand your horizons and learn how to think. That skill set and flexibility will serve you better as an investor than any individual class. I have had a few Founders disparage the value of an MBA. They would rather the person spent those two years in an investing seat going through different markets. As an MBA myself I am mixed on that but I understand the point.

Here's a quick breakdown2If you're keeping up to date on technology news, you're probably seeing references to machine learning everywhere, and for good reason: machine learning is an integral component of the way that computers process information. Machine learning is all around us, informing our day to day lives from the way we navigate Google maps right down to the way we check our inboxes. But what is it exactly, and when did it start being such a big deal? Here's a quick explainer to get you up to date: View As: One Page Slides

There have been two especially important developments in the history of machine learning: the first began with artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel, who coined the term "machine learning" back in 1959. In 1959, MIT engineer Arthur Samuel described machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Samuel was busy creating his own computing machine: an autonomous checker program that he envisioned would someday beat the top world checker player champion.

The other important development in machine learning? The internet. The advent of the internet presented a trove of accumulated data. With so much information readily available, there seemed but one thing to do: figure out a way to organize it into meaningful patterns — one of machine learning's most integral roles.

Big data is the fundamental building block of machine learning. Big data, is, essentially, exactly what it's called: a ton of data. It's all of the information accrued by social media companies, search engines, and even microphones and cameras that are constantly collecting information.

Algorithms sort through this vast collection of information so that technology can predict what we'll do next. Vast amounts of data inform machine learning algorithms, equipping technology with methods of predicting future patterns. These algorithms provide a way to forecast future behavior and anticipate forthcoming problems. One of the best-known examples of this is Amazon's suggested product feature. It reads your preferences and the buying habits of other people, and then recommends other products you might be interested in.

Machine learning is all about sorting through those troves of collected information to discern patterns and predict new ones. Machine learning differs from human learning, insofar as the machine only knows what you tell it: A computer can't express curiosity or make inferences. For example, if you watch a lot of scifi movies on Netflix, you might find Stranger Things in your suggestion queue. But it's only a matter of math, based on Netflix's data alone — if you've never told Netflix that you love documentaries, or rated one highly, the system will likely never show you one.

But current day iterations of machine learning have radically evolved since the 1600s. Today, machines can learn with only minimal human intervention. Through machine learning, technologists have mimicked the way the human brain works by producing sophisticated systems called neural networks. In turn, neural networks enable deep learning, an outcome that has produced computer systems superseding human intelligence.

Machine learning plays a key role in the development of artificial intelligence. A.I. and machine learning are often conflated, but they're not the same thing. Artificial intelligence refers to a machine's ability to perform intelligent tasks, whereas machine learning refers to the automated process by which machines weed out meaningful patterns in data. Without machine learning, artificial intelligence as we know it wouldn't be possible.http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-issued-dark-mifid-warning-wall-street-analysts-2017-11The head of JPMorgan’s nearly $2 trillion funds business issued a stark warning for a large group of Wall Streeters-6Mary Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan Chase's $1.9 trillion asset and wealth management business, painted a bleak future for many Wall Street stock analysts at a conference Thursday.

Asset managers like JPMorgan are expected to slash research budgets by as much as 50% in response to European regulatory reform known as MiFID II.

That means money to pay analysts will shrink, leaving only top-tier talent with a higher standard of excellence.

"I was dealing with 10 of you; I don't want 10 of you anymore, I only want the five best of you," Erdoes said.

Wall Street stock analysts are about to find themselves on the chopping block, and only the best will survive.

That was the hard truth Mary Erdoes had for a room full of analysts Thursday at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference.

Erdoes, the head of JPMorgan Chase's $1.9 trillion asset and wealth management business, was asked about impacts from MiFID II — Europe's sweeping financial regulatory changes that will be implemented in 2018 — and painted a future in which asset mangers chop their budgets and only pay for research from top-tier analysts.

"On the buy side, the larger firms will absorb the costs and figure out how that cascades its way through," Erdoes said. "It probably means they'll tighten up a lot on what they spend on sell-side research, which is why the two go hand in hand."

Firms are planning to make cuts because MiFID II requires asset managers pay for research separately from commissions for trading execution, whereas it previously often came bundled with other products.

Most of the largest asset managers, including JPMorgan, are absorbing the multi-million dollar costs and funding the research internally, rather than passing the costs on to their customers.

"I only want the five best of you."

This is bad news for stock analysts, as it could result in a 50% "compression" in research budgets, according to Credit Suisse. That means less money to go around.

Erdoes plainly laid out what happens next: "I was dealing with 10 of you; I don't want 10 of you anymore, I only want the five best of you."

She noted that the sell-side research industry had already contracted massively in recent years, with investment banks spending "50% of what they used to spend."

"So you're the precious few. The rest of them are not here. Maybe this room was five-times bigger before, I don't know," Erdoes told the audience of analysts, many of whom would presumably not be there the following year given the looming cuts.

The upside? The research quality will improve as the fat is trimmed.

"It'll just make the industry better," Erdoes said. "It will constantly get you to excellence and get rid of the less than excellence."

That's the cold hard truth sell-side stock analysts are facing: If you're not in the top-tier, the Mary Erdoes's of the world won't have much use for you anymore.

Some who get edged out, however, will likely find work within buy-side asset managers, she added.

Erdoes also anticipates the number of sell-side research providers will shrink, as the smaller firms will have to price competitively with the larger firms while still paying for top talent.

"It's going to be very difficult for the the bespoke, research-driven firms to be able to do that on the sell side," Erdoes said.http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-rival-lyft-raises-another-500-million-for-115-billion-valuation-2017-11Lyft just raised another $500 million— now it's valued at $11.5 billion3Uber rival Lyft is raising an additional $500 million in funding, according to a U.S. share authorization document filed in Delaware. Axios was first to report the news.

The additional funding round, led by Alphabet’s CapitalG, is an extension of the $1 billion round announced in October.

Lyft spokesman Adrian Durbin, confirming the funding round, in an e-mailed statement said, “Increasing the potential for this round will allow us to further accelerate our commitment to serving passengers and drivers.”

In October Lyft had said that the previous round of funding boosted its valuation to $11 billion from $7.5 billion. The fresh funding would raise its valuation to $11.5 billion.http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-coo-david-solomon-has-a-side-hobby-as-an-edm-dj-2017-10A 55-year-old Goldman Sachs exec started spinning EDM shows, and he said it's helped his career on Wall Street3More often than not, you're likely to find David Solomon at Goldman Sachs' headquarters in Tribeca, helping run the most prestigious white-collar investment bank on Wall Street, where the COO has been a partner since 1999.

But you might also spy him at The Whales, an Asian-fusion night spot on New York's bustling Lower East Side, donning a T-shirt and a white pair of headphones.

Or, Beautique in Midtown — dubbed a "millionaire playpen" by the New York Post.

But Solomon isn't so much playing with fellow millionaires as he is playing for them — and countless others as well.

The investment banking stalwart has of late been moonlighting as a DJ on the Electronic Dance Music scene, sharing the stage with stars like Paul Oakenfold and, last month, even spinning vinyl at Willow Studios in Los Angeles for the Electronic Music Awards.

Great to get some time on the decks at #theEMAwards. A post shared by DJ D-Sol (@dj_d_sol) on Sep 23, 2017 at 8:32am PDT on Sep 23, 2017 at 8:32am PDT

It's an unorthodox hobby for a high-powered finance exec, a breed that more commonly spends its free time hitting the golf links, curating art, cavorting at charity galas, or jetting off to tony weekend homes in the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard.

But Solomon has been an audiophile his whole life, as he recently explained in an episode of the podcast "Exchanges at Goldman Sachs."

"I always loved music," Solomon said. "I was a very analog guy, when I was in college, I must have had over 1,000 LPs, vinyl albums."

A lot has changed since Solomon's college days in the early 1980s. The digitization of music over the past 15 years has facilitated easy access to artists and genres that might previously have remained muted or cordoned off to outsiders.

"I think this year I just saw a statistic that 63 percent of all music is being consumed in a streaming form now," Solomon said. "The ability to kind of curate, study, listen to, try different things, expand your horizons, it just went up exponentially. "

That's how you get a guy like Solomon, age 55 and ensconced in the world of high finance, manning the turntables at beach parties in the Bahamas overrun with bikini-clad millennials.

He appears to have been reeled in as much by the business angle and the platforms commanded by top DJs as the sound itself.

Here's Solomon:

"And so as that happened I started getting more and more interested in different kinds of music. Music I really didn't have a lot of experience with. And five, seven years ago, I started really kind of taking note of club and EDM music and what was happening with all the electronic music, and I said: This is really interesting. Big business. And started looking at it, and I said: You know, I like some of this music. And started playing around with it, started reading about these DJs that really had these incredible platforms, and I said: You know what? This looks interesting. And kind of stumbled into it as a hobby, and now I just do it for fun."

He indulges his side hobby about once a month.

The Wall Street veteran says finding and exploring a passion is crucial to longevity in a career known for grinding people down and burning them out.

"If you can't find a way to have passions and pursue those passions and mix them into your professional life and your personal life in some way, shape or form, it's just harder to have the energy to keep on doing this, and to keep moving forward professionally," Solomon said.http://www.businessinsider.com/the-economic-cost-of-brexit-in-gdp-2017-11£72 BILLION: The cost of Brexit is already turning Britain into a second-rung nation-5Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost economic activity annually, according to an analysis of government figures.

Leaving the EU is already dragging down the British economy.

The UK is now growing more slowly than Japan or Italy.



LONDON — Chancellor Philip Hammond's annual budget, presented yesterday, has finally given Britain the first concrete numbers on the cost of Brexit.

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility published revised GDP growth numbers based on data following the June 2016 referendum. Those new estimates suggest that Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost annual economic activity by 2021, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation.

Previously, the best estimate of the economic damage leaving Europe will inflict on the UK came from a private estimate by one of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis's advisors, of about £22 billion per year, mostly from extra trade tariffs and barriers.

Here are the new GDP charts from the OBR.

They show other major economies such as the US, the EU, and Canada all growing faster now than they were in the six months prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016. Only in the UK has growth slowed, as the pound lost value and investors hit the pause button. Even Japan, an infamous economic basket case hobbled by years of stagnation, is doing better than the UK:

In terms of sequential GDP growth through Q3 2017, Britain now lags France and debt-ridden Italy, too. This chart of OECD data comes from Michael Baxter of Share Centre:

This next chart shows how much we are forecast to lose in GDP activity every year, based on the difference between the OBR's previous estimate in March and its new estimate, from updated post-referendum data:

The Resolution Foundation says the gap will represent a loss of £72 billion in 2021:

"The economy is now expected to be roughly £42 billion smaller at the start of 2022 than was thought back in March. This downgrade comes on top of the deterioration pencilled in after the Brexit vote of June 2016. As such, the latest GDP projections point to an economy that will be £72 billion (or 3.4 percent) smaller in 2021 than had been projected in March 2016."

That's £72 billion in lost jobs, revenues, consumer spending, and so on.

There are other factors at play, of course. A big one is the UK's chronic lack of productivity, exacerbated by its refusal to allow in the young immigrant workers to generate the income tax receipts its ageing population needs to pay for the NHS and its state pensions.

But the OBR's downward revisions from March to November of this year all come in the post-Brexit-vote period, and the only thing of macroeconomic substance that changed between then and now was the realisation that the UK is headed toward hard Brexit rather than a trade deal that would keep the country closely tied to the single market.http://www.businessinsider.com/hutch-ceo-beatrice-fischel-bock-home-redesign-photos-2017-11This 26-year-old CEO used her own interior design app to redo her entire home in just one week — see the before-and-after photos2Beatrice Fischel-Bock, founder and CEO of the interior design startup Hutch, recently used her own app to redesign her home.

The redesign took only one week.

Fischel-Bock was recently featured on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, in the Retail and Ecommerce category. Beatrice Fischel-Bock, 26, who runs the interior design startup Hutch, knew it was time to give her own home a new look. She lives in a Spanish-style bungalow in West Hollywood, and she was ready to "adultify" it. "I moved into this house in September 2015. It had so much character and was perfect for what I was looking for. I really wanted a place that had some integrity, and especially a place that was very California," she said in a press release. To create a more adult apartment, Fischel-Bock used her own company's app to get the job done in just one week. The 3D designer tool in the Hutch app allows users to visualize how furniture can be placed and what it will look like in the space. Below, take a look at how Fischel-Bock's charming home turned out. View As: One Page Slides

Fischel-Bock began the redesign process in the bedroom, which was mostly white before.

With the redesign, she aimed to create a more feminine, elevated, and relaxed feeling in the bedroom.

Without much color, the room felt barren before.

She added a splash of color with a framed collection above her bed. "My mom is an artist so I have picked up art throughout the years from my travels and visiting local flea markets," she said.

Originally, her bedside lamp had a makeshift addition to help adjust the light.

To add texture and more pops of color, she chose a wooden bedside table and a rose gold lamp.

Her redesigned bedroom includes Parachute Home bedding, West Elm curtains, and a Target side table.

The living room redesign focused on adding new furniture pieces and accents that created texture, like the rug.

She kept it simple with a clean, white couch, but added patterned pillows and a throw blanket to add texture and color.

The dining room includes various items from Cost Plus World Market, including the dining chairs and the lamp shade.

The aqua kitchen is accented with light-green, glass drawer knobs.http://www.businessinsider.com/34-billion-hedge-fund-tourbillon-capital-is-getting-whacked-2017-11Tourbillon Capital, a $3.4 billion hedge fund that's been sounding the alarm about 'frothy speculation,' is suffering big losses-5Tourbillon Capital is a $3.4 billion New York hedge fund led by Jason Karp.

Karp has been warning of "frothy speculation," in the markets and has been preaching patience.

The firm's flagship fund is down more than 10% for the year to November 17.



Tourbillon Capital, a $3.4 billion hedge fund firm led by Jason Karp, is suffering.

The firm's flagship Global Master fund is down 3.5% for the first 17 days of November, bringing performance for the year to November 17 to a loss of 10.6%, according to a note to investors seen by Business Insider. Its long-only fund was up about 10% through October, Business Insider previously reported.

In an October letter to investors, Karp preached patience, saying the fund saw "a number of warning signs that point to the middle innings of frothy speculation." Those comments echo earlier letters, which have discussed the challenges of managing money in the current bull market.

In the October letter, Karp added that despite this, there are investment opportunities for those willing to look "ugly" for some period of time.

Tourbillon currently manages about $3.4 billion firmwide, including long-only investments.

Before launching Tourbillon, Karp was a portfolio manager at Steve Cohen's SAC Capital and a co-chief investment officer at Carlson Capital.http://www.businessinsider.com/idws-ilana-weinstein-on-recruiting-for-hedge-fund-jobs-2017-11We asked a top hedge-fund recruiter what it takes to get a senior-level job these days0Ilana Weinstein is the founder of The IDW Group, which focuses on recruiting investment talent for all kinds of investment strategies.

We asked Weinstein about the biggest trends in the hedge-fund business and how to get a senior-level job today.

"As the industry has become more crowded and efficient, I would argue the definition of talent has gone up," she said.



Ilana Weinstein is a force within the hedge-fund industry, recruiting senior investment talent and C-level staffers for some of the biggest funds. Her firm's approach has gotten a reputation for being the "Don't call us, we'll call you" search firm — something Weinstein is completely fine with.

She founded The IDW Group about 15 years ago. The New York firm recruits investment talent specializing in all kinds of investment strategies, ranging from long-short equity to credit and macro. IDW also recruits for private-equity funds, asset managers, and family offices.

We wanted to get a sense of what it takes to get a top job in money management, and we reached out to Weinstein to get her two cents. She emailed us back with her thoughts. Following is a lightly edited transcript.

Rachael Levy: You are coming up on your 15th year since founding IDW. How have you seen this industry evolve?

Ilana Weinstein: When we started, in the beginning of 2003, the hedge-fund industry was still relatively nascent. There were 3,000 hedge funds compared to 9,000 today. AUM [assets under management] was $500 billion versus $3.4 trillion. That’s explosive growth. Talent doesn’t proliferate like that.

Back then, proprietary trading desks on the sell side were where we went for talent because they were like mini hedge funds and there weren’t enough developed hedge funds to pull from. After the crisis, prop trading became a "no-go" zone at the banks and anyone who was a risk-taker (and any good) left.

Today the war for talent is largely hedge fund to hedge fund, and as the industry has become more crowded and efficient, I would argue the definition of talent has gone up.

There is less alpha in the market, less volatility, less dispersion, and more market participants. If you get five consumer portfolio managers in a room with 20 ideas each, you don’t get 100 ideas. You are lucky if you get five to six. There aren’t enough factors to make 80% of hedge funds do well.

The list of truly investable hedge funds is probably 2% of existing funds. And concentration of AUM reflects this: 10% of hedge funds control 90% of the AUM. That’s a surprising statistic to a lot of people. It also means seismic changes can happen quickly.

We’ve seen big institutional funds like Eton Park and Perry shut down; other large players have had enormous and swift AUM drops. This leads to a recalibration of who the best funds are, and where talent wants to be.

Levy: What is your approach to recruiting?

Weinstein: Think of a Venn diagram with one bubble being best-in-class, stand-out talent, and the other being miserable, disenfranchised players whose résumés are papering the street. We have never cared about the second bubble. We are not in the business of helping people find jobs. The niche IDW has cultivated is to help the best funds attract exceptional talent. We only go after that first bubble. If there is overlap, it's a happy coincidence.

Levy: What are some recent trends you have seen with regard to talent?

Weinstein: We are all about, and only about, cultivating the most talented people in our industry.

Historically, the overlap between those two bubbles was low; as you might expect, talented people sat at what they thought were the best funds and were not receptive to leaving. This made our job difficult because we were only as strong as our ability to create an opportunity that didn't exist where they were.

Now many people are telling us how frustrated they are — so that overlap in my Venn diagram has never been greater. It feels like we at the center of a perfect storm.

It feels like we at the center of a perfect storm.

Even if fund performance is better this year, we are still coming off the back of three to four years where these people outperformed the funds in which they work. If you have multiple years of profit and loss where you were the bulk of your fund’s return — sometimes in its entirety — and then have compensation netted by poor performance in other parts of the fund, you start to question the value proposition.

These last few years have given these investment professionals more experience and confidence and made them more willing to bet on themselves. I recently interviewed someone who referred to this as “labor arbitrage” — his view of how he was being taken advantage of at the fund in which he sits. The risk-reward dynamic of staying and leaving changes. Funds that have the resources and forward-thinking-ness to seize this moment are going to pick up the best people in our business.

Levy: How would you describe the current hiring environment?

Weinstein: Robust! All the doomsayers in 2016 who predicted industry AUM would fall by some big percent were dead wrong. The industry has never managed more capital that it does today. That is the yardstick of health for our business.

However, LP patience is thin, and we are going to see more funds — big ones — shutter or become family offices. There will be a shakeout in this industry, and there should be. Yet overall AUM is growing, so that means those that remain will get bigger and there will be space for new entrants who can build something unique.

That said, you need to be rich to start a hedge fund now, to build something attractive to institutional LPs. The industry is moving to greater scale and more sophistication. Those that can leverage scale and invest in people and systems to drive opportunities will win.

Levy: So if once upon a time the natural progression was to leave and start a fund but that is tougher now, where do these talented people go?

Weinstein: The best platforms are becoming more creative and bespoke about how they attract talent. I liken it to a managed account for an LP. There are accommodations made for someone truly unique — maybe more flexibility with risk parameters, concentration or the ability to invest in privates. More capital out of the gate — resources to build and train a team.

And then economics to take a lot of the risk off the table in the near term and unlimited upside longer term. If the choice is go at it on your own — bang the tin cup for capital, have a never-ending series of marketing meetings — and even if things go well still spend 20% to 30% of your time marketing because there is a natural 10% attrition of capital every year, and on top of this fund this enterprise out of your pocket until you break even (if you ever do) versus be plug and play somewhere, which will give you incredible resources, why take that risk?

And just to underscore that point, we are helping platforms gobble up small funds because the economics and time allocation of marketing versus investing no longer makes sense for these smaller guys.

Similarly, funds that have a real partnership are interesting. “Partner” is an overused and often meaningless title in our industry.

'Partner' is an overused and often meaningless title in our industry.

I can’t tell you the number of partners we meet, from big funds who can barely articulate what it means beyond looking good on their business card. Giving someone small points and then a “jump ball” for more is still a discretionary compensation model, in my view. It’s a convoluted way of saying the same thing. Once you get to a point where you are ready to do your own thing, you want to build something or having a meaningful stake in doing so.

The best platforms get you there as do funds with a real partnership and culture of meritocracy. We recently took a senior guy out of a firm he had been at for 14 years. He left because the founder created a role around him that leveraged his ability to build a business and mentor a team. Joining a $30 billion fund as a partner with a clear path on how to grow that stake and work directly for a founder who is brilliant at what he does and always expanding in ways that complement the fund’s strengths is exciting.

Levy: What has most surprised you in 15 years of interviewing the best people in this business?

Weinstein: How hard it can be to get them to make a move! Even now where they are the most receptive because of this disconnect between their performance and that of their fund, I still see the economic loss-aversion theory at play. These are people who are the most talented at taking risk for a living and yet when it comes to assessing their own career they have an inherent bias to weight the risks of a new opportunity over what they are likely to gain.

It’s amazing how lopsided their thinking can be, but luckily they are also highly rational, so once they wrap their head around what they are doing they can make the leap.

Levy: What is the most misunderstood aspect of the hedge-fund industry by hedge-fund investors?

Weinstein: Four things.

How lean these investment teams are. You can be a $10 billion-plus fund and have a team of five to 10 people if it’s a single-strategy fund. That means it is critical that everyone contribute in a meaningful way, but that is often not the case.

The strength of investment teams is lumpy. You may say so what but when the team is lean it matters. This is obfuscated when fund performance is good because everyone is happy and doing well and there is less individual accounting going on. Over the last few years returns were more challenging and it became clear who the stars are. If they leave it’s a problem.

Right now many talented people are unhappy and in-play LPs should know the hedge-fund industry is like a giant Jenga puzzle. All you need is a few key people to leave, returns drop, and the whole thing comes crashing down. If I’m an LP, I want to know who is key on the team and likelihood of them leaving. I don’t think anyone has this bird’s-eye view but us.

"Turnover" is not a bad word. Founders are often afraid of letting people go because of the perception of turnover by LPs. LPs should encourage founders to prune their team. This also makes room for talented people to grow and not be as vulnerable to our call. The key is for LPs to diligence who drove the turnover (founder or the person who left) and what the reputation is of the person leaving. The story that gets spun after the fact is often not the reality.

Levy: What do you think investment professionals in this industry most underestimate about themselves?

Weinstein: How difficult the transition is from analyst to portfolio manager to founder. These are different skill sets and people overrate their ability to make these transitions. An analyst is an idea generator. Once he becomes a portfolio manager he is no longer deploying capital through the lens of the founder. He is now responsible for portfolio construction, sizing, and hedging. The buck stops with him. I can’t tell you the number of people who don’t fully appreciate this ahead of time and flame out. As a founder you are building a team, running a business and dealing with LPs. There is little about an investment professional’s training that prepares him for this.

My second point is one I see talent becoming savvier about and that is how quickly things can change. Now that they have seen several large funds shut down and others struggling, there is more awareness about asking the right questions about where they sit.

Just because it’s a big, brand-name fund that doesn’t mean it is a stable seat. They need to look around and ask: "Are our returns differentiated? Are talented people likely to leave? Is the founder committed to investing in people, resources, and technology — effectively the future? Or is he just resting on his laurels?" That’s the kind of stuff we help people see through. Inertia is a killer and it’s a shame for a talented person not to be everything he can because he doesn’t have broader perspective.

Levy: What is critical for founders to know to hang on to their best people?

Weinstein: Founders need to provide their people with four things.

Impact: Their people need to feel like they can impact the bottom line. Even if the founder is the ultimate arbiter of how capital is deployed, if he has the right team they should be able to influence these decisions in a material way. Transparency: Clarity around how they are measured; what they need to do to progress; why and how capital gets allocated. This is a pay-for-performance culture, and people need to feel connected to the results of the fund as well on their own trajectory. Scope: Measured by remit and access to capital. As people progress they want to do more — maybe it’s a sector PM who now wants to expand to other sectors. Founders need to find a way to let talented people develop, or they will lose them. Compensation: Obviously an important one and you need to know the market and be in line with that but if the above three are in good shape this one usually is too. It’s also the easiest one for a founder to fix.

Levy: What advice would you give to a young person coming out of school who wants to join a hedge fund? What kind of educational background are funds looking for now?

Weinstein: Focus on what lights you up — not the dollar signs. There are thousands of hedge funds, and most won’t make it.

There are thousands of hedge funds, and most won’t make it.

It’s like the dot-com bubble when I was coming out of school. Unless you live and breathe investing and everything that goes on in your area of interest, this is not for you. What I am most inspired by is passion. This manifests itself through someone who is on fire about what is evolving in his industry, sector, how committed he is. I know it when I see it.

I wouldn’t worry much about majors. School is a time to expand your horizons and learn how to think. That skill set and flexibility will serve you better as an investor than any individual class. I have had a few founders disparage the value of an MBA. They would rather the person spent those two years in an investing seat going through different markets. As an MBA myself I am mixed on that, but I understand the point.

Levy: What career advice would you give in general?

Weinstein:Always work harder than everyone else so you know you gave it your all. Very few people consistently put in 110%. It takes discipline but it’s worth it. It goes to the concept of grit too. I always tell my 13-year-old: "Being smart doesn’t count for much unless you pair that with exceptional effort." I didn’t have much growing up — I went to Stuyvesant High, which fostered an immigrant survivor culture — there was no safety net. No one was going to help me so I had to do it myself. That sense of needing to make it work also builds confidence because you see what you can do on your own and overcome.

That sense of needing to make it work also builds confidence because you see what you can do on your own and overcome.

It gives you the confidence to take risks. I wouldn’t be where I am if not for that set of experiences.

You also have to keep moving forward and not take things personally. I deal with a lot of colorful and sometimes intense personalities. I won’t deal with bad people, but other than that I can pretty much handle anything! It sounds clichéd, but it is true. If things don’t go your way, pick yourself up and move on. You will learn from it and do better next time. Don’t get bogged down in negativity.

As my dad often said: "Don’t sweat the small stuff. It’s all small stuff." I have to remind myself of that sometimes because I care deeply about what I do, but dwelling on negative things is not productive.

Weinstein: What was the most formative moment in your career?

Levy: I was at a big search firm and thinking about starting my own company. I didn’t know if I could build a business but knew I was good at what I did. I asked a client if he worked with me because of me or the fact that I was part of a big firm. I don’t know if he knew what was behind my question but he said, “Ilana I don’t even know the name of your firm.” Of course he was being cute but it gave me the confidence to go for it.

Levy: Why are there so few women in investing seats, and what needs to be done to change that?

Weinstein: I gave a lecture on the hedge-fund industry at Wharton earlier this year, and one of the female students asked me that. I in turn asked how many women in the room wanted to join a hedge fund, and barely any hands went up. I then asked how many men, and about 70% of the guys raised their hands.

So there is self-selection going on which makes the pool shallow. You then factor in attrition, and by the time we get there we have very few talented women to pull from.

I can tell you, founders do want more women, but this is a meritocracy — they have a fiduciary duty to their LPs to hire the best possible person. If we had more women electing to go into the industry, we would have better numbers. It’s also a circular loop — women don’t see many female role models, so this dampens their interest. That being said, I do think there is something to this industry still being relatively young.

Look at law, medicine, banking, and consulting. They all have better female representation in senior roles. When I was at Harvard, the MBA class was roughly 30% female. Now I am told it is closer to 50%. So hopefully this is something that changes over time, but we have to do a better job of encouraging talented women to join from the get-go.http://www.businessinsider.com/r-update-1-moves-hsbc-investment-banker-westerman-leaves-2017-11Top investment banker Matthew Westerman leaves HSBC less than two years after joining-3Matthew Westerman was HSBC's co-head of global banking for just under two years.

His departure from the bank was announced in an internal memo by chief executive Samir Assaf.

It is thought that Westerman did not fit inthe collegiate culture at the bank.



LONDON, Nov 23 (IFR) - Matthew Westerman, HSBC's co-head of global banking, is leaving the British bank, less than two years after his high-profile arrival from Goldman Sachs.

HSBC did not give any reason for his departure in an internal memo from Samir Assaf, chief executive of HSBC's global banking and markets, which was seen by IFR.

His global banking co-head Robin Phillips will assume day-to-day management of the business after a period of transition, the memo said.

Westerman had clashed with other people at the bank and had not fit in with HSBC's more collegiate culture, according to one person who worked with him.

Westerman was hired by Stuart Gulliver and was close to the outgoing chief executive. Gulliver is stepping down as CEO in February after seven years in charge, to be replaced by John Flint, the head of retail banking and wealth management.

Westerman did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.

He was hired in February 2016 and was seen as a potential candidate to step up and run the investment bank at some point in the future.

Westerman spent 16 years at Goldman, where he was most recently chairman of its investment banking division in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Sources said at the time he had planned to retire from Goldman, when the call came from HSBC.

His arrival at HSBC was a surprise, but he had had close ties to HSBC and Gulliver for some time, as Goldman was HSBC's corporate broker and he worked on the bank's £12.8 billion rights issue in 2009 and other transactions.

Assaf said in the memo that Westerman had made a "significant contribution" to re-shaping the global banking business alongside Phillips.

They had "together driven improved financial and market share performance and reinvigorated our approach to collaboration in global banking and markets, as well as across commercial banking," the memo said.

But Westerman had sharpened divisions at the bank, including with bonus payments, Bloomberg reported. It said he had introduced a harsher end-of-year review procedure and promoted a smaller percentage of candidates to managing director.http://www.businessinsider.com/r-airbus-ceo-questioned-in-kazakh-deal-investigation-reports-2017-11Airbus CEO questioned in Kazakh deal investigation: reports-5PARIS (Reuters) - French anti-corruption investigators questioned Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders and three other company executives as witnesses in an investigation centered on the sale of satellites to Kazakhstan in 2010, according to media reports on Thursday.

Enders was interviewed in early October by anti-corruption investigators in Nanterre, close to Paris, as was Chairman Denis Ranque, Mediapart, France Inter and Der Spiegel reported.

Authorities are probing an alleged suspect payment linked to the satellite deal, Mediapart reported, adding that Enders and the other executives were not alleged to have any role in it.

"We have no comment to make other than that we are fully co-operating with authorities," a spokesman for Airbus said.

Enders is grappling with scrutiny over Airbus's sales practices after the company uncovered inaccuracies in its filings to U.S. regulators over arms technology sales. That came on top of existing bribery investigations in France and Britain over the use of middlemen in jetliner sales. [nL8N1N60W2]

France and Germany each hold 11 percent of Airbus.

France's finance minister said recently that Enders had the confidence of Airbus's board, while the German government has also rebuffed speculation about Enders's future.

(Reporting by Sarah White and Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Adrian Croft)http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-tax-reform-bill-analysis-reviews-text-2017-11The GOP tax plan got a triple whammy of brutal reviews-3Three new analyses of the Senate's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act all delivered bad news for Republican leaders.

The Tax Policy Center found that more than 50% of Americans would see a tax increase in 2027 under the bill.

Only one out of 42 economists surveyed by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business said the bill would increase economic growth substantially.

The Penn-Wharton Budget Model found that the bill would blow a hole in the federal deficit.



While Congress is on a weeklong Thanksgiving break, the breakneck speed of the Republican push to overhaul the US tax code has taken a bill close to passing in the Senate.

The latest version of the chamber's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed the Senate Finance Committee last Thursday, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants to bring the bill for a full Senate vote when lawmakers return from the recess.

But on Tuesday, Republicans were hit with something of a triple whammy: Three different groups offered critical analyses of the bill's potentially negative effects on the federal budget, Americans' taxes, and the broader US economy. While the Senate is still expected to make changes to the legislation, each of the new studies shows that the Senate's bill has some significant underlying problems.

Tax Policy Center says it would raise taxes on half of Americans

Perhaps the most damning of the new reports came from the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution's Tax Policy Center.

The nonpartisan group's analysis of the legislation found that while all income groups would get a tax cut from the bill in the short term and long term, many Americans would see their taxes increase. From the report:

In 2019: Americans, on average, would see their taxes cut by $1,300, an increase in take-home pay of 1.7%. Americans in the middle quintile of income earners — $50,000 to $87,000 a year — would get a tax cut of $850, on average, and receive 18.4% of the tax cuts' benefits. People in the top 1% of incomes, more than $750,000 a year, would see a cut of $34,130, on average, and receive 17.6% of the bill's total benefit.

Americans, on average, would see their taxes cut by $1,300, an increase in take-home pay of 1.7%. Americans in the middle quintile of income earners — $50,000 to $87,000 a year — would get a tax cut of $850, on average, and receive 18.4% of the tax cuts' benefits. People in the top 1% of incomes, more than $750,000 a year, would see a cut of $34,130, on average, and receive 17.6% of the bill's total benefit. In 2027: The bill's proposed sunset of the individual tax cuts, combined with other changes to the code, means benefits would be substantially less for the middle class. The average cut for all Americans would be just $300, and 50.3% of American households would actually see their taxes increase by this point. Those in the middle quintile of earners would see a tax cut of just $50, on average, and 65.6% of these people would see their taxes go up. People in the top 1% of income earners, however, would still get a tax cut of $32,510, on average, and would receive 61.8% of the total tax benefits from the plan. Just 16.8% of people in the top 1% would see a tax increase.

Economists do not think the bill will grow the economy

Trump and Republicans have argued that the cuts in the plan would stimulate economic growth and even help "pay for" its new spending. Most economists aren't buying the rosy projections.

But according to the IGM Forum survey of 42 academic economists by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, only one economist agreed that "US GDP will be substantially higher a decade from now" than under the current baseline. In fact, 52% disagreed or strongly disagreed that the bill would lead to significant economic growth, and 36% were uncertain.

And when asked whether the "US debt-to-GDP ratio will be substantially higher" in 10 years under the bill compared with current law, 88% of the economists agreed or strongly agreed, 2% were uncertain, and the rest abstained.

Penn-Wharton budget model says the bill would blow a hole in the deficit

The final rough analysis for the legislation came from a new report from the University of Pennsylvania, using its Penn-Wharton Budget Model to assess the budgetary effects of the bill.

While Trump administration officials say the legislation would pay for itself, some Senate Republicans have been hesitant to support the bill over concerns that it would cause a massive increase in the federal debt.

The Penn model found that the bill would increase the federal deficit by $1.327 trillion over the first 10 years after it becomes law (not including debt-service costs). Even when factoring in the economic boost from the tax cuts, according to the report, the bill would still add $1.271 trillion in debt.

Either way, the model concludes that much like the House version of the bill, the Senate bill would not come close to paying for itself.http://www.businessinsider.com/lamborghini-huracan-spyder-review-pictures-details-2017-11We drove a $314,000 Lamborghini Huracan Spyder — here's what impressed us most about the supercar3The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder starts at around $262,000, but our option heavy test car cost nearly $314,000.

The Huracan Spyder is the drop-top variant of Lamborghini's hot-selling entry-level supercar.

Our Huracan test car delivered Lamborghini performance with an extra dose of sunshine.

Before it's all said and done, the Huracan will be the best selling Lamborghini supercar of all time. In just three years, Lamborghini has sold more than 9,000 Huracans worldwide. It took Lamborghini a decade to sell 14,000 Gallardos, the current record holder. And it's not hard to see why it's so popular with the brand's customers. The Huracan is fast and agile with smoldering good looks and an intoxicating exhaust note. In 2015, Lambo's entry-level offering was a runner-up for our Car of the Year Award that year. But what happens when you chop the top off the Huracan? Did the lack soft-top muzzle the Huracan's sparkling personality or spoil its stylish silhouette? To find out, we spent a week with a Balloon White Huracan Spyder. View As: One Page Slides

The Facts The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder is powered by 5.2-liter, naturally aspirated V10 producing 602 horsepower. The Lambo gets all that power to the road through a seven-speed twin-clutch gearbox and an advanced all-wheel-drive system. The Huracan is also available in rear-wheel-drive. However, that version gets a detuned 572 horsepower version of the same engine. According to Lamborghini, the all-wheel-drive Huracan can hit 62 mph in a blistering 3.4 seconds and reach a top speed of 201 mph. The Huracan Spyder starts at a shade over $262,000 with our option laden test car coming out to nearly $314,000.

Raising the roof Like its corporate cousin, the Audi R8 Spyder, the Huracan gets a tough canvas roof instead of a folding metal affair popular among high-priced drop tops these days. The top is available in three colors; black, brown, and red. Our test car came with the red top. The electro-hydraulic roof can be raised and lowered in just 17 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. As with any convertible, the minute the roof is lopped off, chassis rigidity is compromised. Even with heavy-duty chassis reinforcements to make up for the missing roof, performance is lacking when compared to the coupe counterpart. The question is whether or not Lamborghini has done enough to overcome that. Well, I can honestly say, yes. The carbon fiber and aluminum-intensive chassis feels rock solid. Lamborghini claims the Huracan Spyder's chassis is 40% stiffer than its predecessor, the Gallardo Spyder. Scuttle shake was nowhere to be found. Even on New Jersey's notoriously pot hole heavy roads. ("Scuttle shake" is annoying vibrations commonly exhibited by cars with lower chassis rigidity that experience too much flex.)

The experience On the road, the Huracan Spyder is superb. The heart of this beast is the naturally aspirated V10, shared with the Audi R8. As loud and enthusiastic as the motor is in the Audi, in the Lambo its dialed up to 11. There's an added level of raw power and emotion that simply doesn't exist in the Audi. Best of all, there are no turbochargers around to disturb the velvety smooth power delivery of the V10 nor are they present to muffle the sweet music of the ten-cylinder symphony. The twin-clutch gearbox pairs well with the broad powerband of the engine like the dry red and juicy steak. Around the corners, the Huracan Spyder remains well behaved and composed even when pushed to its limits. The all-wheel-drive Lambo is so docile that my colleague Matt DeBord felt that this raging bull was simply not angry enough. However, anyone looking to spend time sideways in a Lamborghini should take a look at the less powerful, but wilder rear-wheel-drive Huracan. Retract the top and the Huracan Spyder takes it to a whole another level. With the air whizzing past you, the rumble of the V10 resonating behind your hear, and a kiss of sunshine on your forehead Lamborghini motoring en plein air is something to be experienced.http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-company-scandals-and-controversies-2017-11Uber is in hot water after a major cyberattack cover-up — here's the long list of scandals the company has weathered so far-5Uber is plagued by a long list of scandals, ranging from reports of sexual harassment to aggressive strategies to take down the competition.

The company has recently been in the news for the wrong reasons, dealing with sexual harassment claims, the loss of executives including its CEO, and most recently a cyber attack cover-up.

However, Uber has been creating controversy far before 2017.

Uber is in hot water after a cover-up scandal involving a major security breach. The ride-hailing company paid hackers $100,000 to cover up a cyberattack that exposed 57 million people's personal data in October 2016, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. And, while passengers and drivers only found out this week, ex-CEO Travis Kalanick reportedly found out about the breach last year. This is far from the first time executives' decisions have blown up in Uber's face. Uber's scandals range from arguably unethical business strategies to sexual assault allegations. Here's an attempt to understand exactly what Uber has done to become a $68 billion company. Biz Carson contributed to an earlier version of this story. View As: One Page Slides

October 2010: UberCab receives its first cease and desist According to New York Magazine's extensive list of Uber's ups and downs, the company's first scandal came before the startup changed its name from UberCab to Uber. Four months after launching in San Francisco, the San Francisco Metro Transit Authority & the Public Utilities Commission of California issued a cease and desist order. UberCab changed its name to Uber. Six years later, San Francisco would have roughly 45,000 Uber drivers, compared to just 2,026 licensed taxis.

January 2012: Uber gets slammed in its first major surge pricing backlash Uber told customers that prices would increase due to increased demand on New Years Eve. However, people were still furious when they were forced to pay three to six-times the normal amount to get a ride.

November 2012: Prices soar during Hurricane Sandy With most public transportation down in New York City, Ubers were in high demand, leading to prices doubling. After being accused to price gouging, the company made prices revert back to normal, while continuing to pay drivers two times the rate.

September 2013: A passenger accuses an Uber driver of choking her Washington, D.C., resident Bridget Todd tweeted that a driver grabbed her out of the car by her throat because she was kissing her "white husband." The driver said that Todd was extremely intoxicated and had been behaving aggressively, and a fight had broken out between them. Valleywag reported that CEO Travis Kalanick emailed the company's press team at the time, blaming the media for thinking that Uber is "somehow liable for these incidents that aren't even real in the first place."

December 2013: Uber drivers file a lawsuit against the company The suit, filed on behalf of 350,000 current and former Uber drivers in California and Massachusetts, claims that drivers should be treated as employees, not contract workers. If the drivers were to be considered employees, Uber would have to pay minimum wage and provide benefits such as health insurance. The case was settled out of court in 2016.

January 2014: Uber employees purposefully waste rival drivers' time "Uber employees have been posing as pedestrians, creating Gett accounts for the sole purpose of scheduling and then canceling Gett rides," Valleywag's Sam Biddle reported. "The result is clear: wasted time for Gett drivers, fewer available rides for Gett users, and general disarray for the whole service." According to Valleywag, top Uber executives in New York City were allegedly involved in the plan and would try and convince the drivers to work for Uber. At the time, Uber called the strategy a "sales tactic" that got "too aggressive."

January 2014: Reports emerge that an Uber driver accused of assault has a criminal record Pando reported that an Uber driver who allegedly called a user a "dirty Mexican faggot" had a "criminal record, including felony and misdemeanor charges, and at least one felony conviction involving prison time."

February 2014: Kalanick calls Uber "Boob-er," prompting questions regarding the company's treatment of women A GQ profile of the CEO reads: "When I tease him about his skyrocketing desirability, he deflects with a wisecrack about women on demand: 'Yeah, we call that Boob-er.'" In the same profile, Kalanick says he'd rather be clubbing than working when he's in Miami. Unsurprisingly, many saw this as a red flag for the company's culture.

August 2014: Uber is slammed for trying to undermine Lyft The Verge reported: "Uber is arming teams of independent contractors with burner phones and credit cards as part of its sophisticated effort to undermine Lyft and other competitors." Similar to attempts to waste Gett drivers' time, Uber reportedly used this as a strategy to undermine Lyft and other rivals.

October 2014: Uber is criticized for sexism after "hot chicks" promotion Uber's branch in Lyon, France debuted a promotion to pair Uber customers with "hot chick" drivers. After backlash, the promotion was quickly killed and scrubbed from the internet. "I am not surprised that someone inside the company took Kalanick's callous attitude towards female riders and comments like 'Boober' to mean that shocking level of exploitation and disrespect was appropriate — that it would even be celebrated by HQ," Pando's Sarah Lacy wrote of the incident.

November 2014: A senior executives suggest the company should dig up dirt on reporters that cover Uber BuzzFeed reported that Emil Michael, then Uber’s senior vice president of business, suggested that Uber should invest in opposition research on reporters during a private dinner he believed to be off the record. "Over dinner, he outlined the notion of spending 'a million dollars' to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists," BuzzFeed reported. "That team could, he said, help Uber fight back against the press — they'd look into 'your personal lives, your families,' and give the media a taste of its own medicine." Michael said he regretted the comments and that they didn't reflect his or Uber's views.

December 2014: Uber is banned in Delhi after rape accusation The region of India banned Uber after a passenger reported that she was taken to a secluded area and raped by her driver.

May 2015: Uber reportedly poaches 50 employees from Carnegie Mellon’s top robotics lab The Verge reported: "Uber snatched up about 50 people from Carnegie Mellon, including many from its highest ranks. That's an unusually high number of people to leave at once, and accounted for about a third of the staff NREC had at the end of last year."

June 2015: French taxi drivers slam Uber as "economic terrorism" French officials investigated the company and taxi drivers strike to protest the company's attempts to expand its low-cost UberPOP service. "'Economic terrorism' is the favored term of Parisian taxi drivers for Uber’s lower prices, flexible hours and the way it is operating outside French law," the New York Times reported. French courts cracked down on Uber, and UberPOP was discontinued in the country.

January 2016: Uber strikes a settlement following concerns regarding 'God View' tracking In November 2014, Buzzfeed reported that Uber had tracked one of its reporters using a tool nicknamed "God View" that allowed the company to track cars and see personal information of the drivers in the cars. Uber struck a settlement with the New York Attorney General, ending an investigation into the company's privacy practices, including its use of "God View." The company paid a $20,000 fine for not disclosing a data breach in a timely manner. It also removed personal information from tracking and limited which employees could use the tool.

February 2016: Uber agrees to pay $28.5 million to end a lawsuit about safety ads Uber agreed to pay $28.5 million to 25 million riders after plaintiffs in two lawsuits argued the company misled customers about safety practices. As part of the settlement, Uber must refrain from using certain superlatives like "industry-leading" or "best in class" when describing its background checks.

February 2016: Uber driver accused of shooting eight people Uber driver Jason Dalton is accused of shooting eight people, six fatally, around Kalamazoo, Michigan. Dalton had no criminal history and passed Uber's background checks. Dalton's rating as an Uber driver was "good," according to its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan. In March, Dalton blamed Uber for the attack when he said to investigators that the app made him "like a puppet."

May 2016: Uber pulls out of Austin, Texas after teaming up with Lyft to spend more than $8 million campaigning to change laws in the city Voters ultimately backed a law that requires drivers to get fingerprint background checks, despite Uber and Lyft's expensive campaign against the measure.

August 2016: Judge rejects Uber's $100 million settlement with drivers In April, Uber announced that it had agreed to settle a court case brought by drivers in California and Massachusetts for $84 million — $100 million if the company goes public at a higher valuation. "Judge Edward Chen denied the plaintiff's motion to settle the case, saying that it was neither fair nor accurate, citing the tipping policy as one change not nearly as valuable as the settlement had suggested," Business Insider reported at the time.

December 2016: Kalanick announces he will join Trump's economic-advisory council, along with other business leaders In January, the #DeleteUber movement led to a flurry of account deletions by customers upset about the company's ties to President Trump. The company lost more than 200,000 customers in just one weekend.

February 2017: A female engineer who used to work at Uber publishes a blog post about sexual harassment and gender inequality at the company Susan Fowler writes in a blog post that she was sexually harassed at Uber and experienced gender bias during her time at the company. She claims a manager propositioned her and asked for sex, but she says her complaints to Uber's human resources department were dismissed because the manager was a high performer. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick immediately pledges to look into Fowler's allegations, and the company hires Eric Holder, a former US attorney general, to lead an independent investigation into its workplace culture. In a follow-up story, The New York Times reported Uber employees allegedly did cocaine during a company retreat and a manager had to be fired after groping multiple women.

February 2017: Uber investors blast the company for cultural shortcomings In an open letter to Uber's investors and board, Freada and Mitch Kapor say Uber has ignored their years long behind-the-scenes efforts to positively influence the company's culture. "We are speaking up now because we are disappointed and frustrated; we feel we have hit a dead end in trying to influence the company quietly from the inside," the Kapors write.

February 2017: Another ride-hailing service sues Uber over claims of property theft Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving-car division, accuses Uber of using stolen technology to advance its own autonomous-car development. The suit claims a team of ex-Google engineers stole Waymo's design for the laser sensor that allows self-driving cars to map the environment around them.

February 2017: Kalanick is caught fighting with an Uber drive on camera Bloomberg publishes a video showing Kalanick losing his cool in an argument with an Uber driver after the driver confronted him about reduced fares. Kalanick issues a "profound" apology and says he'll seek leadership help. "My job as your leader is to lead…and that starts with behaving in a way that makes us all proud," he wrote in his apology note. "That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away. This is the first time I've been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it."

March 2017: The New York Times reveals Uber has been secretly deceiving authorities for years with a tool called 'Greyball' Uber used the tool to evade authorities, particularly at times when city regulators were trying to block the ride-hailing service, according to a report by The Times' Mike Isaac. The tool collected data from Uber's app to identify and evade officials in cities like Boston, Paris, and Las Vegas. The Times reports that the program was used in markets where Uber was banned or being resisted by law enforcement.

March 2017: Executives flee the company Five executives left the company in less than a month in late February and early March, including Uber's senior vice president of engineering Amit Singhal, who stepped down amid allegations of sexual harassment. Singhal, who passed Uber's standard background checks before joining the company, strenuously denied the allegations.

March 2017: Travis Kalanick's visit to a Seoul escort-karaoke bar is revealed A report by The Information describes a 2014 visit by an Uber team to an escort-karaoke bar in Seoul. According to the report, "four male Uber managers picked women out of the group, calling out their numbers, and sat with them." After the evening, a female Uber employee told the company's HR department the trip made her uncomfortable, according to the report.

April 2017: A report claims Apple CEO Tim Cook had threatened to yank Uber's app from the App Store The New York Times reports Cook accused Uber of violating the App Store's terms and conditions. Uber had incorporated into its app a small piece of code that could identify particular phones, even if after they had been wiped of their data. The ride-hailing company had included the code to prevent fraud, according to the report. The software allowed the company to detect if someone was using the same phone over and over again but wiping it repeatedly to take advantage of promo codes.

May: Uber has to pay out millions after a bad accounting error Uber reveals an accounting mistake caused it to shortchange its drivers in New York City for years. Uber tells drivers in New York City it will repay them "tens of millions" of dollars after it took more than its share of the fares customers paid for rides. On average, most drivers in the city will receive about $900, the company says.

June: Uber fires over 20 people for bad behavior Uber fires more than 20 employees as a result of its internal investigation. The company says it received 215 complaints during its inquiry into inappropriate behavior at its workplace, with the highest number of complaints related to discrimination, sexual harassment, and unprofessional behavior.

June 7: Uber fires a senior executive for carrying around Indian rape victim's medical records Uber fires its head of Asia business, Eric Alexander. Alexander had been reportedly carrying around the medical records of a rape victim from India for a year and had shown them to other top executives. Uber's top executives, including Kalanick, allegedly looked at the records and pointed to them while internally questioning whether the rape occurred, according to a report in Recode. The executives also speculated that one of Uber's rivals in India could have been using the report of the rape to undermine the company there, according to the report. A day later the victim sues Uber over the mishandling of her private information.

June 8: The infamous "Miami Letter" becomes public Recode publishes an internal message the CEO sent before the 2013 event. Reading a lot like what a college fraternity president might send out to his brothers, the email, which Kalanick sent out to hundreds of employees before the 2013 event and again the following year, spelled out company rules about drinking and sex.

June: Uber's business chief and Kalanick confidant is pushed out Uber's business chief Emil Michael is forced to resign amid board pressure, bringing the number of executives to leave the company since the beginning of the year to an even dozen. Emil Michael had overseen Uber's broader business strategy, including its partnerships and fundraising. Michael, who was known to have a direct role in several of Uber's scandals, resigns as the company nears the completion of its internal investigation. He blames the board, and not his own behavior, for his departure from the company, Bloomberg reports.

July 2017: Kalanick reportedly says he plans to return as CEO just a month after stepping down Kalanick resigned as Uber's CEO in June after investors demanded that he step down following an internal investigation into the company's culture. The ex-CEO told several people at the company that he was "Steve Jobs-ing it", a reference to the cofounder of Apple who was fired from the company but later returned and turned it into the world's most valuable firm, according to Recode. Board members later shot down rumors that Kalanick would return.

Honda recalled the car because it could catch on fire. It's unclear whether Uber executives in San Francisco or then-CEO Travis Kalanick knew of the recall.

So Business Insider asked more than 40 Black Friday workers to share their best advice for shoppers and what mistakes they should avoid. Here are 12 tips that could help you get the most out of your Black Friday shopping experience. View As: One Page Slides

Unless you plan to be one of the first people in line, don't bother camping out or lining up "The big-deal items are very limited, so unless you're one of the first 10 in line, you're probably not going to get it. The rest of the products are still there a few hours later. And if you don't like crowds or waiting, stay home and order online or wait until Friday afternoon when it's slower in the stores."

The same goes for whether you want the doorbuster "Unless there's a doorbuster you need, don't waste your time. Cyber Monday has some good deals, too, and you can camp out for those deals in your pajamas in bed."

Plan ahead "On Black Friday so many people underestimate the time and energy it takes to do marathon shopping. If you are going with someone else, be sure they are as committed or as not committed to the experience as you are. "Taking two cars is probably a good idea. "Plan out your day: Where to go first, when to take a break, how long you want to be out. Give yourself extra time, too. Everything will take twice as long as you think. Be patient and be forgiving. Wear comfy shoes, and hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!"

Come prepared "If you drive a small car, please rent a larger one, because that 65-inch TV won't fit in the back of your car."

Do your research on what you want "One of the biggest mistakes people make is buying items without really looking into them. "Some of the computer systems on sale, for example, contain about half the new tech of similar ones, and if you waited, the prices would be comparable later on. "And many of the Black Friday sale tablets are often stripped models that have limited use. They're great to play games on, but forget hitting the internet or other uses."

And be aware of what you're really getting "Most of the bigger deals are actually outdated products. Yeah, you have your new tablets and phones, but those will be very limited in both how many there are and how much you can save. Most of the biggest and most tempting savings come from products that are at least a year old or more and they have to clear out the inventory in the warehouses." According to a study from NerdWallet, 93% of stores offered customers at least one product for the exact same price in 2014 as in their 2013 Black Friday ad.

Don't be duped by sale prices "The stuff is marked up from the original cost and then marked down to make people think they are getting a deal." According to The Wall Street Journal, retailers will slightly increase on the "normal" price of an item in the days before their Black Friday sales so that the discounts appear deeper. In fact, The Journal reported an 8% increase in a fifth of the sale items it tracked before Black Friday and a 23% uptick in the presale prices of toys and tools.

Don't fall for stores' tricks to get you to buy more "At higher-end stores, don't fall for the freebie prosecco or Pellegrino. Stores just want to keep you in there longer so you'll spend money." This isn't the only trick stores use to get you to spend more during the holiday season. "The stores are really desperate for your business and will stop at nothing to upsell you. "Where I worked, HQ would set next-to-impossibly high sales goals that each store was responsible for hitting. We were instructed that once we had someone on the line with money to spend, to 'keep her naked' in the dressing room and constantly bring her different colors, accessories, shoes, jewelry, Pellegrino, the works. The idea was that the more she tried on, the more you told her it to look great, the more she'd spend."

Some of the best deals are in the clearance section "The sales the day of aren't any better than the sales the week of. And sales, in general, aren't all that great. A lot of stuff is marked up to make it look like the Black Friday discounts are better than they actually are. If you really want a deal, look at the clearance section."

Be nice or pay the price "Black Friday shoppers tend to bang on doors, assuming that if they cause enough chaos, they will be allowed in. "Banging on the door will make all of us hate you. As in, if there is a chance to make your shopping experience a little more difficult via small, passive-aggressive actions, we will do it. Think $50 and $100 bill checks, 'a slow register,' and 'Aw, we just ran out of gift wrapping.' "All I can offer is, be nice. No one chooses to work the day after Thanksgiving."

Relax "I think everyone needs to have a lot of patience on Black Friday and enjoy the fun of shopping instead of making it stressful."http://www.businessinsider.com/r-workers-at-amazons-main-italian-site-to-hold-first-strike-on-black-friday-2017-11Workers at Amazon's main Italian site to hold first strike on Black Friday-3MILAN (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon's main distribution hub in Italy are planning their first ever strike for Friday, trade unions said, threatening to disrupt one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

Like the rest of Europe, Italians in recent years have embraced the U.S. tradition of Black Friday, a day of heavy discounting by retailers on the day after Thanksgiving.

Unions said in a statement more than 500 Amazon workers at the Piacenza site in northern Italy had agreed to strike following a failure to negotiate bonuses with the company.

Workers have also decided not to do any overtime until Dec. 31, covering the peak season for the online retailer which hires temporary workers during this period.

Amazon employs around 1,600 people on a permanent basis at the Piacenza site, the first it built in the country after launching its Italian website in 2010.

Amazon said in a statement it remained focused on trying to guarantee scheduled deliveries for its customers on Black Friday and in the following days.

The company said salaries paid to its workers were among the highest in the logistic sector and that it also provided some benefits such as private medical insurance or money to pay for training programs.

E-commerce is growing fast in Italy where online sales account only for 10 percent of overall retail sales, according to consultancy EY, half the European average.

This report is exclusively available to enterprise subscribers. Check to see if your company has access.

Banks are going to new lengths to attract and retain customers with mobile features.

In BI Intelligence's Mobile Banking Competitive Edge study, 83% of respondents said they use mobile banking. And banks are investing in mobile banking capabilities at unprecedented levels: Bank of America tripled its 2015 mobile banking budget in 2016, and maintained it through 2017, for example. Cutting-edge banking services are “table-stakes to attract and retain customers,” according to Michelle Moore, Head of Digital at Bank of America.

BI Intelligence’s first Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Report identifies which mobile banking and emerging features are most important to consumers when choosing a bank. The study ranks the largest 15 banks and credit unions in the US by whether they offer the mobile features that customers say they care most about. The report helps channel strategists choose which features they should focus their attention on, and lets them see how they compare to rival banks in offering those features.

This study uses exclusive data from the BI Insiders Panel (BIIP), an exclusive online community of 17,000 of our readers from all over the world. Designed to be a leading-edge indicator of what’s next in digital, BIIP members tend to be affluent, tech-savvy early adopters. This means that the BIIP community is an especially sensitive indicator of what consumers will buy and adopt, as well as what behaviors, devices, and platforms will be the winners in digital disruption.

Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:

Wells Fargo leads the pack. The bank offers in-demand mobile transfer capabilities, along with competitive features related to security and mobile wallets. USAA follows closely behind in second. Bank of America and Citi are tied for third, and Capital One rounds out the top five.

Mobile transfers are the most in-demand mobile features. Transfers are the most important category of features to consumers when choosing a bank, according to our study. The most in-demand feature in this study, instant transfers, is in this category. Transfers also include bill pay, international transfers, and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.

Post-Equifax, consumer interest in security tools is high. Security and control was the second most popular category in the study. Gen Xers value several features in this category — such as setting travel notifications and mobile access to ATMs — more than millennials.

Interest in advanced mobile banking account access is poised to jump. The account access section, the third most popular in this study, includes features like biometrics and account aggregation. With Face ID giving customers a new way to log in to banking, interest in the group of features will likely rise.

In spite of lagging adoption, interest in mobile wallets is still healthy. This category weighs not only whether banks support provisioning their cards in each of the popular wallets, but if they offer their own bank-branded wallets. Our study shows consumers rank support of third-party wallets as much more important than banking solutions.

wallets is still healthy. This category weighs not only whether banks support provisioning their cards in each of the popular wallets, but if they offer their own bank-branded wallets. Our study shows consumers rank support of third-party wallets as much more important than solutions. Conversational features have the lowest demand in the study. The voice- or chatbot-based banking tools in the category are desired by only a small fraction of consumers. Instead of using the features to attract new customers, banks are exploring offloading costly transitional conversations with live support staff to AI.

LUANDA/LONDON (Reuters) - On Oct. 6, with the dust still settling on Angola's first change of power in 38 years, new President João Lourenço sat down with international oil majors at the presidential palace in Luanda.

The top executives in Angola of Chevron , Total , BP , Eni and Exxon said the oil sector was being devastated by delays in project approvals at Sonangol and a backlog of payments owed by the state oil company, according to four oil industry sources with knowledge of the meeting.

They warned Lourenço that Angola's production would decline from 2019 unless swift action was taken to tackle problems at the firm, which was headed by Isabel dos Santos, daughter of his presidential predecessor, the sources said. They declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.

Six weeks later the president fired dos Santos, Africa's richest woman who is nicknamed the "princess" in Angola.

The oil majors all declined to comment on the meeting. Lourenço's office and Sonangol did not respond to requests for comment.

It was a highly unusual gathering; foreign oil firms operate nearly all of Angola's production and hold huge sway, but meeting the president as a united group was almost unheard of.

The nature of the discussions has not been previously reported. The talks, and subsequent events leading up to dos Santos' dismissal, shed light on the reasons behind her ouster - a decision never officially explained.

They offer new insight into the current state of the most important company in Angola, which relies on oil for a third of its economic output and over 95 percent of exports, and the big challenges facing the new management of the debt-laden firm.

The dismissal also points to the waning power of the dos Santos family, which has dominated Angolan politics and business for decades. Isabel dos Santos' father José Eduardo had ruled the country since 1979, amassing wealth for his relatives who own companies in almost every part of the economy.

'NEAR PARALYSIS'

Billionaire dos Santos, who had been Sonangol chair since June 2016, has said she was in the process of restructuring to root out waste and corruption at a company that was struggling even before oil prices plunged in mid-2014.

Her representatives declined to comment for this story, and instead pointed Reuters to two statements, issued in the days after her exit, when she outlined her achievements including reducing debt to $7 billion from $13 billion, raising annual revenue to $15.6 billion from $14.8 billion and cutting costs.

In her departing speech to staff, she said the company had been "nearly bankrupt" when she took over, devastated by the oil-price collapse. "Memories are short," she added.

However, according to interviews with 10 sources, including the four oil industry sources as well as officials from Sonangol and the government, Lourenço was frustrated with the slow pace of change at the company.

On Oct. 13, a week after meeting the oil majors and 17 days after taking office, the president ordered government ministers, Sonangol and international oil companies to form a 30-day working group to review the state of the industry.

The group's meetings, many of them led by new Secretary of State for Oil Carlos Saturnino, were tense, the sources said. Saturnino, an oil industry veteran, had been fired by dos Santos from his role as head of production and exploration at Sonangol last year when she accused him of gross mismanagement.

Even though dos Santos had launched a turnaround plan, huge hold-ups in the approval of projects were strangling the oil sector, according to the sources. Her board had implemented a system for checking projects submitted by foreign oil companies which in practice exacerbated the problem, they said.

She had also created a gulf between her board and the rest of the company by surrounding herself with foreign consultants, said the people, who declined to be named due to the confidential nature of the industry review and related discussions.

The working group concluded there was "a near paralysis" at Sonangol, according to a government source.

CHINA DEBTS

As the group assessed the state of the industry, Lourenço met with Sonangol's biggest lenders - including the Bank of China, Standard Bank and Standard Chartered - to understand Sonangol's financial situation and secure lower lending rates, according to a source familiar with the talks.

"Lourenço realised Sonangol needs money fast," said the source, adding that the company had been seeking to restructure some payments.

Standard Bank declined to comment, citing client confidentiality, while Standard Chartered and Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.

Sonangol's direct debt to Chinese banks and lending consortia including Chinese banks stood at $3.8 billion at the end of 2016, according to the company's annual report.

Oil industry sources told Reuters this debt now stood at about $3 billion, plus another $3 billion to majors, contractors and traders. Of that, nearly $1 billion is owed to trading firms Trafigura and Vitol under loans guaranteed by oil or product exports, according to a source close to Sonangol.

The government itself also last year took out a further $6.9 billion loan from the China Development Bank that it lent to Sonangol, $3.8 billion of which the firm used to refinance debt, according to an International Monetary Fund report.

Supporters of dos Santos, who are familiar with her work at Sonangol, said the debts dated back to before her tenure. They said the company was now in better financial state. The slow pace of restructuring, they say, was due to the scale of the job and restraints imposed by the state on selling assets.

Her dismissal, according to them, was purely political and part of a campaign by the president against her family.

'GOLDEN GOOSE'

With consensus in government building fast against dos Santos, she responded with a charm offensive.

In London, she met CEOs of major oil companies at an industry conference. On Oct. 18, she did a rare live interview at the Reuters office in the city's Canary Wharf financial district.

In the Reuters interview, she described her relationship with the new president as one of "full alignment". But she gave a hint that her days at Sonangol may be numbered, when asked if she would stay to see through the transformation of the firm.

"Once the foundations have been laid and are right, it doesn't matter who steps in as long as the plan is good," said dos Santos, who has stakes in businesses from telecoms to diamonds.

The charm offensive was too little, too late.

On Nov. 15, dos Santos and most of her board were sacked. She was replaced by the man that had become her nemesis: Saturnino.

Foundations notwithstanding, the new management faces the tasks of getting projects moving again, repaying billions of dollars owed to oil majors, contractors and traders, and servicing billions more dollars of debt owed to Chinese banks.

An executive at Sonangol said a massive round of lay-offs had been delayed until after the election and the task would also now most likely fall to the new team.

Lourenço, however, appeared confident of Sonangol's potential when he attended the board's inauguration on Oct. 16, describing the company as a "golden goose".

"Take good care of her," he said.

The bloggers published reports pointing to whistleblower allegations of fraud at MiMedx and what they claim are clues of government inquiries into MiMedx.

The company says the allegations are meritless, and that short sellers are sharing fake information in their campaign.

Petit's tactics may backfire, says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business: "Suing short sellers is unlikely to scare them away. It's more likely to attract more short sellers."



A flamboyant CEO critics call the "Trump of Georgia" is engaged in a legal war with the nation's short sellers — traders who bet a stock price will fall — and searching for the analysts who wrote anonymous blog posts about his small pharmaceutical company, MiMedx Group.

His name is Parker H. "Pete" Petit. He's a self-made millionaire with a university football field named after him and ties to high-level GOP officials.

Over the past few months, Petit has taken to conference calls and press releases to obsess over the idea that a "wolf pack" of "naked short sellers" is hell-bent on destroying his company. There's a section of the company's website dedicated to addressing claims and reports, and he's spending enough on legal fees that he had to acknowledge the rising expense to investors on the company's last earnings call. He wants to make sure his investors understand that short sellers have a vested interest in making his company look bad.

But of course that doesn't mean they're wrong.

One of the reports that set off this legal war was published on a site called Aurelius Value. It lists no author. It highlighted claims of "channel stuffing" — in this case, the practice of using distributors to artificially inflate sales — filed in a public whistleblower lawsuit last year. Another report, also anonymously authored, from a shop called Viceroy, suggested that the SEC is looking into the claims, something that's also claimed in another lawsuit against the company.

Not all critics of MiMedx remain anonymous, though. UBS, for example, told clients that the company's products — used to heal wounds — aren't as effective as the company says and face serious competition that investors aren't yet considering. UBS thinks the company is worth about 40% below its current stock price.

Regardless, it's the way Petit is hunting for the anonymous writers that has grabbed Wall Street's attention.

"It's unusual and it's dangerous because if you sue someone solely on the basis of finding someone else you could be countersued for abuse of process," said Erik Gordon, a lawyer turned professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "You can't sue people and put them at the expense of defending themselves in court when you have no basis for suing them other than that you're looking for someone."

Aurelius and Viceroy

Everything you read about Petit is larger than life.

He flies planes. He is friendly with Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. The Georgia State University football field was named for him after he gave a $10 million gift to the university to support the athletics program. He donated $3.3 million to Georgia Tech, his alma mater, for an engineering building. He was Donald Trump's finance chair in Georgia too.

His critics have tried to make something out of his ties to Price, who was overseeing the FDA for a few months this year. It's fairly standard political brawling that's not so relevant now that Price has been sent packing.

MiMedx turns human placenta into wound-healing treatment, and, according to Piper Jaffray, it enjoys the largest share of the wound-healing market in the US at 27% of sales. Its shares were breaking records until August.

Then the short sellers began to pile in — as indicated by the blue line in the chart below.

After that, Aurelius and Viceroy showed up. They're anonymous bloggers with an unknown readership. On September 20, Aurelius, whoever he or she is, wrote a blog post titled "MiMedx: Flying Too Close To The Sun."

Aurelius went over some issues at MiMedx — namely, allegations of channel stuffing levied against the company by two former employees. The allegations weren't new. They were made in a lawsuit filed against MiMedx last December.

Channel stuffing is when a company moves a bunch of its inventory around, parking it with some unit that investors don't even know exists, and then books that hidden inventory as a sale. The former employees, Jess Kruchoski and Luke Tornquist, allege that MiMedx was doing this through a now shuttered distributor called AvKare. Allegedly, AvKare would “provide sales documentation falsely documenting the bogus VA sales.”

That is, sales to hospitals belonging to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Sometimes, according to the suit, MiMedx wouldn't even use AvKare. MiMedx employees would simply ship their product, EpiFix, to VA hospitals around the country "without a purchase order from the VA or the VA even knowing about the shipment. In some cases, the shipments were even unbeknown to the representatives covering the accounts."

All this is public record, and was so for nine months before Aurelius's report. But Aurelius went a bit further:

But our research has also identified deep undisclosed entanglements between MiMedx and multiple other distributors.

Two of these distributors, CPM Medical and SLR Medical, are specifically identified in Florida court documents filed by one of MiMedx’s whistleblowers as having special undisclosed agreements along with an unidentified third having a “house account”.

The allegations (here) that MiMedx’s channel stuffing scheme extends significantly beyond the VA appear to have gone largely unnoticed by investors.

Viceroy's post — titled "MiMedx’s ... employment of kickback & bribery scheme inducers makes it uninvestable" — is pretty self-explanatory. In it, Viceroy claims evidence that the SEC may be conducting an investigation into MiMedx, something that has also been raised in legal filings.

Viceroy's evidence for this is that the SEC responded to a Freedom of Information Act request from Viceroy by claiming, as it's allowed to, that it doesn't have to release records that are being collected for "law enforcement" purposes or if the release could "interfere with enforcement proceedings."

Petit responded with a press release the very same day Aurelius published his or her report:

"The articles include several items that have virtually no basis in fact, are littered with innuendo and contain many statements that are simply not correct. This has all the markings of a concerted short seller attack by numerous entities attempting to short our stock and profit from fictitious information and innuendos."

"We believe that Viceroy Research and Aurelius Value are relying on misinformation from former MiMedx employees terminated for cause. Unfortunately, neither organization appears to have done adequate due diligence and fact-finding before publishing their so-called 'research reports.'"

Earlier in the year, he told Kaiser Health News that Kruchoski and Tornquist were "lying." He has also released letters written to one short seller in particular, in which he claims what the sellers are doing is unlawful and unethical.

There are a few parts to that claim. One is that they're releasing bad, even false, information into the market to manipulate the stock price. In particular, Petit claims that a letter from a MiMedx employee one short seller released is actually fake.

The other claim is that short sellers are doing what's called "naked short selling" — which is selling shares you don't own, without borrowing them from someone who does own them first. It is, in fact, illegal.

Sue. Them. All.

After all that, Petit began to sue a bunch of people, and that's when people on Wall Street took notice, because it's not every day a CEO sues a lineup of hedge funds and a media group to find two anonymous bloggers.

Now, before I continue, I need to make some disclosures. Within one of the press releases railing against a short seller named Marc Cohodes, MiMedx claimed I interviewed Cohodes at a conference (I did not, but I've published his ideas before).

In response to my questions about the allegations in the whistleblower suit, Petit declined to address any of the specifics and instead took to calling me a "shill" in a colorful letter that you can find at the end of this article. I do often speak to short sellers, and sometimes give air to their ideas when I think they're smart. I don't know who Aurelius and Viceroy are, though.

Neither does New York-based firm called Sparrow Fund Management, which was forced to respond to MiMedx's request for request for emergency discovery with a 30-page motion to dismiss that said, basically, "We're not Aurelius, and even if we were, Aurelius' speech is protected under the First Amendment."

From the motion:

The crux of MiMedx’s complaint targets a variety of statements made by named and unnamed defendants—none of which is actually Sparrow—conveying opinions about MiMedx and discussing various widely disseminated public reports.

But as Sparrow has repeatedly informed MiMedx since the filing of this lawsuit, including by sworn affidavit, MiMedx’s claims against Sparrow are wrongly premised on a simple yet dispositive defect: Sparrow is not behind the anonymous blogger “Aurelius Value.” That being the case, and with no factual allegations to support any connection between Sparrow and “Aurelius Value,” MiMedx’s case against Sparrow evaporates at the pleading stage.

MiMedx's lawsuit against investigative media outlet The Capitol Forum (TCF) is a bit different.

TCF is a DC media outfit known for its deep dives into potentially fraudulent companies. In August, it published a note on the channel-stuffing allegations against MiMedx. Then in September, after Aurelius and Viceroy published their pieces, Capitol Forum published the government's response to an FOIA request it filed requesting information on MiMedx and the VA.

The government responded, saying, “The records you requested are part of an ongoing law enforcement investigation and are not releasable at this time.”

MiMedx issued a press release in September saying that it was aware of a VA investigation but that it was not the target and said it had told The Capitol Forum as much.

"To the extent there has been any innuendo by The Capitol Forum or others that somehow MiMedx is a target, that is simply incorrect based on available information," the release says.

Anyway, now MiMedx is suing The Capitol Forum for libel — not in its story, but in an email to potential subscribers.

"Defendants' conduct herein, and specifically, the false and malicious statement in the August 21, 2017 e-mail concerning Defendants' article of the same day and allegations of wrongful conduct against MiMedx by "customers," constituted actionable libel," says MiMedx's complaint.

'Parker the Barker'

Again, I probably wouldn't know any of this if it weren't for Cohodes, a particularly loud short seller who lives on a California chicken farm. Cohodes is one of the most infamous short sellers on Wall Street, known for bombastic language and RSVP'ing "will attend" to any fight he's invited to. He got wind of what was going on at MiMedx and started a site called PetiteParkerTheBarker.com, which documents Petit's "bullying."

On the site you can also view Cohodes' presentation at Grant's Interest Rate Observer Conference. MiMedx says I interviewed Cohodes at that conference where he said:

“I always say bet the jockey not the horse. So I look for inept and/or dishonest management who has a track record of running companies into the ground. Telling a lie or two along the way also helps. I also look for balance sheet stress and financial engineering to make the business look stronger than it truly is.”

The thing is, I wasn't at Grant's this year. And that quote is from an interview I did with Cohodes last year about two completely unrelated stocks.

So I was compelled to make some calls — including one to Sen. Isakson's office. His representative said the senator was in no way involved with a VA investigation into MiMedx, since the VA investigative unit is totally independent. His office had, however, put Petit in touch with the VA at Petit's request — something it would do for any constituent.

I also dug through the legal filings and sent a bunch of pointed questions to Petit regarding the lawsuits, the whistleblower allegations, UBS' research, and his relationships with powerful politicians.

Here's a smattering of what I sent:

Can the company say on the record that Aurelius, Viceroy, or Capitol Forum make false statements about the company? Which statements are false?

Can MDXG confirm that it is not under investigation by federal authorities, including the SEC as well as the VA Office of the Inspector General?

Can the company comment on UBS research that suggests its products have a lower efficacy rate than the 90% rate the company claims?

In one of your public disclosures, you say that I interviewed Marc Cohodes at a Grant's Interest Rate Observer Conference. I did not, and have never interviewed Cohodes publicly. Where did you get your information?

I knew we weren't going to have frank discussion when I read the first sentence of Petit's response. "First your statement that you never wrote an article about Marc Cohodes is incorrect," it said. He's right, I had written about Cohodes — but that wasn't my question.

You can read the full letter below, but here's the meaty part.

"Now I read your questions. It appears to me they have all come directly from Marc Cohodes, Aurelius, Viceroy, or others who are seeking to bring down MiMedx's stock price to gain a financial advantage for themselves. Therefore, if you publish an article addressing these questions, you are going to be acting as their "Shill". Indeed, some of your questions seemed to be aimed at obtaining information from MiMedx for this group to use in their pending litigation."

Petit suggested that I discuss this with an attorney, which I have done.

"He can call himself the Donald Trump of Georgia or the Kim Kardashian of Atlanta — anything he wants ... if you drag people into court with no basis you should expect trouble and you deserve trouble," said Gordon, who has also taught at the University of Michigan's law school.

"Short sellers lead a precarious life," he added. "What scares short sellers away is evidence that the short is going to bite them, but suing short sellers is unlikely to scare them away. It's more likely to attract more short sellers."

Well, after Cohodes and Capital Forum got involved, Citron Research, helmed by short seller Andrew Left, put out a YouTube video on the channel-stuffing allegations against the company.

A third former MiMedx employee filed a retaliation claim against the company. His name is Michael Fox, and he was a supervisor for the two first whistleblowers. He says that after they filed their claim, he refused to engage in MiMedx's fraudulent scheme. He says he went to the SEC and that the SEC then subpoenaed MiMedx. After that MiMedx withheld his wages and sued him.

MiMedx's stock has fallen 27% in less than three months.

During an earnings call, Virtu CEO Doug Cifu said the firm brought its headcount down from a combined 1,250 between the two firms to 648. He also suggested that KCG had been poorly run.



Cifu said the merger is going better than expected.



The writing was on the wall from the beginning.

When Virtu Financial — which had grown to become one of the largest high-speed trading firms in less than a decade — acquired rival KCG in July, there was an understanding that costs and staff were going to be cut fast. Virtu had spent $1.4 billion on its purchase and was already known for a lean business model. Virtu had just 150 staff, compared with 1,100 at KCG. That's to say nothing of KCG's old-fashioned flash with cash reputation.

So there were some easy targets for Virtu chief executive Doug Cifu. Still, the speed and success of Virtu's integration of KCG caught Wall Street off guard this week. After the company reported results for the first time since the purchase closed, the stock soared more than 18%.

The firm posted a net loss of $40 million, due to costs associated with the deal, with revenues of $271.3 million (up 64.6% year-on-year) offset by operating expenses of $317.8 million. But the firm guided to fourth quarter operating expenses of $152 million, with full year 2018 guidance at $503 million. The firm also said it generated $3.1 million in adjusted net trading income per day for August, September and October, and that that figure could grow to as much as $3.6 million per day in time.

And in an earnings call to discuss the results, Cifu said KCG's technology was a mess, it lacked discipline around capital allocation, had multiple unprofitable units, and missed opportunities to expand in areas of strength.

"Harmonize the strengths of both legacy firms"

The ultimate vision of the acquisition, to "harmonize the strengths of both legacy firms," has not changed since the deal closed in July, Cifu said. The backdrop looks the same as well. High-frequency traders continue to struggle amid an environment of low volatility in which the big price swings that traders profit from are harder to come by.

Cifu, however, says the newly combined company is even more optimistic about the merger than it was when the deal was first announced in April.



Since the deal closed, Virtu has done the following:

Cut staff: Virtu had cut staff almost in half from 1250 total employees (1,100 from KCG and 150 from Virtu) to just 648.

Virtu had cut staff almost in half from 1250 total employees (1,100 from KCG and 150 from Virtu) to just 648. Sold assets: Virtu has sold off KCG's $400 million bond business to ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, with the proceeds being used to pay down debt.

Integrated tech: "We are moving to a single pan-asset, class, and geography integrated technology platform," Cifu said. "From an operational and trading perspective, the legacy Getco and Knight systems were essentially unaware of each other." KCG was formed when two trading firms, Knight and Getco, merged in 2013. According to Cifu the merger translated into redundancies four years later.

Made changes in Asia: "KCG's Singapore and Mumbai offices had 29 employees and generated little to no revenue," Cifu said, adding that Virtu had addressed this issue.

Shut a unit: GQS, a quantitative proprietary trading unit at KCG that posted a loss in the first quarter and a small gain in the second, has been shut down.

GQS, a quantitative proprietary trading unit at KCG that posted a loss in the first quarter and a small gain in the second, has been shut down. Taken KCG quant strategies global: "We knew this from due diligence that they candidly had not done a great job taking these quantitative strategies in equities and in futures and in other asset classes around the globe," Cifu said. Virtu rolled these out to Canada, and is now rolling out those strategies to 34 more countries.

Virtu rolled these out to Canada, and is now rolling out those strategies to 34 more countries. Capital is now deployed with more discipline. "There were just a number of instances around the firm [KCG] where capital was being deployed very, very inefficiently," Cifu said.

Cifu said he expects Virtu will achieve $262 million in gross synergies in 2018, adding that headcount reductions the firm has undertaken will have little impact on revenues.

"As we have previously noted many of the departed employees worked in redundant cost centers or offices that generated little to no revenue, or even lost money trading," Cifu said.

It's working on dozens of new projects



It's not just a question of cutting costs. Cifu also mentioned a "dozens" of new projects underway at the firm that have emerged from collaborations between Virtu and KCG. The company has "generated approximately $14 million of incremental annualized adjusted net-trading income from these growth initiatives alone," according to Cifu.

He added that "the size and scoop of these initiatives is many multiples of what has been achieved to date."

All this has been achieved in a period of historically low volatility, Cifu said, adding that he's "really excited about when - not if but when - volatility comes back." He said:

"When you have a firm that has its fixed cost base under control, and I think we put our money where our mouth is today, and you have a firm that can demonstrably generate net trading revenue in muted volatility environment, you have a great model. And the model is, in a famine, we can generate significant returns and then the model scales exceptionally well. That's always been the model of legacy Virtu, and it's the model of the combined firm going forward."http://www.businessinsider.com/paul-singers-elliott-hedge-fund-says-markets-are-facing-risks-2017-11$34 billion hedge fund Elliott Management declares all the ingredients for a crash are there-5Elliott Management, one of the world's largest hedge funds, with $34 billion, told clients the ingredients for a market crash were all in place.

The hedge fund was founded by billionaire Paul Singer, a big GOP donor.

The firm has been prepping for a significant market event — raising $5 billion in about 24 hours earlier this year.



"Markets are in a kind of dreamland."

That's according to Elliott Management, which manages $34 billion and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. The firm, led by billionaire GOP donor and hedge fund manager Paul Singer, says markets are at high risk, partially because of super-low interest rates, according to a third-quarter client letter seen by Business Insider.

The stock market has been raging, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs.

"The current 'stability' is not sustainable," Elliott wrote. "Monetary policy has been extraordinary, and the end of this period of its policy ascendancy and the consequent levitation of asset prices, whenever it occurs, will likely be commensurately extraordinary."

Elliott says it doesn't know when markets will turn, and to be sure, the firm has been warning about some kind of market chaos for some time. Earlier this year, the hedge fund raised $5 billion in about 24 hours from investors to put money to work, expecting "all hell to break loose."

In the most recent letter, Elliott laid out the "historical recipe for a crash":

"ominously overpriced assets financed by too much debt;

"a tightly wound matrix of highly leveraged trading positions;

"technical or situational accelerants (in 1987, 'portfolio insurance; today, all kinds of negative gamma strategies, the false liquidity of ETFs, volatility selling, massive leveraged bond ownership at the highest price for duration in history, financial institution balance sheets that remain completely opaque and highly leveraged)."

Elliott said (emphasis added):

"This kind of history is not a blueprint, and certainly many of these 'recipe' elements appeared well before 2017. But we think history is NOT bunk, and that markets are in a kind of dreamland. If and when they wake up, investors and traders may not like what they see. It is not far fetched to imagine the widespread and tightly-held assumptions of millions of investors being smashed like pumpkins in a future (actually, 'back to the future') environment."

Elliott also pointed out specific concerns for the bond markets:

"If economic growth, appearing to tilt ever-so-slightly upward now in Japan and Europe, and growing steadily but slowly in the U.S., actually accelerates even a modest amount, if demand for commodities increases, and if such environment causes wages and prices to rise, one could envision a severely negative impact on global bond markets."

Elliott managed $34.1 billion as of October 1, the letter said.

The firm is barely beating competitors in performance this year through the end of September. The Elliott Associates LP fund is up 6.8% after fees, and the Elliott International Limited fund is up 6% after fees this year through the third quarter, according to a client note reviewed by Business Insider.http://www.businessinsider.com/mary-claire-king-and-the-impact-brca-genes-had-on-cancer-genetics-2017-11Over a 40-year career, this 'stubborn scientist' helped change the way we think about cancer and genetics7Mary-Claire King, a geneticist and professor at the University of Washington, was instrumental in the discovery that changed the way we think about cancer.

Her work with the BRCA1 gene that's associated with breast and ovarian cancer came after decades of research during her more than 40-year career.

In the past few years, the impact of her work has started to be felt by the world as cancer genetic testing becomes more widespread.

You might not know the name Mary-Claire King, but you probably know the result of this scientist's most famous work: the BRCA1 gene that's been critical in fighting breast and ovarian cancer.

A geneticist at the University of Washington, King has spent her 40-year career working to better understand human genetics, especially the codes that make up all of us. Her discoveries helped open entire areas of medicine. But it wasn't until the past few years that the effects of her work started to be widely recognized publicly, sparked in part by actor Angelina Jolie's revelation that she had the "faulty" BRCA1 gene, increasing her risk of cancer.

In 2014, King received a prestigious Lasker award for her work in breast cancer genetics as well as human rights, and in 2016 President Barack Obama acknowledged her work with the the National Medal of Science.

"At a time when most scientists believed that cancer was caused by viruses, she relentlessly pursued her hunch that certain cancers were linked to inherited genetic mutations," Obama said at the ceremony. "This self-described 'stubborn' scientist kept going until she proved herself right."

King's initial work in genetics for her doctoral thesis in 1975 was the discovery that humans and chimpanzees are 99% genetically similar. Later, she analyzed DNA from grandmothers to help reconnect them with their grandchildren who had been kidnapped as part of Argentina's "dirty war." She was also active during the Civil Rights Movement.

"As a scientist, one is a citizen of the world. And as a citizen of the world, you have certain responsibilities" King said of her activism in an interview with the World Science Festival.

Arguably, King's biggest impact resulted from her work pinpointing BRCA1, a gene that's critical in producing proteins that repair damaged DNA.

What we know now, based in part on King's research, is that mutations in the BRCA gene have big implications for a person's cancer risk. The risk of getting breast cancer goes from 7% to an average of 55-65% when you have the BRCA1 or 2 gene mutation, while for ovarian cancer the risk increases from 1% to 30%. Knowing you have one of these genetic tweaks, then, could help doctors make more proactive decisions to treat.

Discovering the genetics of cancer

Back when King started her work in the 1970s, the link between cancer and genetics hadn't been made. The running theory at the time was that cancer was viral.

"I thought genetics, evolutionary biology and statistics might add something to the newly launched War on Cancer. And my closest childhood friend had died of cancer. I wanted to try," she told The New York Times in 2015.

Getting a chance to start that research wasn't easy either. On the week leading up to King getting a grant for her research back in April 1981, her husband left her, her house was burgled, and she had a chance encounter with baseball legend Joe DiMaggio.

Here's her re-telling of the week leading up to her presentation at the National Institutes of Health, which led to the grant.

Finally, after years of figuring out just how genetics and family histories of cancer played a role in cancer risk, in 1990, King found the gene linked to breast cancer and named it BRCA1. After that, there was a race to see who could clone the gene, a move which helped researchers better understand how mutations in the gene led to cancer.

Now, doctors are able to give tests to their patients who might have a family history of cancer, to see if they might be at an increased risk based on BRCA and other mutations that have since been linked to various forms of cancer.

A lasting impact

Color CEO Othman Laraki told Business Insider that King is someone who has a "North Pole," which helps her look at data with clear logic. Color sells hereditary cancer — including BRCA1 and 2 and high cholesterol tests — and works with King, who serves as a collaborator and adviser to the company. Working with her, Laraki said, made sense because of her history in working to establish the connection between cancer and genetics, but also to bring that connection to people.

"She’s one of the people who bridge scientific discovery and the knowledge that enables entire populations," Laraki said.

And that's starting to get even more widespread, especially after a 2013 Supreme Court decision ended the ability to have a patent on the BRCA gene, along with Jolie's diagnosis that spread the word about the gene.

"Mary-Claire King, she's invented something that's almost as relevant a datapoint as your blood pressure," said Feyi Olopade Ayodele, CEO of CancerIQ, a company that builds software to help doctors better understand and access hereditary cancer genetics tests at the preventative level. " That's how impactful genetic testing will be in the future."http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-supplier-foxconn-to-stop-using-illegal-intern-labour-on-iphone-x-2017-11Apple supplier Foxconn says it will stop using illegal intern labour to assemble the iPhone X5The Apple supplier Foxconn has admitted to using illegal intern labour to assemble the iPhone X.

Students said they worked 11-hour days, which is a breach of Chinese labour law.

The scandal comes after Apple reportedly faced delays in getting the iPhone X to customers.



The Apple supplier Foxconn has said it will stop using illegal intern labour in its factories that are used to assemble technology products for some of the world's biggest companies, according to a report by BBC News.

Foxconn's use of interns on its production lines was first reported by the Financial Times. Six students told the newspaper that they regularly worked 11-hour shifts assembling Apple's new iPhone X, which is a breach of Chinese labour law. The Financial Times said a group of 3,000 interns worked in Foxconn's factories.

The students, who were reportedly ages 17 to 19, told the Financial Times that their work at Foxconn was work experience that they had to do to complete their education.

Now, Foxconn has told BBC News it has ended its practice of letting interns work overtime. The company reportedly said it took "immediate action to ensure that no interns are carrying out any overtime work," and it said interns represented "a very small percentage" of its overall workforce.

Apple told BBC News it was "dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve." It continued: "We know our work is never done and we'll continue to do all we can to make a positive impact and protect workers in our supply chain."

It's an embarrassing story for Apple, which has regularly faced criticism over the supply chain of its products. Apple had to ask the Chinese mining company Huayou to stop using child labour after Sky News found it was using children as young as 4 to mine for the material.

Foxconn has faced its own issues in the past: In 2010 a series of employees died in suicides after working long hours in the factory, which eventually led the company to erect suicide nets on its buildings designed to prevent future deaths.

The iPhone X faced production problems

The KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo covers Apple's supply chain in Asia and regularly covered delays with the iPhone X. He said Apple faced shortages on key components of the device, which meant it struggled to get the phones it needed ready for when it went on sale.

Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about the potential of delays to the iPhone X in an interview with BuzzFeed. The executive gave a rather diplomatic answer: "We'll see what happens, but we'll be working as hard as possible to make as many as possible."http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-mueller-michael-flynn-russia-investigation-lobbying-turkey-2017-11Mueller is zeroing in on Michael Flynn3Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation, is looking into Bijan Kian, a former business associate of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Mueller is primarily interested in gauging what role Kian played in Flynn Intel Group's lobbying activity for a Turkish businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Flynn has come under scrutiny because of his contacts with Russian officials and his work as a foreign agent, and recent revelations could mean Mueller sees Flynn as his next target.



Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation, is looking into an associate of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, NBC News reported Wednesday, in a likely sign that the inquiry is steering toward Flynn's activities.

Mueller is tasked with looking into Russia's interference in the 2016 election as well as whether any members of President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor.

When it comes to Flynn, Mueller is focused mainly on his work as a foreign agent and his lobbying activities, throughout the latter half of 2016, for a businessman with ties to the Turkish government.

Flynn was paid $530,000 last year by the businessman, Ekim Alptekin, who is a member of a Turkish economic-relations board run by an appointee of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Alptekin is also the head of Inovo, a consulting firm.

Flynn's firm was tasked with fomenting dissent inside Turkey and with lobbying the US government to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup.

Flynn Intel Group was required, under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, to register as a foreign agent as soon as it secured the contract with Inovo, but it did not do so until months later. It acknowledged in a filing that its work could have "principally benefited" Turkey.

The latest focus for Mueller, NBC News reported Wednesday, is Bijan Kian, a former business partner of Flynn's. Mueller is reportedly seeking to gauge what role, if any, Kian played in securing the Inovo contract for Flynn Intel Group. The special counsel's office also wants to know whether Kian has any information about other lobbying efforts the firm may have undertaken that have not yet been disclosed, NBC News said.

Sources told NBC News that prosecutors were also interested in a September 20, 2016, meeting between Kian, Flynn, and the pro-Russia congressman Dana Rohrabacher.

Mueller turns up the heat on Flynn

The Russia investigation has ramped up in recent weeks, particularly after a federal grand jury indicted Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and one of his associates, Rick Gates, in October on 12 counts related to money laundering, financial crimes, and their work as foreign agents.

Since then, multiple media reports have suggested that Mueller is zeroing in on Flynn, who legal experts have said could be increasingly vulnerable in the Russia investigation.

Mueller's team subpoenaed the lobbying firm SGR LLC in August after Flynn Intel Group hired the firm ostensibly to "promote a good business climate in Turkey," The Washington Post reported. Flynn's firm hired SGR as part of its work with Inovo.

Though Flynn Intel Group's initial stated goal in hiring SGR was to foster a stronger business climate in Turkey, it was later forced to indicate that it brought SGR on to "raise concerns" to the US about Gulen.

At the beginning of November, NBC News reported that Mueller had enough evidence to indict Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr.

A former business associate of Flynn's said the younger Flynn had a prominent role in Flynn Intel Group's day-to-day operations and served as his father's chief of staff, and Mueller could be turning up the heat on the younger Flynn to prompt his father's cooperation in the investigation. CNN also reported that Flynn and his wife, Lori, were worried their son could get caught in the crosshairs of the investigation.

It's unclear who the source of the NBC News report about a possible Flynn indictment was, but legal experts floated the possibility that the leak came from Flynn's defense team, which could have been using it in an effort to secure a pardon from Trump.

Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white-collar defense attorney at Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C., said earlier this month that the younger Flynn's aggressive social-media campaign against Mueller and the Russia investigation suggested that he refused to flip and was hoping for a presidential pardon. Cotter also pointed to Trump's apparent loyalty to Flynn, who was one of his most prominent campaign surrogates before becoming national security adviser.

"The president of the United States, who has virtually unlimited pardon power, has gone on the record, in public, and said he doesn't think Flynn should be prosecuted," Cotter said.

"If you're Flynn's attorney, the possibility of a pardon is something you'd think about," he added. "It's an amazing thing to have the president, before your client is charged, saying publicly that he doesn't think they should even be investigated, much less charged."

Flynn was forced to resign in February when it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the US, during the transition period. Three weeks earlier, Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, warned the White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail over his conversations with Kislyak.

Trump also ignored advice during the transition period from President Barack Obama, who fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, to steer clear of Flynn.

The FBI was already investigating Flynn when he resigned. He informed the Trump transition team in January, before the inauguration, that he was the subject of a separate FBI investigation related to his lobbying work for Turkey. He joined the administration as national security adviser shortly after.

Flynn's activities came up in a February conversation between Trump and the FBI director at the time, James Comey. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June that soon after Flynn resigned, Trump approached him and asked him to "let this go," referring to the bureau's investigation into the former national security adviser. Comey said he refused to assure Trump that the FBI would do so.

Trump fired Comey in May, later citing "this Russia thing" as a factor in his decision.http://www.businessinsider.com/theres-a-high-chance-that-ubers-failure-to-disclose-its-hack-was-illegal-2017-11There's a 'high chance' that Uber's failure to disclose its hack was illegal-3Uber on Tuesday revealed that it had covered up a data breach that took place in 2016, affecting 57 million users.

The company failed to tell authorities around the world and, according to Bloomberg, paid $100,000 to the hackers to cover up the breach, which included names, emails, and phone numbers.

UK authorities have said British users were affected but haven't said how many.

The UK's digital minister, Matt Hancock, said the company probably broke the law — the most damning statement yet from the government.



The questions are piling up on Uber about a data breach that put at least 57 million users at risk but wasn't disclosed by the company.

The ride-hailing company is now under investigation in the US, the UK, and other countries for failing to disclose the hack to authorities and apparently paying hackers to cover up the breach.

Now the UK's digital minister, Matt Hancock, has given the most damning official statement yet on the breach by suggesting the company broke the law by failing to disclose.

Hancock made the comments in Parliament on Thursday. Asked by Labour MP Kevin Brennan whether Uber had broken the law in relation to the breach, Hancock responded that Brennan "asked whether this is illegal under current UK law — that of course is matter for the courts, but I think there's a very high chance that it is."

Neither Hancock nor Brennan went into further detail.

Uber did not specifically respond to Hancock's comments but said in a statement: "We are in the process of notifying various regulatory and government authorities and we expect to have ongoing discussions with them. Until we complete that process we aren't in a position to get into any more details."

Hancock added that it's an "aggravating factor" if a company gets hacked but doesn't tell authorities immediately. That can potentially lead to higher fines, though in the case of the UK's data authority, that's only a maximum of £500,000, or $665,000. Bloomberg on Tuesday reported that Uber had paid the attackers a $100,000 ransom.

"Delaying notification is not acceptable," Hancock said.

The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, has already said it will investigate the breach.

We still don't know how many British users were affected

The ICO has confirmed British users were affected by the hack but hasn't yet given an estimate on how many.

According to Hancock, Uber has handed over information on how many of its UK users were affected by the hack.

But he said the government didn't fully trust the figures.

He said: "In terms of the number, we do not have sufficient confidence in the number we have been told by Uber to go public. We're working with the [National Cyber Security Centre] to have more confidence in that figure."

Hancock pointed out that the number of customers affected by the hack on the US consumer-data giant Equifax turned out to be bigger than originally estimated. The government says it plans to publish its findings in "a matter of days."

It also turns out that the government found out about the hack only from media reports on Tuesday, with Uber giving statements to the press before speaking with UK authorities, Hancock said.

"Uber had failed to tell the UK authorities before they spoke to the media," he said.

"As far as we can tell, it was not a hack perpetrated in the UK. Our role is therefore to at this stage is to understand how UK citizens were affected. We are working with the ICO and the NCSC, and they are talking to the [Federal Trade Commission] and others to get to the bottom of this."

Hancock added that it seemed unlikely that any of the stolen information could be used to steal customers' money.

"At this stage, our initial assessment for Uber customers ... the stolen information is not the sort of information that would allow direct financial crime."http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-time-travel-with-wormholes-2017-11There are 2 types of time travel and physicists agree that one of them is possible7Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.

Brian Greene: I’m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.

It's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.

We know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.

He also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.

This is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.

The main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.

It's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.

Now again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.http://www.businessinsider.com/joe-barton-nude-photo-leak-revenge-porn-police-investigation-2017-11Capitol Police are reportedly investigating leaked nude photo of a Texas GOP lawmaker-5A sexually explicit image of Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas surfaced on the internet on Tuesday.

Barton says the Capitol Hill police are investigating.

Barton reportedly once warned a woman that he would contact the police if she didn't stop communicating with other women he was previously romantically involved with.



The Washington Post on Wednesday said it had reviewed a 2015 recording of Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas warning a woman who received "inappropriate photographs and videos" of him that he might report the matter to the Capitol Hill police. An anonymous Twitter account published a lewd photo photo of Barton on Tuesday.

In a recording of the call, The Post said, Barton confronted the woman after she was discovered to have communicated with other women who were romantically involved with Barton. The woman is also believed to have forwarded explicit materials from Barton to the other women.

"I want your word that this ends," Barton said in the recording, according to The Post. "I will be completely straight with you. I am ready if I have to, I don't want to, but I should take all this crap to the Capitol Hill Police and have them launch an investigation. And if I do that, that hurts me potentially big time."

Barton reportedly continued, saying he would detail all of their exchanges to the police, including material he said he did not want to be publicly disclosed.

"You still apparently had all of those and were in position to use them in a way that would negatively affect my career," Barton reportedly said.

If the woman shared explicit images of Barton, that may violate Texas laws prohibiting "revenge porn," in which people publicize such material without consent as a form of retaliation, The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday. Violators could face a year in jail and up to a $4,000 fine.

On Wednesday, Barton said in a statement that the Capitol Police would launch an investigation into the incident. The Capitol Police could not be reached by Business Insider for comment Wednesday evening.

"When I ended that relationship, she threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation," Barton said, according to The Post.

The woman said she was in contact with Barton for five years, beginning in 2011, after she published a message on his Facebook page, according to The Post. Among the sexually explicit material he sent the woman was reportedly a video of him masturbating, which The Post said appeared to be the source of the photo released on Twitter on Tuesday. The woman interviewed by The Post said she did not publish the photo.

Barton, who said the two had a consensual relationship, was still married when they became romantically involved, according to The Post.http://www.businessinsider.com/r-search-for-missing-argentine-submarine-reaches-critical-phase-2017-11There's been no contact with a missing Argentine submarine, and the search is entering a 'critical phase'-7The search for an Argentine navy submarine missing in the South Atlantic for one week reached a "critical phase" on Wednesday as the 44 crew members on board could be running low on oxygen, an Argentine navy spokesman said.

Favorable weather on Wednesday meant boats could cover a greater area after being hampered by strong winds and high waves over the past few days, though poor weather was expected to return on Thursday, a navy spokesman named Enrique Balbi said.

If the San Juan, a German-built submarine, had sunk or was otherwise unable to rise to the surface since it gave its location on November 15, it would be using up the last of its seven-day oxygen supply. Officials say the sub could be stranded as deep as 600 feet.

"We are in the critical phase ... particularly with respect to oxygen," Balbi told reporters, according to Reuters. "There has been no contact with anything that could be the San Juan submarine."

While the sub's crew has enough food, oxygen, and fuel to survive 90 days on the surface, Argentina's navy has said there's only enough oxygen to survive seven days while submerged. Other experts said that if the sub sank but remained intact, its oxygen could last seven to 10 days, but that amount would depend on when the sub last surfaced to recharge its batteries and other factors.

About 30 boats and planes and 4,000 people from Argentina, the US, the UK, Chile, and Brazil have joined the search for the submarine, which last transmitted its location about 300 miles from the coast.

Balbi said the search effort had been narrowed to a 12-mile-by-12-mile area. Planes have covered some 190,000 square miles of the ocean surface, but much of the area has not yet been scoured by the boats.

Several possible signals, including sounds and flares, that have been detected have turned out to be false alarms. Seven low-frequency satellite signals picked up on Saturday were also found to have not come from the sub. Argentina's navy said on Tuesday that white flares and an empty raft that had been spotted did not come from the San Juan.

Overnight on Tuesday, a British ship reported observing three orange and white flares, but they did not come from the vessel, Balbi said.

The San Juan was en route from the Argentine port in Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, to the coastal city of Mar del Plata, some 250 miles south of Buenos Aires. Argentina navy Cmdr. Gabriel Galeazzi said the sub surfaced to report the problem — which he described as a "short circuit" in its batteries — on the morning of November 15.

The sub was immediately ordered to return to port, according to the BBC. Balbi said the San Juan's captain contacted the naval base again, saying the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and head to the Mar del Plata naval base.

The last contact was made at 7:30 a.m. local time. Argentine subs are required to contact their bases twice a day during peacetime. The search began after it failed to report.

The San Juan, a TR-1700-class diesel-electric submarine, was built in Germany in 1983 for Argentina and commissioned in 1985. It underwent maintenance in Argentina in 2008 and a $12 million refit in 2014, which required cutting the sub in half to replace its engines and batteries.

Such refits can be difficult because they involve integrating systems built by different manufacturers, according to Rockford Weitz, the director of the Fletcher School's maritime-studies program at Tufts University.

"The cost of even the smallest mistake during this cutting phase of the operation is enormous — threatening the life and safety of the ship's crew," Weitz told The Associated Press.

What makes the San Juan so effective as a submarine may also be foiling efforts to find it. The stealthy vessel is very quiet underwater and produces few detectable emissions, especially if some of its systems are disabled. An anti-submarine-warfare expert and former US Navy submariner told The Aviationist that locating the boat would be "like trying to find a hole in the water."

The weather has also hindered search efforts. Waves more than 20 feet high have made it harder for surface vessels and planes to spot anything on the ocean's surface. Rough conditions would also make it difficult for the sub to take in new air if it's still on the surface.

The US Navy has sent two P-8A Poseidon planes, the service's most advanced anti-submarine surveillance aircraft, as well as several unmanned underwater vehicles capable of scanning broad swaths of the seafloor (though the seafloor itself may make it hard to find the sub if it's there). A NASA research aircraft flew over the area but didn't spot anything.

US submarine-rescue assets — including the Submarine Rescue Chamber that can rescue six people at a time while reaching depths of 850 feet — have also been redeployed to the area by the US Air Force. The San Juan has a hatch that can couple with a US rescue ship.

The UK's elite Submarine Parachute Assistance Group — made up of specially trained medics, engineers, and undersea escape specialists — has also reportedly joined the search. (Argentina bought the sub in response to its defeat by the UK in the 1982 Falklands War, and Britain joining the search is seen by some as a positive step in their relations.)

Relatives of the crew members have been gathered at the Mar del Plata base, where the search is being coordinated. Argentine authorities and some crew members' families have tried to remain optimistic as the search has dragged on.

But the families of the crew, which includes Argentina's first woman submarine officer, have grown increasingly distressed as experts say the sub's oxygen supply may be dwindling.

"We came today because we had hope that they had returned," Elena Alfaro, the sister of a crew member and radar expert named Cristian Ibanez, told Reuters on Wednesday in tears. "It is incomprehensible that so much time has passed. We are in pain."

Peter Thiel financed wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, eventually forcing it into a 2016 bankruptcy and a fire sale to Univision.

If Thiel ends up being allowed to bid on Gawker.com and wins the auction, he would get the site's archives, branding, and social media accounts.

It looks like controversial billionaire Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member and Donald Trump's biggest supporter in Silicon Valley, might be interested in buying Gawker.com — the news site he helped force into bankruptcy.

In October 2017, the The Wall Street Journal reported that Gawker bankruptcy plan administrators were looking to sell the Gawker.com domain, and were searching for buyers.

The problem, it seems, is that Thiel's lawyers believe he's being unfairly excluded from the bidding process, and that the sale should be paused until the matter is resolved. This is according to a bankruptcy court filing made on Wednesday by Thiel's lawyers, which was reviewed by BuzzFeed News.

This objection would seem to signal that Thiel is interested in bidding on Gawker.com and its assets, which would include its archive of articles, its branding, and its social media accounts. Any potential owner would be free to delete the Gawker.com archives.

Representatives for Thiel and the Gawker bankruptcy plan administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The case

Hulk Hogan, the wrestler whose real name is Terry Bollea, was awarded $140 million in damages in March 2016 stemming from a Gawker news article published in 2012 that included footage of him having sex. It was later revealed that Thiel had secretly financed the lawsuit and others against Gawker Media.

"I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest," Thiel, whom Gawker publicly outed as gay in 2007, told The New York Times in May 2016. In a speech, Thiel once described Gawker as a "singular, sociopathic bully."

To protect its assets from being collected by Hogan, Gawker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its assets were then sold to Univision in a government-ordered auction in August 2016, which bought them for $135 million.

Univision shut down operations of Gawker.com, the company's flagship site, but has continued to run its other properties, which consist of Gizmodo, Lifehacker, Deadspin, Jezebel, Kotaku, and Jalopnik. The Gawker archives remain available online.http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-organization-exits-trump-soho-hotel-2017-11The Trumps are cutting ties with the five-star Trump SoHo hotel after business plummeted post-election-3The Trump Organization is cutting ties with Trump SoHo.

The upscale hotel has struggled to fill rooms and bring in guests following the election.

A restaurant in the hotel closed earlier this year after "the Kardashians stopped coming" post-election.

Trump SoHo — the Trump Organization-run, five-star Downtown Manhattan hotel — will no longer carry the Trump name or be affiliated with the family.

On Wednesday, the Trump Organization reached a deal to allow the company to cut ties with the property, The New York Times reported.

According to The Times, the hotel has struggled to fill rooms and sell condominiums as President Donald Trump has risen in political prominence.

Koi, a restaurant located in the hotel, closed earlier this year after a reported drop in business following Trump's win in the 2016 election.

"Before Trump won we were doing great. There were a lot of people we had, our regulars, who'd go to the hotel but are not affiliated with Trump," Jonathan Grullon, a busser and host at the restaurant, told New York Magazine's GrubStreet. "And they were saying if he wins, we are not coming here anymore."

Another restaurant worker told GrubStreet that, following the election, "the Kardashians stopped coming" — and business plummeted. While Suzanne Chou, Koi Group's general counsel, "declined to speculate" why business declined, she said that "obviously since the election it's gone down."

A new restaurant called Spring & Varick recently opened in the space that formerly belonged to Koi.

Earlier this year, WNYC reported the five-star hotel was planning to lay off workers and reduce some of its services.

The hotel will continue to be owned by CIM, an investment firm in California. Now, however, the Trump Organization will no longer manage day-to-day operations or brand the hotel under the Trump name.

In 2010, the Major Economic Crimes Bureau of the Manhattan District Attorney's office opened an investigation into Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. for reportedly misleading buyers in the Trump SoHo project. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. dropped the case after receiving a donation from the Trump Organization's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, as ProPublica reported in October.http://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-thanksgiving-recipes-2016-11The most Googled Thanksgiving recipe in every state3On Thanksgiving, people across the United States devour feasts that typically consist of turkey, stuffing, potatoes, and pie.

Both 19, Obama and Farquharson met at Harvard, where they're studying.

Farquharson attended the £35,000-a-year private Rugby School in England.



The 19-year-old daughter of former US President Barack Obama, Malia Obama, is reportedly dating the son of a British investment manager.

After TMZ published a video of Malia Obama kissing a man during the Harvard-Yale football game over the weekend, the Daily Mail identified him as Rory Farquharson, who was head boy at a £35,000-a-year ($47,000-a-year) private school in England.

Farquharson, 19, began his studies at Harvard last year, according to Rugby School, an English private school he attended, where a term's education costs up to £11,584.

Here's Farquharson pictured in June:

He was a golf and rugby player and was selected as "head of school" for the 2015-16 year. A school friend told the Daily Mail that he was "popular" and "quite a catch."

Farquharson's CV says he spent a summer as an intern with the Centre for Democracy and Peace Building in Northern Ireland, appeared in a rugby video played at the World Cup opening ceremony in 2015 (which Prince Harry also appeared in), and was a member of the Rugby School's chemistry club, the Blue Bunsen Society.

The Telegraph reported that Farquharson's Twitter account, which has now been deleted, suggested he had an interest in investment just like his 57-year-old father, Charles, the CEO of the London-based Insight Investment Management Limited. His mother, Catherine, 58, is also a qualified accountant.

The family live in a six-bed detached home in Woodbridge, Suffolk, worth £1.6 million, The Telegraph reported.

Farquharson had also appeared to criticize US President Donald Trump on Twitter, according to The Telegraph. The Daily Mail reported, however, that Farquharson followed the current president on Twitter but did not follow Barack Obama.http://www.businessinsider.com/best-amazon-black-friday-deals-2017Amazon's best Black Friday deals you'd never find on your own5The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost economic activity annually, according to an analysis of government figures.

Leaving the EU is already dragging down the British economy.

The UK is now growing more slowly than Japan or Italy.



LONDON - Chancellor Philip Hammond's annual budget, presented yesterday, has finally given Britain the first concrete numbers on the cost of Brexit.

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility published revised GDP growth numbers based on data following the June 2016 referendum. Those new estimates suggest that Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost annual economic activity by 2021, according to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation.

Previously, the best estimate of the economic damage leaving Europe will inflict on the UK came from a private estimate by one of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis's advisors, of about £22 billion per year, mostly from extra trade tariffs and barriers.

Here are the new GDP charts from the OBR.

They show other major economies such as the US, the EU, and Canada all growing faster now than they were in the six months prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016. Only in the UK has growth slowed, as the pound lost value and investors hit the pause button. Even Japan, an infamous economic basket case hobbled by years of stagnation, is doing better than the UK:

OBR

In terms of sequential GDP growth through Q3 2017, Britain now lags France and debt-ridden Italy, too. This chart of OECD data comes from Michael Baxter of Share Centre:

The Share Centre

This next chart shows how much we are forecast to lose in GDP activity every year, based on the difference between the OBR's previous estimate in March and its new estimate, from updated post-referendum data:

OBR

The Resolution Foundation says the gap will represent a loss of £72 billion in 2021:

"The economy is now expected to be roughly £42 billion smaller at the start of 2022 than was thought back in March. This downgrade comes on top of the deterioration pencilled in after the Brexit vote of June 2016. As such, the latest GDP projections point to an economy that will be £72 billion (or 3.4 percent) smaller in 2021 than had been projected in March 2016."

That's £72 billion in lost jobs, revenues, consumer spending, and so on.

There are other factors at play, of course. A big one is the UK's chronic lack of productivity, exacerbated by its refusal to allow in the young immigrant workers to generate the income tax receipts its ageing population needs to pay for the NHS and its state pensions.

But the OBR's downward revisions from March to November of this year all come in the post-Brexit-vote period, and the only thing of macroeconomic substance that changed between then and now was the realisation that the UK is headed toward hard Brexit rather than a trade deal that would keep the country closely tied to the single market.http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-gop-tax-reform-bill-analysis-reviews-text-2017-11-1009242271The GOP tax plan got a triple whammy of brutal reviews-3Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Three new analyses of the Senate's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act all delivered bad news for Republican leaders.

The Tax Policy Center found that more than 50% of Americans would see a tax increase in 2027 under the bill.

Only one out of 42 economists surveyed by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business said the bill would increase economic growth substantially.

The Penn-Wharton Budget Model found that the bill would blow a hole in the federal deficit.



While Congress is on a weeklong Thanksgiving break, the breakneck speed of the Republican push to overhaul the US tax code has taken a bill close to passing in the Senate.

The latest version of the chamber's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed the Senate Finance Committee last Thursday, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants to bring the bill for a full Senate vote when lawmakers return from the recess.

But on Tuesday, Republicans were hit with something of a triple whammy: Three different groups offered critical analyses of the bill's potentially negative effects on the federal budget, Americans' taxes, and the broader US economy. While the Senate is still expected to make changes to the legislation, each of the new studies shows that the Senate's bill has some significant underlying issues.

Tax Policy Center says it would raise taxes on half of Americans

Perhaps the most damning of the new reports came from the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution's Tax Policy Center.

The nonpartisan group's analysis of the legislation found that while all income groups would get a tax cut from the bill in the short term and long term, many Americans would also see their taxes increase. Per the report:

In 2019: Americans on average would see their taxes cut by $1,300, an increase in take-home pay of 1.7%. Americans in the middle quintile of income earners - $50,000 to $87,000 a year - would get a tax cut of $850 on average and receive 18.4% of the tax cuts' benefits. People in the top 1% of incomes, more than $750,000 a year, would see a cut of $34,130 on average and receive 17.6% of the bill's total benefit.

Americans on average would see their taxes cut by $1,300, an increase in take-home pay of 1.7%. Americans in the middle quintile of income earners - $50,000 to $87,000 a year - would get a tax cut of $850 on average and receive 18.4% of the tax cuts' benefits. People in the top 1% of incomes, more than $750,000 a year, would see a cut of $34,130 on average and receive 17.6% of the bill's total benefit. In 2027: The bill's proposed sunset of the individual tax cuts, combined with other changes to the code, means benefits would be substantially less for the middle class. The average cut for all Americans would be just $300, and 50.3% of American households would actually see their taxes increase by this point.



Those in the middle quintile of earners would see a tax cut of just $50 on average, and 65.6% of these people would see their taxes actually go up. People in the top 1% of income earners, however, would still get a tax cut of $32,510 on average and would receive 61.8% of the total tax benefits from the plan. Just 16.8% of people in the top 1% would see a tax increase.

Economists don't think the bill will grow the economy

Trump and Republicans have argued repeatedly that the cuts in the plan would stimulate economic growth and even help "pay for" its new spending. Most economists aren't buying the rosy projections.

But according to the IGM Forum survey of 42 academic economists by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, only one economist agreed that "US GDP will be substantially higher a decade from now" than under the current baseline.

In fact, 52% disagreed or strongly disagreed that the bill would lead to significant economic growth, and 36% were uncertain.

And when asked whether the "US debt-to-GDP ratio will be substantially higher" in 10 years under the bill compared with current law, 88% of the economists agreed or strongly agreed, 2% were uncertain, and the rest abstained.

Penn-Wharton budget model says the bill will blow a hole in the deficit

The final rough analysis for the legislation came from a new report from the University of Pennsylvania, using its Penn-Wharton Budget Model to assess the potential budgetary effects of the bill.

While Trump administration officials say the legislation would pay for itself, some Senate Republicans have been hesitant to support the bill over concerns that it would cause a massive increase in the federal debt.

The Penn model found that the bill would increase the federal deficit by $1.327 trillion over the first 10 years after it becomes law (not including debt-service costs). Even when factoring in the economic boost from the tax cuts, according to the report, the bill would still add $1.271 trillion in debt.

Either way, the model concludes that much like the House version of the bill, the Senate bill would not come close to paying for itself.http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-cash-price-rises-november-23-2017-11-1009208964Bitcoin cash is jumping3Bitcoin cash up 17% against the dollar on Thursday morning.

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled that Uber can force an unhappy Connecticut customer's price-fixing case against the ride-service company into arbitration, after the customer said the proposed class action belonged in court because he never agreed to arbitrate.

In an order dated Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan also dismissed claims by the customer, Spencer Meyer, against former Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, unless Meyer wished to arbitrate.

Rakoff, long a critic of mandatory arbitration, said he would explain his reasoning later. Reuters obtained a copy of his order, which was not available in online court records.

"We are awaiting the court's opinion and will consider all options as to how to proceed," John Briody, a lawyer for Meyer, said in an email on Thursday.

Uber said in an email: "We are pleased with the court's decision." Lawyers for Kalanick did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment.

Arbitration clauses are often buried in lengthy terms of service that customers never see or would struggle to read.

Critics say the clauses, which often forbid class actions, dissuade many people from pursuing claims at all.

Meyer had accused San Francisco-based Uber and Kalanick of conspiring with drivers, whose earnings are shared with Uber, to charge "surge pricing" fares during peak demand periods.

He said he never agreed to arbitrate because a keypad had obscured a hyperlink to Uber's terms of service, including the arbitration clause, when he signed up with his smartphone.

Uber countered that Meyer had an unobstructed view of the hyperlink, and waived the keypad issue because he could have raised it sooner. The lawsuit began in December 2015.

Kalanick said claims against him must be dismissed because he was no longer Uber's chief executive. He resigned in June after a shareholder revolt.

On Aug. 17, the federal appeals court in Manhattan had reinstated the arbitration provision, overturning a July 2016 ruling by Rakoff that found it unenforceable.

Later that month, the appeals court said Rakoff may consider new evidence about how long Uber customers could see the hyperlink, including when entering credit card information.

Internet companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have argued during the litigation that a loss by Uber could inhibit e-commerce and threaten the enforceability of online contracts.

The "Current and Future Trends in RX-to-OTC Switching with Insight from Key Industry Opinion Leaders" report has been added to Research and Markets' offering.

The report Current and Future Trends in Rx-to-OTC Switching with Insight from Key Industry Opinion Leaders analyzes contemporary trends in Rx-to-OTC switching, a process in which a drug which has formerly been marketed as a prescription-only Rx drug is authorized for sale to the general public, without the need for a prescription.

Rx-to-OTC switching is the process of transferring Rx pharmaceuticals to non-prescription OTC status for the same dosage form, population, and route of administration. OTC drugs are defined as those that are safe and effective for use by the general public without requiring intervention from a healthcare professional to obtain the product. Therefore, OTC medicines are available through a far wider range of channels than Rx drugs, including pharmacies, department stores and E-commerce.

Drug switches can therefore make access to treatments much easier for patients. This offers the added benefit of freeing general practitioners from spending office time on minor issues or chronic conditions that patients can manage on their own.

For pharmaceutical companies, Rx-to-OTC switches allow lifecycle extension of an off-patent drug, moving it from an environment in which healthcare providers drive sales to one in which patients select their own medications and will often demonstrate brand loyalty towards the original drug. In general, the broadened availability of OTC products can often mean that sales of the drug will increase, in spite of the lower price point at which such drugs are sold.



Based on overall revenue, the OTC pharmaceutical market has been dominated by four main categories: cough, cold, and allergy; analgesics; dermatologicals; and gastrointestinals. These categories have led the OTC drugs market over the last two decades in revenue and volume.



Key barriers to switching include the potential for misuse and abuse of drugs, particularly for analgesics, and the resultant need to demonstrate safety and clear labelling to regulatory agencies. A lack of harmonization in OTC approval processes between different countries also increases the burden for companies that want to launch their products across multiple territories.

Here is what you need to know.

President Donald Trump said the AT&T-Time Warner deal is 'not good for the country'. He made the comments to reporters on the White House lawn, and they came one day after the US Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's $84.5 billion takeover of Time Warner.

Meg Whitman is stepping down from the CEO job at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It was an unexpected announcement that comes several months after she was identified as interviewing for the CEO job at Uber, though she ultimately did not get it. She'll be replaced by Antonio Neri, currently the president of HPE.

Uber reportedly paid hackers $100,000 to cover up a cyberattack that exposed the personal data of 57 million people. The data breach, which occurred in October 2016, was not made public until Tuesday when Uber quietly published a blog post about the incident.

Salesforce's third quarter revenues were up 25% from last year. Earlier in November, the company announced its revenue growth plan and a timeline which includes more than doubling its annual revenues from $8.4 billion in 2017 to $20 billion by 2022.

Dash, the fifth largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high. Posts on Reddit and chatrooms like 4Chan suggest that Dash could soon be highlighted as an investment opportunity in Palm Beach Confidential, a cryptocurrency investment newsletter.

Mandalay Bay is in crisis as hundreds of Las Vegas shooting victims accuse hotel of missing red flags. They're filing lawsuits against the operator of the hotel where the gunman was staying.

A $9 billion French asset manager is launching Europe's first bitcoin mutual fund. Tobam, which had $9 billion in assets under management as of September, plans to launch an unregulated alternative investment fund that will allow institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin.

Australia just received another worrying reading on the fragility of household finances. The National Australia Bank's Cashless Retail Sales Index, a measures of spending patterns from its customers using debit and credit cards, BPAY, and Paypal, grew by just 0.2% last month, leaving the year-over-year increase at 6.5%, the weakest level in the three-year history of the survey.

Stock markets around the world climbed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (+0.62%) rose in Asia, while the Nikkei increased (+0.5%). The FTSE 100 (+0.60%) led gains across Europe, which saw the Euro Stoxx 50 rise (+0.42%). The S&P 500 is set to open up 0.1% near 2,599 a day after closing at a record high.http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-att-time-warner-deal-not-good-for-country-2017-11-1008985655Trump says the AT&T-Time Warner deal is 'not good for the country' (T, TWX)-3Reuters / Carlo Allegri

President Donald Trump told White House reporters on Tuesday that AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner is "not good for the country."

The comments echo those made by Trump on the campaign trail in October 2016.

Trump has been a staunch opponent of the deal for over a year, and has repeatedly voiced his displeasure with CNN, which is owned by Time Warner.



The hits keep coming for AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.

President Donald Trump spoke to reporters on the White House lawn on Tuesday afternoon, saying, "Personally, I always felt that was a deal that's not good for the country. He also said, "I'm not going to get involved - it's litigation."

His comments come one day after the US Department of Justice sued to block AT&T's $84.5 billion takeover of Time Warner.

The statements echo comments Trump made on the campaign trail back in October 2016, when he said a successful deal would result in "too much concentration of power in the hands of too few," and also said "deals like this destroy democracy."

Trump's Justice Department - most notably Makan Delrahim, the antitrust chief he nominated - would seem to agree. In a complaint filed on Monday, the regulatory body focused on what it sees as potentially anti-competitive behavior that could result from a completed deal. AT&T already owns DirecTV, which is mentioned throughout the complaint as a particular cause for concern.

The news of the antitrust lawsuit followed recent reports that the Justice Department demanded AT&T and Time Warner sell Turner Broadcasting, the group of channels that includes CNN, to receive approval for the deal. The entire ordeal comes amid Trump's repeated insistence that CNN is "fake news."

Regulatory concerns about the merger have ramped up since Delrahim started in his new role. After assuming duties in September, he pushed for the divestiture of either Turner Broadcasting or DirecTV during negotiations, according to a Bloomberg report.

Trump's concerns echo those expressed by many critics of the deal who think that too much consolidation in the media and telecom industries is ultimately bad for both. Still, antitrust experts have said that on a strictly legal basis, fighting the deal might be difficult for the DOJ.

Whether the deal can proceed will be up to a federal judge. It's also possible the two sides will negotiate a settlement that would allow it to continue.

AT&T's stock slid 0.9% for Tuesday's session, while Time Warner shares were little changed.

Markets Insiderhttp://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-tax-reform-cheap-hedges-to-protect-against-failure-2017-11-1008961712There's a cheap way for traders to protect against tax reform failure3Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms are bullish on US stocks for 2018, estimating that the index will continue to rise.

A big part of that optimism centers around tax reform, for which expectations are being priced into forecasts.

Goldman says that it's wise to hedge against tax reform failure, especially since one specific options trade is so inexpensive right now.



Strategists up and down Wall Street are bullish on stocks through the end of next year, and a big part of that stems from optimism around tax reform. But by that same token, if policy progress fails to materialize, that could spark a considerable sell off in equities.

Luckily, market conditions are shaping up to give traders an inexpensive way to hedge against this potential loss, says Goldman Sachs.

The firm's derivatives strategy team has concocted a trade known as a put spread: Buy a specific number of S&P 500 contracts expiring in February with a strike price of 2,525, while selling the same number of February puts with a strike price of 2,400.

For reference, bearish put spreads are used when a moderate decline in the underlying asset is expected - in this case, Goldman's trade will be "in the money" about 5% below the S&P 500's current level.

"Failure of tax reform is enough of a short-term possibility that it is worth hedging," Rocky Fishman, an equity derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in a client note. "With the S&P 500 within 1% of its high, we believe prudent investors should take advantage of low option prices to hedge."

So what makes this particular trade so attractively priced? Goldman attributes it to historically low volatility and high skew, the latter of which reflects the willingness of investors to pay a premium for calls. The combination of the two factors "gives put spreads materially higher payout multiples than they usually have," says Fishman.

Goldman Sachs

Lastly, Goldman stresses that buying the put spread is the best way to hedge against tax reform downside, rather than simply holding money on the sidelines. This is both because the options are cheap right now, and because it provides better outcomes in a wider range of market scenarios.

"Prudent investors should own stocks and hedge with put spreads instead of running high cash balances," said Fishman.http://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/r-canada-stocks-futures-gain-on-higher-oil-prices-2017-11-1008934277Canadian futures gain on higher oil prices (BBD., TRP, ATD.)0Nov 21 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada's main stock index on Tuesday as oil prices rose with traders looking forward to next week's OPEC meeting when major exporters are expected to extend production cuts.

Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading, has an overview of today's markets.

Here's Lutz:

Morning! US Futures are mixed, with the Spoos and Russell off small, while Nasdaq Outperforming as M&A Heats up in Semis (MRVL for CAVM). Decent rally from lows going on overseas, as the DAX has busted green, with a sharp rebound is happening in the Banks. DB and Commerz are up 2% from intraday lows. Carmakers are revving up, with VW up nearly 4%. Utes are the finally leg in the rally today, as German Political angst sparks thots of easing environmental regulations. Healthcare acting well behind Roche’s 4% pop on trial headers. FTSE is lagging a bit, as the Miners see profit-taking, but Volumes in London are off 30%+ to trend. In Asia, Sellers returned to Japan where the Nikkei lost 60bp - Hang Seng gained 20bp and Shanghai up 20bp, while Shenzhen up 1%, shrugging off China Financial Regulation headlines - KOSPI down 20bp, but KOSDAQ up 1.2%, while Aussie lost small as Miners were under pressure

Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high Tuesday above $8,300 per coin.

The coin recovered losses it incurred after a different cryptocurrency announced a $30.9 million hack.

Bitcoin's upward climbed continued unabated Monday morning.

The cryptocurrency blew past Monday's record high of $8,285 to $8,368 Tuesday morning, trading up 1.24%. It gave up some of those gains and was trading at $8,289 just before noon ET.

The coin was sent in a tailspin after news broke that cryptocurrency firm, Tether, was hacked.

Tether, which created a cryptocurrency called USDT that is pegged to the dollar, said in a blog post on Tuesday that "funds were improperly removed from the Tether treasury wallet through malicious action by an external attacker."

The US-based company said $30,950,010 was taken Sunday.

Th news dragged the price of bitcoin down by nearly $450 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk data.http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/cryptocurrency-ico-bubble-2017-11-1008932213This is the tech bubble we have been waiting for-5CNBC screengrab

Smart people like the venture capitalist Bill Gurley are beginning to worry that so-called initial coin offerings are a bubble.

People are investing in bitcoin and other digital coins even though they hold no equity value and offer no claims on any kind of underlying asset.

On that definition, ICOs are actually worse than dot-com stocks in 1999 — at least back then investors owned a piece of a company with a revenue stream.

Crypto bulls keep saying bitcoin is "an established store of value."

The problem is that the value being stored is simply everyone else's agreement that there must be value here. There is no other asset. And that is what a bubble looks like.



The venture capitalist Bill Gurley was recently asked whether he thought cryptocurrency "initial coin offerings" were in a bubble. Billions of dollars have been poured into more than 1,000 new digital coins issued by startups this year. These coins mimic the construction of bitcoin, meaning they can be freely traded on digital exchanges and have no central bank standing behind them.

Gurley had an interesting answer. Yes, he said, ICOs look speculative, because interest rates are so low and "there is nowhere [else] to put money."

"As long as those interest rates stay as low as they are, I think you'll continue to see some form of speculative behaviour, and tech is a great place for speculation," he told CNBC. "Look at what is going on in the ICO market, in cryptocurrencies, and you see that no one is afraid to speculate in this market."

The ICO sector today has one big thing in common with the dot-com bubble of 1999: People are "investing" vast sums of money into "assets" that have no history of producing revenue, and those assets are rising in price only because other people are also pouring money into them.

Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, was launched through an ICO in 2014. Ethereum has risen by over 3,000% against the dollar in 2017, and its success is one of the reasons people are feeling good about crypto right now. But many of the other coins that have sprung up in its wake look a lot more risky.

$200 billion invested in something that cannot be described as an 'asset'

The amount of money being poured into ICOs is vast. As these charts from Goldman Sachs show, ICO investment is now a larger source of new investment money than traditional early-stage VC tech-startup investment:

Goldman SachsThe total market, including bitcoin, is now worth more than $200 billion, or £151 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com:

CoinMarketCap.com

The chart below from Shane Oliver, the chief economist and chief investment officer at AMP Capital, puts bitcoin in historical perspective with other major asset bubbles. The lines on the chart are indexed to make them comparable to one another and show that the rush into bitcoin is roughly comparable to the dot-com bubble in 1999-2000.

Investing in poker chips, hookers, and a really big fish tank

In an ICO, a company offers to sell digital tokens to fund its business. The tokens (or "coins") may allow the buyer to get a product or service from the new company at a later date. Like bitcoin, their value can go up and down, and they can be bought and sold in an open market. The ownership of the coins is recorded on blockchains, which are secure, open-source ledgers that underpin the currencies and are protected by cryptography.

The bet with an ICO is that a token will rise in value. There are two sources of demand for tokens: from people who need them to redeem services from the company that issued them and from other investors who think the token will rise in price like a stock or a currency.

There is an argument that many ICOs should not be described as "investments" because they do not give buyers actual equity in the companies that offer them, only credit that can be redeemed at a later date. At Ethereum's launch, for instance, the founder Vitalik Buterin made it explicit that Ethereum and its ether currency were not the same as an equity investment:

"Ether is a product, NOT a security or investment offering. Ether is simply a token useful for paying transaction fees or building or purchasing decentralized application services on the Ethereum platform; it does not give you voting rights over anything, and we make no guarantees of its future value."

My favourite example of this phenomenon is the cryptocurrency casino that wants to give buyers nonnegotiable coins that can be gambled inside a hotel that will float in the sea off Macau. The company, Dragon Corp., is literally asking you to "invest" in poker chips.

That isn't even the wildest ICO so far. We have also seen:

Worse than the dot-com bubble of 1999

In some ways, ICOs are worse than dot-com stocks in 1999. At least with a dot-com stock you owned an actual piece of equity in the underlying company (even if, like TheGlobe.com, a failed social-media network, it had revenue of only $780,000 a quarter).

The assets being offered in an ICO aren't backed by an existing revenue stream. Rather, it is a speculative bet on the success of some future product, and you must make that bet before the company has created the product you're buying.

On that measure, dot-com companies actually looked more solid than ICOs. Pets.com actually sold pet food. Boo.com actually sold clothes. There was something there, even if it didn't make profits as a business.

With ICOs you don't even have that. It's a bit like Mark Zuckerberg funding the early days of Facebook by offering you credit for free "likes" instead of common stock.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are Google and Amazon ... ICOs are Pets.com and Boo.com

It's perhaps worth drawing a distinction here between the two big cryptocurrency players, bitcoin and Ethereum, and the thousands of "altcoins" that have been issued this year. Unlike most ICO coins, bitcoin and Ethereum aren't geared toward specific projects. Bitcoin is an all-purpose digital asset, and Ethereum's ether is meant to underpin an all-purpose application platform, which multiple blue-chip companies are looking at using. Bitcoin and Ethereum are useful because they are widely used, like cash. Altcoins, however, are credits for a limited, defined service.

It is obviously not the case that because much of the crypto sphere is a bubble that it is all a bubble. The dot-com bust of 2000 didn't prove that the entire internet was useless — just that it was inflated with immature ideas. Bitcoin and Ethereum may turn out to be the Google and Amazon of crypto, but there will be plenty of altcoin equivalents of Pets.com and Boo.com, too.

Gurley was also asked whether bitcoin was a bubble. He said no. Bitcoin is different, he said.

I don't think it's a fraud.

"I think of it as an incredible store of value in the rest of the world," he said, adding: "I don't think it's a fraud."

At the massive Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal, this year, I heard a version of that phrase a lot: "Bitcoin is an established store of value." It was like a mantra. People said it as if merely repeating it made it truer.

But there is a real problem with that formulation.

A "store of value" is a term used to refer to an asset that can be saved and reliably sold at a later date because it predictably maintains its value over time. Traditional stores of value include money (pounds, euros, and dollars), stocks, bonds, gold, and property. There are many others. These assets "store value" because when you want to exchange them they have most likely retained most of their value or increased it. They achieve this by giving the owner a claim on an underlying asset that has its own use: Money is backed by a central bank guaranteeing its value with actual assets on a balance sheet; stocks offer dividends and future earnings; bonds pay interest; gold can be used for jewelry or manufacturing; and you can live in or rent property until it can be sold.

When the property bubble collapsed in 2008, at least people still owned houses

The problem with bitcoin is that it isn't backed by a useful asset. Its price is set only by supply and demand. That means bitcoin can go to zero, because there are zero assets behind it, if people suddenly agree that bitcoin on its own is worthless.

Stocks, bonds, and houses can collapse in value too, of course. But even when they do, you still own a stock, or a bond, or a house.

In terms of underlying assets, there is no fundamental difference between bitcoin and any of the other cryptocurrency ICOs on the market. Sure, bitcoin is now a few years old, and its price has generally gone up over time. If you bought bitcoin years ago, then it really does feel as if you stored value.

But bitcoin has no houses or stock certificates or interest coupons, and there is no company behind it generating revenue whose profits you might share. And neither do any of the other crypto coins. If these coins — including bitcoin — go to zero, then you own nothing.

This is why the crypto space has so many similar characteristics to 1999. (Take it from me: I lived through 1999, including the worthless stock certificates and the unemployment payments that came after it).

With cryptocurrencies, the value being stored is simply everyone else's agreement that there must be value here. There is no other asset.

And that is what a bubble looks like.http://markets.businessinsider.com/etfs/direxion-daily-junior-gold-miners-idx-bull-3x-shsDIREXION DAILY JUNIOR GOLD MINERS IDX BULL 3X SHS ETFs0No portfolio available. Please provide the name of the new portfolio additionally.

The NFC is loaded, with the Eagles showing no signs of slowing down, the Saints bringing their win streak to eight games, and the Vikings, Rams, Panthers, Lions, Falcons, and Seahawks locked in a death race that will leave at least one good team out of the postseason. The AFC, meanwhile, appears to be the Patriots and the Steelers — and then everyone else. The Chiefs are sliding, and we're still waiting for the Jaguars to prove they're a true threat in the postseason. See where each team stands as we head into Week 12: View As: One Page Slides

32. Cleveland Browns Record: 0-10 Last week: Lost to the Jaguars, 19-7 This week: at Cincinnati Bengals One thing to know: The Browns' Week 11 loss was their 35th loss in 37 games. Time is running out to get win No. 1 this year.

31. San Francisco 49ers Record: 1-9 Last week: Bye This week: vs. Seattle Seahawks One thing to know: C.J. Beathard led the Niners to their first win of the year, against the Giants, in their last game before their bye week, but the newly acquired Jimmy Garoppolo has now had an extra week of practice to get up to speed on the San Francisco offense. Will this be the day we finally see Jimmy G make his debut?

30. Chicago Bears Record: 3-7 Last week: Lost to the Lions, 27-24 This week: at Philadelphia Eagles One thing to know: The Bears cut kicker Connor Barth after he missed what would have been the tying field goal with eight seconds left on Sunday. "It wasn’t going great," head coach John Fox said after the team cut Barth.

29. New York Giants Record: 2-8 Last week: Beat the Chiefs, 12-9 This week: at Washington Redskins One thing to know: The Giants' win against the Chiefs may have made Ben McAdoo's continued employment a bit easier to swallow for New York fans, but it also hurt the team's chances in the race for a top 2018 draft pick.

28. Denver Broncos Record: 3-7 Last week: Lost to the Bengals, 20-17 This week: at Oakland Raiders One thing to know: Six straight losses and seven in eight games have left the Broncos a mess. The team fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy after just 10 games, and GM John Elway called the team "soft," a comment with which some players did not agree.

27. Indianapolis Colts Record: 3-7 Last week: Bye This week: vs. Tennessee Titans One thing to know: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett is still expected to start Sunday despite being in concussion protocol, a reality that prompts the question: What ever happened to Andrew Luck?

26. Cincinnati Bengals Record: 4-6 Last week: Beat the Broncos, 20-17 This week: vs. Cleveland Browns One thing to know: After cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick failed to return an interception for a touchdown in the thin Denver air, his teammates gave him an oxygen tank as a gift.

25. Miami Dolphins Record: 4-6 Last week: Lost to the Buccaneers, 30-20 This week: at New England Patriots One thing to know: The Dolphins have lost four straight but remain in the playoff hunt in the weak AFC. Jay Cutler left Week 11 after three interceptions and was placed in concussion protocol, meaning it may be Matt Moore's show in Week 12.

24. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Record: 4-6 Last week: Beat the Dolphins, 30-20 This week: at Atlanta Falcons One thing to know: With their second straight win with Ryan Fitzpatrick at the helm, there's an argument to be made that the Buccaneers have looked stronger this year under his leadership than that of Jameis Winston.

23. Houston Texans Record: 4-6 Last week: Beat the Cardinals, 31-21 This week: at Baltimore Ravens One thing to know: Last weekend gave the Texans their first win since rookie sensation Deshaun Watson went down with a season-ending injury. It was a solid win, but Tom Savage and company will have a tougher go at it this weekend against a Ravens defense that has already recorded three shutouts on the year.

22. New York Jets Record: 4-6 Last week: Bye This week: vs. Carolina Panthers One thing to know: The Jets remain in the playoff hunt, but it won't be easy. They still have to play the 7-3 Panthers, the 6-4 Chiefs, the 8-2 Saints, and the 8-2 Patriots.

21. Buffalo Bills Record: 5-5 Last week: Lost to the Chargers, 54-24 This week: at Kansas City Chiefs One thing to know: The Bills' decision to bench Tyrod Taylor for the rookie Nathan Peterman backfired immediately, with Peterman throwing five interceptions in just two quarters before being pulled. Will the Buffalo coaching staff stick to its guns or put Taylor back under center to try to save the team's push for the playoffs?

20. Arizona Cardinals Record: 4-6 Last week: Lost to the Texans, 31-21 This week: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars One thing to know: After catching a touchdown pass from Blaine Gabbert, Larry Fitzgerald has now caught TDs from 14 quarterbacks, the most of any active receiver, per ESPN.

19. Green Bay Packers Record: 5-5 Last week: Lost to the Ravens, 23-0 This week: at Pittsburgh Steelers One thing to know: At 5-5, the Packers are somehow still in the hunt for a playoff spot in the NFC, but Green Bay will still need to put together some wins without Aaron Rodgers before it's worth it for him to make his return even if he isn't back at 100%.

18. Washington Redskins Record: 4-6 Last week: Lost to the Saints, 34-31 This week: vs. New York Giants One thing to know: The Redskins' season has been marked by falling short in tight games. That was the case in Week 11 when they blew a 15-point lead to the Saints in the fourth quarter and lost in overtime, most likely ending their playoff hopes.

17. Oakland Raiders Record: 4-6 Last week: Lost to the Patriots, 33-8 This week: vs. Denver Broncos One thing to know: The Raiders fired their defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. after Oakland's pitiful performance against the Patriots in Mexico City. Facing a struggling Broncos offense, the Silver and Black will have a good chance to regroup.

16. Dallas Cowboys Record: 5-5 Last week: Lost to the Eagles, 37-9 This week: vs. Los Angeles Chargers One thing to know: The Cowboys have been a mess without Ezekiel Elliott. During the two games Elliott has missed, the Cowboys have scored just 16 points. Injuries to the offensive line haven’t helped, either, as Dak Prescott has been sacked 12 times and thrown three interceptions.

15. Los Angeles Chargers Record: 4-6 Last week: Beat the Bills, 54-24 This week: at Dallas Cowboys One thing to know: The Chargers' defense hauled in five interceptions from rookie quarterback Nathan Peterman but will have to keep the energy up on short rest to play the Cowboys on Thanksgiving.

14. Baltimore Ravens Record: 5-5 Last week: Beat the Packers, 23-0 This week: vs. Houston Texans One thing to know: Joe Flacco has had one of the worst seasons of his career, but ESPN still gives the Ravens a 73% chance of making the playoffs. Flacco should be helped by the return of Danny Woodhead to the Ravens' backfield.

13. Seattle Seahawks Record: 6-4 Last week: Lost to the Falcons, 34-31 This week: at San Francisco 49ers One thing to know: The Seahawks fell just inches short of another impressive last-second comeback when Blair Walsh's kick failed to reach the uprights. While the kick earned the headlines, Pete Carroll's decision to go for a fake field goal before halftime may have cost the Seahawks a crucial victory as they fight to secure a playoff spot.

12. Tennessee Titans Record: 6-4 Last week: Lost to the Steelers, 40-17 This week: at Indianapolis Colts One thing to know: The Titans still have a good chance to make the playoffs, but many members of the team are upset with the lack of growth on offense. Despite all of their weapons, the Titans rank 16th in offensive DVOA and have scored over 25 points just three times.

11. Detroit Lions Record: 6-4 Last week: Beat the Bears, 27-24 This week: vs. Minnesota Vikings One thing to know: Matthew Stafford and the Lions took down the Vikings last year on Thanksgiving with the help of a last-second field goal from Matt Prater. This year, a victory is all the more crucial to Detroit's chances of making the postseason.

10. Kansas City Chiefs Record: 6-4 Last week: Lost to the Giants, 12-9 This week: vs. Buffalo Bills One thing to know: The Chiefs have lost four of their past five games after a 5-0 start. Alex Smith didn’t throw an interception through October but has now thrown three interceptions and just two touchdowns in November.

9. Atlanta Falcons Record: 6-4 Last week: Beat the Seahawks, 34-31 This week: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers One thing to know: The Falcons' offense looked strong against a deflated Seattle secondary, but their defense gave up two quick drives in the final minutes of the game that surely gave Atlanta fans Super Bowl flashbacks.

8. Jacksonville Jaguars Record: 7-3 Last week: Beat the Browns, 19-7 This week: at Arizona Cardinals One thing to know: As ESPN’s Bill Barnwell wrote, the Jaguars' two big free-agent signings are paying off. Calais Campbell and A.J. Bouye have terrorized opposing offenses, with Campbell racking up 11.5 sacks and three forced fumbles while Bouye has three interceptions. Name an offense that would be excited to face this group in the postseason.

7. Los Angeles Rams Record: 7-3 Last week: Lost to the Vikings, 24-7 This week: vs. New Orleans Saints One thing to know: After the Rams scored 84 points in their previous two games, they looked surprisingly human against the Vikings, with a first-quarter Todd Gurley touchdown as their only score on the day. Los Angeles has proved it can roll over the mediocre defenses across the league, but the Rams will have to figure out a way to put up points against stronger units if they hope to make a postseason run.

6. Carolina Panthers Record: 7-3 Last week: Bye This week: at New York Jets One thing to know: The Panthers are happy to get tight end Greg Olsen and Pro Bowl center Ryan Kalil back for the stretch run. Cam Newton won't complain about more protection and better receiving options.

5. Pittsburgh Steelers Record: 8-2 Last week: Beat the Titans, 40-17 This week: vs. Green Bay Packers One thing to know: The Steelers have now relatively quietly rattled off five straight wins and could easily run through three more games before a potential powerhouse matchup against the Patriots in Week 15 that could determine which team gets home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

4. Minnesota Vikings Record: 8-2 Last week: Beat the Rams, 24-7 This week: at Detroit Lions One thing to know: The Vikings had a convincing win over the Rams in Week 11, helped by their dominant defense and a steady performance from Case Keenum. Even with Teddy Bridgewater lurking, Keenum has been too good for the Vikings to pull.

3. New England Patriots Record: 8-2 Last week: Beat the Raiders, 33-8 This week: vs. Miami Dolphins One thing to know: The Patriots have punted just three times in the past two games while amassing 74 points. Tom Brady and Bill Belichick's offense once again feels unstoppable.

2. New Orleans Saints Record: 8-2 Last week: Beat the Redskins, 34-31 This week: at Los Angeles Rams One thing to know: The Saints kept their win streak alive with a stunning comeback late in the fourth quarter against the Redskins. Behind their eight-game win streak has been a suddenly dominant defense that has done a 180 from being ranked 31st and 32nd in DVOA the past three years.

1. Philadelphia Eagles Record: 9-1 Last week: Beat the Cowboys, 37-9 This week: vs. Chicago Bears One thing to know: The Eagles were down 9-7 at halftime of their "Sunday Night Football" matchup against the Cowboys before coming back to throttle Dallas in the second half. Even the loss of their kicker Jake Elliott couldn't stop the team, with linebacker Kamu Grugier-Hill stepping into kickoff duties and the team converting three of four two-point conversion attempts.http://www.businessinsider.com/8-team-college-football-playoff-2017-11We projected an 8-team College Football Playoff and it would be amazing5The latest playoff ranking is out and Miami is up to No. 2 ahead of Clemson.

It's clear that an 8-team playoff would be amazing and would answer all the debates.

A projected playoff would include all the major conference champs and Central Florida.



The latest College Football Playoff ranking is out and not much changed as Alabama, Miami, Clemson, and Oklahoma remain the top four teams — Miami moved ahead of Clemson and are now second — and Wisconsin remains the fifth team just waiting to move ahead of the team that loses the ACC title game, Miami or Clemson.

While the playoff appears to be headed towards a major debate over the final spots, and at least one Power 5 Conference champion is going to be left out, one thing is clear: an 8-team playoff this season would be awesome.

Below, we projected what an 8-team playoff might look like this season if things continue the way they are going now.

To determine the field for an 8-team playoff, we projected the champions of the five major BCS conferences, and then gave the final three spots to the highest ranked team from a Group of 5 conference and two at-large teams.

Here is what the 8-team playoff would look like:

We assumed that higher ranked teams win all remaining games and that Clemson would still be ranked ahead of Auburn and Georgia if all three lost one more game.

Alabama (SEC), Miami (ACC), Oklahoma (Big 12), Wisconsin (Big Ten), and USC (Pac-12) are the projected champions of the Power 5 conferences. Central Florida would be the representative from the Group of 5 conferences. And the two at-large teams would be Notre Dame and Clemson, with both ranked ahead of USC and UCF.

Under this scenario, the top six teams in the playoff ranking would be included in the playoff. The biggest losers in this scenario would be a potentially 2-loss Georgia team and a potentially 2-loss Penn State team. This assumes Auburn loses to Alabama, Georgia loses to Alabama in the SEC title game, and Ohio State loses to Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game.

The playoff could certainly include a provision requiring the top Group of 5 team to be ranked in the top 15 or top 25 (UCF is currently ranked 15th). If no team met the minimum standard, the final spot would go to an additional at-large team (e.g. Georgia or Penn State).

Now imagine a New Year's Day slate of the four quarterfinal matchups listed above. A week later, we would potentially see semifinal matchups of Alabama vs. Notre Dame, and Oklahoma vs. Miami. Now that is two weeks of dream football before we even got to the championship game.

Everybody would win.http://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-they-now-2013-nba-draft-giannis-antetokounmpo-2017-11WHERE ARE THEY NOW: The players that teams are kicking themselves for drafting before Giannis Antetokounmpo in 20133Giannis Antetokounmpo has become a superstar for the Milwaukee Bucks, a two-way, athletic force who's already dominating at 23 years old. Yet four years ago, few people in the NBA could have ever seen this coming. When Antetokounmpo was taken 15th in the 2013 draft, he was lanky forward from Greece few people knew about. The potential was there, but could he put it all together? Now, looking back, 14 teams missed the opportunity to draft a star that has become the clear-cut best player from the draft. Take a look back at the 2013 draft and the 14 players picked before him. View As: One Page Slides

The Cleveland Cavaliers took Anthony Bennett with the No. 1 pick.

Bennett never panned out in the NBA. He played on four teams in four years. He was most recently waived by the Suns in October.

The Orlando Magic took Victor Oladipo with the second pick.

Oladipo now plays for the Indiana Pacers. He has career averages of 16 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game.

The Washington Wizards took Otto Porter Jr. with the third pick.

Porter signed a four-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Wizards this offseason.

The Charlotte Hornets took Cody Zeller with the fourth pick.

Zeller is still with Charlotte today. He has career averages of 8 points and 5 rebounds per game.

The Phoenix Suns took Alex Len with the fifth pick.

Len is still with the Suns and has career averages of 7 points and 6 rebounds per game.

The New Orleans Pelicans took Nerlens Noel with the sixth pick and traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers.

The 76ers traded Noel to the Mavericks last season where he still plays today.

The Sacramento Kings took Ben McLemore with the seventh pick.

After four season with the Kings, McLemore signed with the Memphis Grizzlies this offseason. He has career averages of 9 points and 2 rebounds per game.

The Detroit Pistons took Kentavious Caldwell-Pope with the eighth pick.

Caldwell-Pope joined the Lakers this summer and has averaged 11 points and three rebounds per game over his career.

The Minnesota Timberwolves took Trey Burke with the ninth pick and traded him to the Utah Jazz.

Burke played on two teams in four years and now plays for the Knicks' G-League affiliate.

The Portland Trail Blazers took C.J. McCollum with the 10th pick.

McCollum has become one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, averaging over 20 points per game the last three seasons.

The Philadelphia 76ers took Michael Carter-Williams with the 11th pick.

Despite winning Rookie of the Year, Carter-Williams has hopped around the NBA and now plays for the Hornets.

The Oklahoma City Thunder took Steven Adams with the 12th pick.

Adams is still with the Thunder and has become one of the best defensive centers in the NBA.

The Dallas Mavericks took Kelly Olynyk with the 13th pick, but traded him to the Boston Celtics.

Olynyk played four years with the Celtics and signed a $60 million contract with the Heat this summer.

The Utah Jazz took Shabazz Muhammad with the 14th pick but traded him to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Muhammad is still on the Wolves today.

The Milwaukee Bucks took a risk with the 15th pick, drafting a little-known 19-year-old forward from Greece named Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Antetokounmpo has developed into one of the best players in the NBA and is in the run for MVP this season.http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-picks-microsoft-cortana-elo-week-12-2017-11The computers are on fire picking NFL games — here are their picks for Week 123After a slow start to the season, Cortana and Elo have caught fire in recent weeks.

The two models we're tracking have correctly picked 64% of the games this season.

Cortana has nailed 78% of the games in the last 5 weeks.



The NFL season is now in Week 12, and the two computer models we are tracking have caught fire in recent weeks.

We took a look at two popular systems used to pick NFL games: Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, and Elo, the modeling system used by Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight.

In both cases, the computers are picking outright winners and not against the spread. However, each gives a likelihood of a team's winning, which, in theory, could help measure the strength of certain lines.

Both models have been on fire in recent weeks. Cortana went 9-5 in Week 11 and is now 54-15 (78%) over the last five weeks. It is now 105-55 (66%) overall, five games better than Elo (100-60, 63%). Elo went 8-6 in Week 11.

Here are the picks for Week 12, with each model's percent chance of winning in parentheses. Games in bold are where the two models disagree on who has the best chance to win. Point spreads are just for reference, via Vegas Insider as of Thursday morning.

Mondayhttp://www.businessinsider.com/how-old-was-manute-bol-he-was-old-2017-11College coach who recruited Manute Bol to the US says the 7-foot-7 basketballer might have been 50 years old when he played in the NBA-2Manute Bol came to the United States from Sudan in the mid-1980s.

He may have already been in his 40s as a college player who was listed as being 23 years old.

If true, Bol would have been at least 50 years old in his final NBA season.



Former NBA player Manute Bol died in 2010. It was reported that he was 47 at the time, but according to the coach who brought the 7-foot-7 Sudanese-born player to the United States, Bol was probably much older.

Former Cleveland State coach Kevin Mackey told Adam Zagoria of Zagsblog that Bol might have already been in his late 40s or even early 50s when he was still playing in the NBA in the early 1990s.

According to Mackey, he made up a birthdate for Bol when he recruited him to Cleveland State in 1984 because even Bol did not know how old he was.

"I gave him his birthday because they didn’t know how old he was," Mackey told Zagoria. "[Bol] had no idea of his age and the kid who came over with him didn’t know how old he was. No one knew how old he was."

Mackey went on to explain that he made Bol 23 years old at the time but thinks the player might have already been in his 40s in 1984.

"I wanted to make sure he was young enough because he didn’t have an age," Mackey said. "I think he was [in his 40s], I really do. But there’s no way of ever really knowing ... Every athletic door is open at 19, every athletic door is closed when you’re 35. He was probably 40, 50 years old when he was playing in the NBA."

Bol never played at Cleveland State due to enrollment issues. He later played for a Division II school for one season and then played briefly in the USBL before moving on to a 10-year NBA career.

If Bol was already 40 in the mid-1980s, he would have been approximately 50 in his final NBA season, 1994-95, with the Golden State Warriors.

Despite Bol's age, he was a player before his time. At a time when NBA teams still wanted their big men to bang down low, Bol was a 7-footer who could actually shoot when three-pointers weren't as en vogue as they are now.

Bol's son, Bol Bol, is now a high school player who recently committed to play at Oregon.http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-week-12-picks-against-the-spread-2017-11NFL WEEK 12: Our official predictions for who wins this weekend0Happy Thanksgiving! The year's best food-and-football centric holiday also brings a great slate of games to bet on this week. Personally, I am thankful for our picks last week, which went a tidy 8-5-1 against the spread to get us back on the right side of winning. I'm also thankful for home underdogs, double-digit lines, and the Philadelphia Eagles. This week is an interesting one for gamblers, with three of the highest lines of the year on the board, so let's get straight to the bets so we can make some money while we lounge around in a tryptophan haze on Thursday. All lines courtesy of the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook. LAST WEEK: 8-5-1

OVERALL: 81-73-6 View As: One Page Slides

Minnesota Vikings (-3) at Detroit Lions (Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Lions +3 The logic: This is a trap game for the Vikings if I ever saw one. Coming off a big win against one of the strongest teams in the NFC and traveling on a short week to play Matthew Stafford and a Lions team that plays well on Thanksgiving. Detroit wins this one outright.

Los Angeles Chargers (-1) at Dallas Cowboys (Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Cowboys +1 The logic: This game has gone through an absolutely terrifying amount of line movement over the past few days. After opening with the Cowboys as four-point favorites, the line has moved five points to make Dallas a slight underdog. This shift was driven by two things — a poor performance of the Cowboys on Sunday night, and an influx of money on the Chargers. Scenarios like this leave bettors with a tough choice — you can either follow the money, and lay the point with the Chargers, comfortable in the knowledge that the high-roller bettors thought it to be the right side earlier in the week, or you can take advantage of the five-point swing Vegas is now spotting you on short notice. When this game opened, I was ready to slam the Chargers — they could easily be one of the top teams in the AFC if not for their early season field-goal struggles, and the Cowboys have shown absolutely nothing on offense since the loss of Ezekiel Elliott. But with the swing, I'm going to take the five extra points, and hope for the best.

New York Giants (+7.5) at Washington Redskins (Thursday, 8:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Redskins -7.5 The logic: The Giants won in dramatic, last-second fashion last weekend. The Redskins lost in dramatic, last-second fashion last weekend. Judging by the ebb-and-flow nature of NFL football, we'll play the Redskins this week.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers (+9.5) at Atlanta Falcons (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Buccaneers +9.5 The logic: The Buccaneers have won two straight games, and now all of a sudden are laying almost double digits. The Falcons have looked back to their old selves the past two weeks, but it was against depleted Cowboys and Seahawks teams. This line should be closer to six, and the extra points make Tampa Bay and enticing underdog pick.

Cleveland Browns (+8.5) at Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Browns +8.5 The logic: Gah. The Browns. The scourge of my existence. Every week I believe, and every week they let me down, last week in absolutely gut-wrenching fashion. But as big underdogs against a division rival that has hardly impressed with their play this season, we're doing it again. It's Thanksgiving, and betting on the Browns is my version of Charlie Brown believing that this is the time he's finally going to kick that football.

Tennessee Titans (-3.5) at Indianapolis Colts (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Titans -3.5 The logic: Road favorites are never an easy bet for me, but the Titans are still looking to solidify their spot in the postseason, and got embarrassed last week by the Steelers. This is a good spot for them to right the tailspin against a team they've already beaten by two touchdowns earlier in the year.

Buffalo Bills (+10) at Kansas City Chiefs (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Bills +10 The logic: After Nathan Peterman imploded for the Bills, Buffalo has returned the starting quarterback role to Tyrod Taylor, who will be looking to prove they never should have benched him in the first place. He will also be playing to impress any potential offseason suitors. The Chiefs have lost four of five games and do not look like a team that should be favored by double digits against anyone.

Miami Dolphins (+16) at New England Patriots (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Dolphins +16 The logic: Along with my addiction to betting on the Browns, I also have an uncontrollable urge to bet against the Patriots. It has lost me too much money to count over the course of my life. This stems from the fact that usually their lines break every conventional rule of gambling, as they do again here. This is the highest line of the year, and in the NFL, the rule is you blindly take any three-score underdog. The Patriots feel like they are unstoppable. They've punted just three times in the past two weeks on their way to winning both games by 25 points each. But like hitting on 16, you back the Dolphins in this spot because historically it's the right play, even if it feels psychotic.

Carolina Panthers (-4.5) at New York Jets (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Panthers -4.5 The logic: Panthers are trending up and the Jets are trending down. As much as I love a home dog, this isn't a game to overthink.

Chicago Bears (+13.5) at Philadelphia Eagles (Sunday, 1:00 p.m. ET) The pick: Eagles -13.5 The logic: The nervous Philadelphia fan inside me has made me hesitant to back the Birds once we were dubbed the best team in football. But after drubbing the Cowboys last week despite losing our kicker, beating a forlorn Bears team at home by two touchdowns feels like a safe bet. More than 80% of the bets are on the Eagles, making this a sucker bet to me as a person who does his best to abide by the rules of gambling. But I'm tired of betting against my team when they're rolling. Also, if the Eagles lose, it will be entirely my fault and I will wholly accept responsibility.

Seattle Seahawks (-6.5) at San Francisco 49ers (Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET) The pick: Seahawks -6.5 The logic: After their crushing loss to the Falcons on Monday night, the Seahawks now find themselves in a heated battle for a postseason spot in a crowded NFC. It's a lot of points to lay on the road against a divisional opponent, but this game means so much more to the Seahawks than the Niners. Until we get confirmation that Jimmy Garoppolo is making his San Francisco debut, they're not a team to think twice about betting against.

Denver Broncos (+5) at Oakland Raiders (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) The pick: Raiders -5 The logic: It was recently announced that Paxton Lynch would be taking over starting quarterback duties for the Broncos, and I can think of better places to make your first start of the season than the hostile haunts of Raider Nation. Both teams are falling apart, but I trust the Raiders more to put the pieces back together.

New Orleans Saints (+2.5) at Los Angeles Rams (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) The pick: Rams -2.5 The logic: With the Saints coming off a dramatic comeback and the Rams coming home after their first embarrassing loss of the season, this seems like a solid play to counter public perception. That said, if you've been waiting for the Rams to fall back down to Earth, this might be the time for you to cash in on your gut feeling.

Jacksonville Jaguars (-4.5) at Arizona Cardinals (Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET) The pick: Cardinals +4.5 The logic: "Blaine Gabbert revenge game!" is not a sentence I thought I would be excited to write at the start of this season, but here we are.

Green Bay Packers (+14) at Pittsburgh Steelers (Sunday, 8:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Packers +14 The logic: I know Hundley was bad last weekend, but this is a few too many points, and with 75% of bets currently on the Steelers, it's a good spot to fade the public.

Houston Texans (+7) at Baltimore Ravens (Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET) The pick: Ravens -7 The logic: This is a coin toss for my money, and probably a stay-away game for most people. But it's a home team with a solid defense against Tom Savage and needing a win to keep pace with the AFC Wild Card race. That's good enough for me. LAST WEEK: 8-5-1

Following is a transcript of the video.

Andrew Wittman: Back in — when I was deployed, I want to say 2010, 2011, coming up to where it was my 45th birthday, I wanted to see my abs. I'm reading all the studies on how you get your body to do that. There was a lot of research on intermittent fasting, and — course, they did the studies on soldiers. Thank you, US Army.

So they found out your body really doesn't go into starvation mode. You could go 3 weeks on 800 calories and you don't lose any muscle mass as long as you're working out. Well, I could do that. So I started the fasting, the intermittent fasting, consuming my calories between 4 o'clock in the afternoon, 8 o'clock at night, by 8 o'clock at night, I'm done. I don't eat again until 4 o'clock the next day at the earliest.

And during that time I will drink lots of water. I'll drink black coffee or unsweet tea, and that's pretty much it. I started in Kosovo — we deployed, I can tell you the dates. It was my wife's birthday, February 3. I got back on May the first, I think. I followed this routine for right about 3 months, 12 weeks, 90 days, and I saw my abs... Booyah.

American fighter James Toney fought three times at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and had a run-in with Trump when the president called him "Whatshisname."

Toney also says Trump is a "racist" because of the way activist and former NFL star Colin Kaepernick has been treated.



A former world champion boxer says he regrets not punching US president Donald Trump when he had the chance.

A decorated prizefighter, American boxer James Toney has notable victories over devastating puncher Michael Nunn, heavy hitter Mike McCallum, and former Olympic gold medalist Vassiliy Jirov.

But before Toney became a remowned fighter around the world, he was once on a show promoted by Donald Trump.

Speaking to Donald McRae in The Guardian, Toney recalled an incident when he was competing on the same event as headlining boxer Roy Jones Jr.

Toney took on Doug DeWitt, but before their super middleweight fight in 1992 at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, Trump called Toney "Whatsisname." The 49-year-old regrets not punching "him in the face."

He said: "Remember when he was a promoter and he had me and Roy [Jones] on the same bill in Atlantic City. I should’ve punched him in the face but my mom… stopped me."

"Trump pointed to me and was saying: 'Call Whatsisname over here.' I’m thinking: 'Whatsisname? I’m your headline attraction and you can’t say my name?' I said to Trump: 'I’m going to bust your head open, mother f*****.'"

Toney says he was "pulled away," but regrets not "knocking his head off and saving the world lots of trouble."

He also said that the treatment of former San Francisco 49ers quaterback Colin Kaepernick shows that Trump is "a racist."

Kaepernick protested police brutality against black Americans by bending a knee rather than standing for the pre-game US national anthem.

Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract in March 2017. He is currently a free agent and has not been signed by any NFL side.

Trump has been a vocal opponent of the take-a-knee movement and posted a series of tweets in September.

In an apparent reference to Kaepernick, Trump said that if a player protests the national anthem then club owners should "Get that son of a b**** off the field."

The Atlantic said Trump's war of words focused on "black athletes" like Kaepernick. The New Yorker also wrote an article about the "racial demagoguery of Trump's assault on Kaepernick."

Toney said: "[Trump is] the president but he’s a racist. That’s why Colin Kaepernick hasn’t got a job. Pure racism from Trump down."http://www.businessinsider.com/neymar-scored-2-goals-and-toyed-with-celtic-in-a-landslide-7-1-win-2017-11Neymar scored 2 goals and 'toyed' with Celtic in a landslide 7-1 win, then paid homage to Floyd Mayweather after the match3Neymar was at his brilliant best as the PSG forward scored twice, created a goal, and "toyed" with Celtic in his club's 7-1 win.

Rio Ferdinand said Neymar "put on a clinic of how to play exhilarating football" and that it was "a joy to watch."

Neymar spoke to journalists after the game and paid homage to retired boxer Floyd Mayweather by wearing the American's branded clothing.

Neymar scored twice in Paris Saint-Germain's magnificent 7-1 victory over Celtic.

The Ligue 1 leader fell behind due to an early Celtic goal but was merciless in its comeback as Neymar, Edison Cavani, Kylian Mbappé, Marco Veratti, and Dani Alves all piled the pressure onto the Scottish opponents.

Neymar scored two goals, created another, and played pitch-perfect 40-yard passes. According to BT Sport pundit Rio Ferdinand, Neymar was "toying" with Celtic.

He said: "Neymar put on a clinic of how to play exhilarating football. Speed. Totally toying with the opponents. And [the PSG team] is doing it all with a smile on its faces — it's a joy to watch."

Though it was a team effort and there were five different goalscorers in the dominant victory, Neymar played a part in many majestic PSG attacks. He was goalscorer, goal creator, and a creative force who played with a freedom of the pitch.

Even Ferdinand joked that PSG was "taking liberties" with people, reflecting how the club is brushing Champions League teams to the side.

PSG manager Unai Emery lauded Neymar. "He's extraordinary," Emery said, according to Goal.com. "He wants to play the games, to be present on the pitch. He makes everyone benefit from his talent."

Neymar fielded questions from journalists in the media zone after the match. Having previously been linked with a €200 million move to Real Madrid, one media member asked the Brazilian if he would consider leaving PSG.

Dressed in retired boxer Floyd Mayweather's branded clothing, Neymar slammed the reporter for being "boring" before walking away.

As it turns out, Leach has some extremely detailed advice for young men who are about to get married.

Leach has been married to his wife Sharon for 35 years.



Washington State head coach Mike Leach has a lot of thoughts on football, but while speaking with reporters on Tuesday night, he had even more to say about weddings.

After Leach was asked for advice from a reporter who is getting married in a few days, Leach's eyes wandered into a 1,000-yard stare, and then he went off.

"The women lose their mind," Leach said. "Your fiancee's gonna lose her mind, your mother-in-law is gonna lose her mind, your mom is gonna lose her mind, several of your sisters, and female relatives are gonna lose their mind. And, they're gonna barrage you with constant questions — 'what should we wear?' and of course my answer was 'I don't care.' And then 'what color should the invitations be?' 'I don't care.' 'What should we have for dessert?' 'I don't care.' 'Should we sit this way, or that way?' 'I don't care.'"

Leach, sounding like a man recalling old war stories he had buried in the depths of his memories, continued.

"But see, I don't care's not satisfactory at all, and you're going to get caught in a catch-22 — and I'm certain that you already have — and that catch-22 is, 'Well I want you to be a part of this too, so what color invitations?' 'Alright, the blue ones.' 'Well I kind of like the tan ones' — 'OK the tan ones then.' 'Oh you’re jut saying that because you want this over, you're not even thinking about it' — which is, of course, true.

Leach finished with a bit of advice that you could tell was earnest. "You need to find excuses that they'll buy to be as far out of harm's way as you possibly can."

You can watch the entirety of Leach's wedding advice unfold below.

Nassar is the former team doctor for the US gymnastics team and faces more than 25 years in prison.

He has been accused of sexual assault by over 125 women and girls, including members of the famed "Fierce Five" Olympic team.



LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A former doctor accused of molesting girls while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University pleaded guilty Wednesday to multiple charges of sexual assault and will face at least 25 years in prison.

Larry Nassar, 54, admitted to abusing seven girls, mostly under the guise of treatment at his Lansing-area home and a campus clinic. All but one of his accusers was a gymnast. He faces similar charges in a neighboring county and lawsuits filed by more than 125 women and girls. Nassar lost his license to practice medicine in April.

Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Gabby Douglas are among the women who have publicly said they were among Nassar's victims.

Some of his accusers attended the hearing Wednesday in a packed Ingham County courtroom. Some were crying.

"For all those involved ... I'm so horribly sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire out of control," Nassar said . "I pray the rosary every day for forgiveness. I want them to heal. I want the community to heal."

Nassar admitted to digitally penetrating the victims and agreed that his conduct had no legitimate medical purpose and that he did not have the girls' consent.

The plea deal in Ingham County calls for a minimum prison sentence of 25 years, but a judge could set the minimum sentence as high as 40 years. In Michigan, inmates are eligible for parole after serving a minimum sentence.

Sentencing was set for Jan. 12.

A prosecutor said 125 women and girls have filed complaints with Michigan State University police.

Judge Rosemarie Aquilina told Nassar: "You used your position of trust ... in the most vile way to abuse children. ... I agree that now is a time of healing, but it may take them a lifetime of healing while you spend your lifetime behind bars thinking about what you did in taking away their childhood."

She called the accusers "superheroes for all of America, because this is an epidemic."

The girls have testified that Nassar molested them with his hands, sometimes when a parent was present in the room, while they sought help for gymnastics injuries.

After the hearing, one of the accusers, Larissa Boyce, said it was "really hard" to look at Nassar in the courtroom.

"This was a man we trusted. He's admitting what he did was wrong and evil," she said.

Separately, Nassar is charged with similar crimes in Eaton County, the location of an elite gymnastics club. He also is awaiting sentencing in federal court on child pornography charges.

The Michigan criminal cases against Nassar followed reports last year in the Indianapolis Star about how USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians, mishandled complaints about sexual misconduct involving the doctor and coaches. Women and girls said the stories inspired them to step forward with detailed allegations of abuse, sometimes when their parents were in the exam room at Michigan State.http://www.businessinsider.com/mike-dantoni-offense-shaped-nba-2017-11The coach who designed the offense that changed the NBA nearly failed before he started3Mike D'Antoni is the architect behind the NBA's most popular style of offense.

D'Antoni's offensive philosophy was developed while playing in Italy, where he became a star after a forgettable NBA career.

D'Antoni has emphasized up-tempo offenses that rely on a heavy dose of three-pointers while playing smaller lineups.

D'Antoni's coaching career has taken many twists and turns, but he's left an undeniable footprint on the NBA.



The lightbulb went on for Mike D'Antoni in his third year coaching Olimpia Milano in the Italian basketball league LBA, though maybe it was always there and he had been ignoring it.

It was 1993 and D'Antoni was coaching "traditionally," as he calls it, but he wasn't getting much out of his team. D'Antoni decided to mix things up.

"I just one day just decided to do it the way I wanted to do it, and be damned the consequences," D'Antoni told Business Insider.

What followed were the seeds of a style of offense that would eventually sweep across the NBA. That year, Olimpia Milano won the FIBA Korac Cup, and D'Antoni's confidence in his preferred style of playing grew.

It was a style that D'Antoni did not invent, but helped popularize — up-tempo, spread-out offense with a reliance on pick-and-rolls and three-pointers that can be seen around the NBA today.

"There aren't many innovators in coaching," Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr told Business Insider. "There's usually a few key figures who change the way everybody else thinks ... I think what makes Mike unique is he is one of those innovators."

A forgotten NBA player, an Italian legend, a twice-failed NBA coach, a two-time NBA Coach of the Year, and an offensive innovator — all of these things describe D'Antoni.

'One of the lowest points of my life'

D'Antoni grew up in West Virginia and learned basketball under his father, Lewis, a successful high school basketball coach who influenced Mike's basketball philosophies.

After D'Antoni graduated from Marshall University in 1973, he was taken in the second round of the 1973 NBA draft by the Kansas City-Omaha Kings.

His NBA career was brief and forgettable. The 6-foot-3 shooting guard played three seasons with the Kings, never averaging more than the 19 minutes per game he played his rookie year. After one season with the Spirit of St. Louis and one with the San Antonio Spurs, he was cut and suddenly facing a crossroads.

"Probably one of the lowest points of my life," D'Antoni said of being cut. "I was 26 and not knowing whether I should go back to school and do something in the real world or continue playing basketball. You're kinda lost a little bit."

He eventually decided to take an offer to go play for Olimpia Milano in Italy.

"I think he had to," cackled D'Antoni's brother Dan D'Antoni, head coach of Marshall men's basketball and a former NBA assistant coach, to Business Insider. "It was a necessity."

"It was the best decision I ever made," Mike said.

D'Antoni became a star in Italy. Over the course of 13 years, he became the club's all-time leading scorer while leading Milan to five Italian league titles and two FIBA Euroleague titles. Olimpia Milano's website declared him "the greatest point-guard in the Italian basketball history."

After D'Antoni retired in 1990, he became head coach of Milan, leading the way to his offensive revelation.

An offense was born

Dan D'Antoni remembers when his brother began to change how he thought an offense should look. It was around 1979, when the NBA introduced the three-point line, and Mike called Dan on the phone to tell him how the number of threes attempted coincided with where teams finished in the Italian league. He noted that his own team, the league champions, shot and made the most threes.

Mike D'Antoni told his brother, "You might wanna start seeing how valuable that three-point line is."

Here's a simple version of how the D'Antoni offense works: Spread shooters around the floor and run a high pick-and-roll with the point guard and big man. With a 5-on-4 opportunity (with the opposing point guard blocked by the pick), the point guard can shoot, attack the basket, hit his big man rolling to the basket, or kick the ball out to any of his shooters. In almost any variation of the play, somebody is open and defenses are scrambling to recover. And it's even better to play this style at a fast pace.

Dan said this was a popular style in West Virginia growing up, and Don Nelson, the NBA's leader in career coaching wins, was known for running fast, "positionless" offenses.

D'Antoni didn't immediately impact the NBA with his vision. He was hired as head coach of the Denver Nuggets in 1998, but was fired after one season. He said he was still too scared to go against the grain and feared his resume was not strong enough to convince players to ditch normal post-ups and slow pace for three-pointers and fastbreaks.

D'Antoni worked as a scout for the Spurs afterward and later as an assistant for the Portland Trail Blazers. He returned to Europe to coach Benetton Trevisio in 2001-02 and once again found success coaching his style of offense. That success caught the eyes of Phoenix Suns CEO Jerry Colangelo. D'Antoni became head coach of the Suns in 2003-04, replacing fired head coach Frank Johnson and was kept on board for the 2004-05 season.

Seven seconds or less

In the Colangelos, D'Antoni found management that supported his vision. And the key to his vision was the acquisition of All-Star point guard Steve Nash, who gave D'Antoni the engine to his offense. D'Antoni moved Amar'e Stoudemire, an explosive power forward, to center. Around this dynamic pick-and-roll duo, D'Antoni unleashed three sharpshooting, athletic wings, a rare structure at the time.

The run-and-gun Suns went 62-20 during the 2004-05 season as D'Antoni won Coach of the Year and Nash won MVP. The "seven seconds or less" Suns — a term used to describe the pace of their offense — went 170-76 over the next three seasons, with Nash winning a second MVP in 2005-06.

"That was, to me, the beginning of the shift in the NBA in terms of how teams were gonna play," said Kerr, who was an advisor with the Suns and became GM in 2007.

"Mike was the first guy to really just downsize and just makes his threes into fours and fours into fives and just not play a traditional center. And as a result, to me, that was the beginning shift that you're seeing now, 13 years later."

Repeated playoff failures, however, wore on the team. Twice they made it to the Western Conference Finals and lost in excruciating fashion. Concerns arose about the Suns' commitment to defense, and the logic of playing smaller and shooting a high number of jump shots was questioned.

In 2008, Kerr, then the general manager, swung a trade for Shaquille O'Neal in an attempt to get bigger, compromising the team's identity.

"In hindsight it was a mistake," Kerr said.

D'Antoni left after the 07-08 season, in which the Suns went 55-27, but lost in the first round to the San Antonio Spurs.

Pit stops in New York and Los Angeles

Stubbornness, ill-equipped rosters, and bad timing plagued D'Antoni in stops with the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers. D'Antoni continued to push his offensive style on rosters that didn't have the make-up of his teams in Phoenix. In New York, he was reunited with Stoudemire, but had a hard time getting Carmelo Anthony to buy in to his vision. In Los Angeles, he was reunited with Nash, but couldn't sell Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol on their roles.

Meanwhile, concerns remained about his style and his commitment to defense.

"Innovators tend to be very headstrong, otherwise they wouldn’t be innovators," said Kerr. "They really believe in something that most other people don’t believe in. I think there’s a psychology to it where the only way to be successful is to be really prideful and persistent on what you’re doing."

Mike called himself spiritually richer for the experiences in New York and LA, but one gets the sense he remains resolute in his ways.

"I mean, there's always things you'd do differently," he said, but added there's no proof that playing differently would have changed the outcomes in New York and Los Angeles — just two playoff berths over six years.

However, Mike also understood the hesitancy of some star players to buy into his scheme.

"Some years you're paying players $20, $30 million and then you [tell] them, 'Well what you were doing to earn all that money is completely gone.' That’s tough," D'Antoni said, laughing. "So, if they don’t have the inclination that makes it tough."

After D'Antoni resigned as Lakers head coach in 2014 following a franchise-worst 27-55 season, doubts about him as a coach were stronger than ever. Perhaps his success in Phoenix had been unique to that team.

The Warriors revolution

"Thank goodness for Golden State," D'Antoni says now.

In 2014, D'Antoni was away from the NBA for the first time in years. He had returned to West Virginia and spent his days golfing, reading, and hanging out with his dad and his family. At night, however, he couldn't help turning on the TV to watch a dynamo that looked awfully familiar, run by a former colleague.

The Kerr-led Warriors were like D'Antoni's Suns — on steroids. Stephen Curry was in the Steve Nash role, but was quicker and more deadly of a shooter. The Warriors pushed the pace and spread the floor with shooters, cutters, and defenders in Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, and Andre Iguodala. And more importantly, they had playmaking and defensive big men in Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut, something D'Antoni never had much of in Phoenix. The Warriors played like a souped-up Suns, and D'Antoni loved it. He found joy in the Warriors winning the 2014-15 championship.

"I think the biggest thing was when Steve and [the Warriors] won the championship," Dan D'Antoni said of his brother. "He relaxed. He goes, 'My point has been made. I didn’t make it, but somebody else made it.'"

Kerr disputes how similar the two systems really are. D'Antoni offenses focus heavily on high pick-and-rolls, and the best player controls the ball, picking out teammates like a quarterback finding receivers. Kerr's Warriors actually run some of the fewest pick-and-rolls in the league, and Curry, despite being the engine of the offense, spends a great deal of time off the ball.

"I think our philosophy of pace and three-point shooting was something that I definitely agreed with and Mike had sort of set the tone in terms of the way he was playing with his teams," Kerr said, adding, "We took elements of Mike's offense and implemented those elements into a bigger system that was more our own."

A Rockets renaissance

D'Antoni made his return to the NBA in 2016 as head coach of the Houston Rockets. In Houston GM Daryl Morey, D'Antoni found a kindred spirit. Morey's basketball philosophy is analytically driven — three-pointers, layups, and free throws are basketball's most efficient shots. Throw out midrange jumpers, deep twos, and post-ups; there are better shots to be taken. The two systems align.

In Rockets guard James Harden, D'Antoni had a new Nash in-waiting. D'Antoni thought he could tweak Harden's playing style, and he was right. He unleashed Harden at point guard in 2016-17, and the results were immediate: the Rockets won 55 games and made the semifinals. Harden, meanwhile, had a career year and finished second in MVP voting.

In the offseason, the Rockets took it a step further, adding Chris Paul to the back-court after a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers. This season, D'Antoni is facing a somewhat familiar challenge — blending in two ball-dominant stars whose games may not necessarily complement each other.

D'Antoni's approach for blending Paul and Harden could be seen as a sign of growth. Paul has historically been a slow-it-down guard who prods the defense and dictates the offense. His game is more midrange heavy than typical D'Antoni player.

"You gotta be Chris Paul," D'Antoni said of his approach to coaching Paul. "I can't just say I wanna take a Hall of Fame point guard and make him into something else."

D'Antoni's offense still has some doubters, but turn on an NBA game on any given night and his influence can be seen. Teams across the league have downsized and turned away from traditional big men, preferring the spacing and quickness smaller players provide. Call it "The Warriors effect," but it wouldn't have been possible without D'Antoni.

D'Antoni still thinks there's room for his offensive approach to grow. Players can now play even faster, he said, because the science around health has improved. His Rockets team frequently takes three-pointers well beyond the three-point line because it spreads the floor even more — he thinks there's room to keep pushing that, too.

He doesn't know who or what will be the next innovation in the NBA. But eventually, someone will come along and change the league, just as he did in 2004.

A telling sign about the D'Antoni impact on the game — the 2004-05 Suns led the league in pace. Today, at that same pace, they would rank 22nd in the NBA.

"In another ten years, we won't even be on the same page," D'Antoni said.http://www.businessinsider.com/jerry-jones-backs-off-threats-to-sue-fellow-nfl-owners-2017-11Jerry Jones backs off threats to sue fellow NFL owners-3Jerry Jones has walked back his initial threats to sue the NFL and his fellow owners in a letter sent to Falcons owner Arthur Blank.

Jones argued that he just wanted to ensure that owners who were not a part of the NFL's compensation committee had an opportunity to be heard before Roger Goodell's extension as commissioner went forward.

Jones also denied again that his attacks on Goodell were in any way related to the suspension of Ezekiel Elliott.



Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has walked back his threats to sue his fellow NFL owners.

As Ken Belson of the New York Times reports, Jones took a different tone in a letter sent to Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons and chairman of the NFL's compensation committee who has been described as the "point man" on negotiating Goodell's extension.

In the letter, Jones said that his threats of legal action were an effort to ensure that all owners had "a voice in approving the terms" of Goodell's contract extension, rather than those with a vote on the compensation committee. "With the committee now receiving valuable feedback from a number of owners," Jones said, he is "standing down from my threat of litigation against the committee," according to the Times.

Jones has been a vocal advocate against extending Goodell's contract as commissioner, and had initially threatened a lawsuit against both the league and individual owners in an effort to delay the process. But after a back and forth with the league that included threats of a "nuclear option" that might force Jones to sell the Cowboys, Jones is now backing off his initial bluster.

Jones also repeated in the letter that his fight against Goodell had nothing to do with suspension of star Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott.

With the letter, Jones presents football fans first signal that the circus surrounding Goodell's extension might be finally coming to a sane conclusion.http://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-fund-billionaire-luxury-golf-trip-new-zealand-tiger-tour-2017-11People are lining up to pay $28,500 for a billionaire's 'Tiger Tour' of New Zealand golf, spas, and wildlife3Legendary hedge fund manager Julian Roberston put together one of the most luxurious golfing vacations in his beloved New Zealand.

On the Tiger Tour, vacationers can see both New Zealand's North and South Islands over the course of nine nights on Roberston's three properties.

The itinerary includes golfing, sightseeing, and spa treatments. Legendary hedge fund manager and multi-billionaire Julian Roberston put together one of the most luxurious golfing vacations in his beloved New Zealand — and we got the inside look. On the Tiger Tour, vacationers can see both New Zealand's North and South Islands over the course of nine nights on Roberston's three properties: The Lodge at Kauri Cliffs, The Farm at Cape Kidnappers, and Matakauri Lodge. Roberston, 85, a pioneer of the modern hedge fund industry, is best known for founding the investment firm Tiger Management Corp, one of the earliest funds, in 1980. After closing his fund in 2000, many of Robertson's proteges went on to start some of the world's largest hedge funds, such as Lone Pine and Viking Global. His net worth is estimated at $4.1 billion, according to Forbes. The Tiger Tour is currently going on from November 17-26, 2017, but there's another tour coming up March 1-10, 2018. The tour is limited to four couples at $28,500 per person, plus taxes, and not including international airfare and other expenses. View As: One Page Slides

The first stop is at The Lodge at Kauri Cliffs.

Here's an aerial view of the property and golf course.

The lodging at the resort has spectacular views. Not a bad spot for lounging.

The golf course, designed by David Harman, is ranked among the Top 100 in the world. The first full day at Kauri features 18 holes of golf on this course.

Aside from golf, there's also a spa set deep in the forest.

You can go on a quad-biking adventure around the property.

And enjoy some New Zealand wine with a view.

The Farm at Cape Kidnappers, located in the heart of Hawke's Bay Wine Country, is the second stop on the trip.

Here's what the lodge looks like.

The rooms here also have nice views.

This leg of the trip also has an 18-hole golf course, designed by Tom Doak.

After playing a round of golf, you can interact with the kiwi bird — one of the national symbols of New Zealand.

Other activities include Clay Target shooting.

And you can enjoy a nice picnic on the property, as well.

The trip concludes at the Matakauri Lodge, situated on the shores of Lake Wakatipu.

You'll be able to see mountains from your room.

There's a helicopter trip to explore the heart of the Fiordland, which flies over the mountains and beautiful scenery.

In a tweet early Wednesday morning, Trump called out the "highly paid Commissioner" and told him to get "tough and smart."



President Donald Trump rekindled his feud with the NFL on Wednesday morning in an early morning tweet calling out both the league and its commissioner.

"The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That’s almost as bad as kneeling!" the president tweeted. "When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!....."

Trump's comments on the league and its commissioner come in the midst of ongoing negotiations between Roger Goodell and the NFL, and a looming legal battle with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

Trump had previously criticized the ongoing player protests of police brutality and systemic racism during the national anthem, and called players that participated in such efforts "sons of b------" that deserved to be fired, inspiring players and owners alike to respond with widespread protests the following Sunday. While his furor with the players seemed to have died down in recent weeks, he brought back his war with the league this past weekend after Marshawn Lynch sat out the anthem, but stood for the Mexican anthem while playing in Mexico City.

The practice of staying in the locker room durinmg the anthem is not a new concept in football. Most college football teams stay in the locker room while the home team's marching band plays the anthem. Additionally, the NFL did not require players to appear on the sidelines for the anthem until 2009. Should the NFL choose not to require players to be present on the sidelines for the anthem, it would be a reversion to a previous policy, not something radically new.

Regardless of how the process plays out, chances are President Trump will have something to say about it, and he'll let the American public know his feelings through his Twitter account. Since his return from his trip to Asia, Trump has been on something of a tear of sports tweets, and has shown no signs on slowing.http://www.businessinsider.com/lavar-ball-lakers-coaching-lonzo-ball-criticism-2017-115 months after LaVar Ball said he would be hands-off with the Lakers, he is questioning their handling of Lonzo Ball-3Lonzo Ball has been struggling with his shot in the NBA and has sat on the bench late in some games.

LaVar Ball, who had previously said he would not intervene with the Los Angeles Lakers' coaching of Lonzo, said the team is "babying" Lonzo and not coaching him properly.

While LaVar did not specifically criticize Luke Walton, it can't be a welcomed development for Lakers coaches.



Amid the ongoing feud between LaVar Ball and President Donald Trump, a concern has risen for the Los Angeles Lakers: when LaVar isn't going back at Trump, he's criticizing the Lakers' coaching.

When the Lakers took LaVar's son Lonzo Ball with the second pick in the draft, it came after LaVar told Lakers president Magic Johnson that he would be hands-off with the team and his son.

"He said, 'Earvin, look, I'm not following my son. I'm not going to be hanging out in L.A. I'm going to be training these young kids [his other sons],'" Johnson told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.

LaVar said he told Johnson, "'As far as training my boy, this is as far as I can take him. I'll leave it up to you to take him further.'"

However, as Lonzo has struggled mightily with his shot and consistency in the NBA, at times sitting out late in games, LaVar has grown impatient with Lakers coach Luke Walton. LaVar told Bleacher Report's Eric Pincus that the Lakers are "soft" on Lonzo.

"He's been away from me too long. I see tendencies in his game — they're trying to baby him a little bit ... They're soft. They don't know how to coach my son. I know how to coach him. I tell him to go get the victory. Stop messing around."

Asked if he had a problem with Walton, LaVar told Pincus, "No, I have a problem with losing."

The Lakers are 8-10 and Lonzo has shot just 30.8% from the field, 23% from three while averaging 8.9 points per game. While he leads the team in assists and has contributed in rebounding, Ball's shooting woes have been cause for concern in LA. Compared to LaVar, however, Walton has taken the calm route, saying every game is a learning experience.

LaVar criticized that mentality:

"What I mean by babying [Lonzo], 'He'll figure it out.' It ain't about that. 'Be patient with him?' Ain't no patience if you're winning."

"They're letting it go too easy, saying they're a young team. Forget about that! Put the [onus] on them. Say, 'You guys need to win. You've got enough talent. Win some games.'"

The Lakers can't be thrilled with this development, and it can't make things any easier on Lonzo, who now has two prominent voices in his ears telling him different things.

Intervening sports parents are nothing new, but few command the media attention and hype as LaVar — who, again, is in a spat with the president. LaVar's boisterous and overbearing style has already drawn other players to go after Lonzo and play harder than usual.

Walton is preaching patience, but it may be worth watching how he handles critiques from the outside, especially from someone who said they would lay off.http://www.businessinsider.com/lavar-ball-and-the-ball-family-inside-their-rapid-rise-2017-11Inside the rapid rise of the Ball family: How a former athlete trained 3 potential NBA players and became the most hated man in basketball-3NBA rookies Ben Simmons and Jayson Tatum have been impressive in their first professional season, but if there's one newcomer who has left his mark on the American basketball scene, it's LaVar Ball. After falling short in his own quest to attain fame as a professional athlete, Ball made it his life's mission to get his three sons to the NBA. So far, the plan has worked — the oldest, Lonzo Ball, is a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, and his younger brothers may follow behind him. Intense training is one aspect of Ball's strategy to vault his sons into superstardom, but so is attention-seeking behavior. Over the past year, he has made numerous inflammatory comments, sparred with some of the game's foremost figures, and drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, all while relentlessly promoting his business venture: Big Baller Brand. Below, read up on the rapid rise of one of the most intriguing families in all of sports. View As: One Page Slides

Despite having less than a season's worth of NBA experience between them, the Balls have become some of the biggest names in basketball.

There's Lonzo Ball, the second overall pick in the 2017 draft and rookie point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers...

...LiAngelo Ball, a freshman guard at UCLA...

...and LaMelo Ball, who was recently pulled out of Chino Hills High School in California in favor of an intense training and a homeschooling regimen.

Then there's the patriarch and the architect of the family's fame: LaVar Ball.

LaVar was a multi-sport athlete growing up. He played basketball at Washington State during the 1987-88 season, averaging 2.2 points per game. He also played for West Los Angeles College and Cal State Los Angeles.

LaVar and Tina had LiAngelo in 1998, followed by LaMelo in 2001. Each of their sons began training with LaVar before reaching preschool.

And train them he did. Lonzo did his first pull-up at age 4 and began doing sprints up mile-long hills at age 12. Source: Stack

"I started introducing my boys [to working out] when they were 4 or 5 years old, doing pull-ups and dips and hanging on the bars for fun," LaVar said. "They was into it because they would see who could do one, and then the other one would try and do two, and as they got older, they'd say 'Dad, let me go in there, I can do them by myself.' It was like a competition thing for all of them." Source: Stack

In addition to pushing them to their physical limits, LaVar instilled in his sons the confidence necessary to succeed in professional sports. He would tell them, "Your mom’s a PE teacher. I’m a trainer. She’s big. I’m big. You guys are big. Your last name is Ball. What else you gonna do?" Source: GQ

The boys showed promise from an early age. "When the boys were seven, nine, and ten, they’d play against the eighth graders and they’d run ’em into the ground," he told Los Angeles Magazine. "Soon kids would want them to sign their backpacks or their basketballs." Source: Los Angeles Magazine

Their work eventually paid off in a big way, as all three Ball sons became high school and AAU phenoms. Lonzo and LiAngelo committed to UCLA after their sophomore years, while LaMelo did so the summer after leaving middle school. Source: Los Angeles Magazine

That fall, Lonzo headed off to UCLA as a prominent prospect. He had a solid season, averaging 14.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.6 assists in just over 35 minutes per game. Despite a bizarre shooting motion, he made over 55% of his shots from the field.

While Lonzo put himself on the map with his productive play, LaVar's outspoken nature and penchant for exaggeration earned him a reputation as a master promoter.

In February 2017, LaMelo, then a high school sophomore, scored 92 points on 61 shots in a Chino Hills victory. LaVar was proud. "He loves to score," he told ESPN. "That's the type of things he's going to do next year on a daily basis. It's easy for him." Source: ESPN

The outsized stat line drew a number of reactions, including a negative one from Charles Barkley. "You know, the kid was waiting at half court most of the game. Never went back on defense. So I had a problem with it, to be honest with you," he said. Source: Mike & Mike

In March, LaVar took his trash talk to the next level, confidently asserting that he could outplay one of the greatest players to ever take the court. "Back in my heyday, I would kill Michael Jordan one-on-one...He better make every shot ’cause he can’t go around me," he said. "He’s not fast enough." Source: USA Today

Jordan responded, saying, "You've got to understand the source...I don't think he could beat me if I was one-legged." Read more: Michael Jordan responds to LaVar Ball: 'I don’t think he could beat me if I was one-legged'

In college, Lonzo led the Bruins to a 29-4 record, good for a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament. But he was flummoxed by eventual rookie classmate De'Aaron Fox and the Kentucky Wildcats in the Sweet 16, and UCLA lost 86-75.

Soon after, Lonzo declared for the 2017 NBA draft in a widely anticipated move. For months, LaVar had been predicting that his eldest son would go to his hometown Los Angeles Lakers, telling ESPN that "I'm going to speak it into existence." Source: ESPN

Speculation surged when Los Angeles left the draft lottery with the second overall pick. The Washington guard Markelle Fultz was the consensus No. 1, meaning the Lakers would get their pick of the remaining litter.

On draft night, the Lakers took Lonzo with their top pick, fulfilling LaVar's prophecy. Less than a month later, they traded their incumbent point guard, the former No. 2 pick D'Angelo Russell, to the Brooklyn Nets, signaling a full commitment to Lonzo.

All the while, LaVar was touting his latest business venture: Big Baller Brand.

Big Baller Brand was launched in 2016 as a sports apparel and lifestyle company. In May of this year, LaVar announced that basketball fans could buy a pair of Lonzo's signature shoes, the ZO2s — for the low price of $495. Source: Big Baller Brand

People were outraged at what appeared to be a display of unfettered greed. LaVar defended the shoes on Twitter, saying, "If you can't afford the ZO2'S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER!" Source: Twitter

Shaq had a great response: "real big baller brands don't over charge kids for shoes." Source: Twitter

LaVar continued his antics over the summer. In June, he appeared alongside Lonzo and LaMelo on an episode of "WWE Monday Night Raw." Read more: LaVar Ball made his WWE debut and it was just as crazy as you would imagine

But in addition to controversy in the ring, there was controversy on the court. With thousands of fans in the stands, LaVar pulled his AAU team off the court after being called for a technical and cussing at the referee. Read more: LaVar Ball took his AAU team off the court and forfeited a game after getting called for a technical foul

Weeks later, LaVar pulled LaMelo out of Chino Hills over disagreements with the school's new basketball coach. Read more: LaVar Ball is pulling youngest son LaMelo out of high school after disputes with new coach



While LaVar has helped his sons in many ways, he has hindered them in others. In Lonzo's NBA debut against the Los Angeles Clippers, he was shut down and taunted by Patrick Beverley. "I just had to set the tone. I told him after the game that due to all the riffraff his dad brings, that he's going to get a lot of people coming at him," Beverley said.

In November, it was LiAngelo's turn to make headlines.

While on a visit to Beijing, President Donald Trump asked the Chinese president Xi Jinping to intervene in the case. Days later, the players were headed home. Read more: Trump asked the Chinese government to intervene in the case involving UCLA basketball players arrested in China

Trump took to Twitter to wonder if the players would thank him, and while LiAngelo did just that, LaVar dismissed the president's help. "Maybe we were doing some talking with some other people before he even got there," he told Fox News. "There is a lot of other matters going around for the president to deal with that's political. As far as me, let me deal with my son." Read more: CNN interview with LaVar Ball goes off the rails as he tries to explain why he dismissed Trump's help

In a year when he feuded with everyone from Michael Jordan to Stephen A. Smith, sparring with Trump was the icing on the cake. The president even sent a series of tweets about LaVar.

But despite his brash public persona, there is another side to LaVar. For one thing, his devotion to his family is undeniable.

LaVar isn't finished making headlines. In June, he told ESPN that his plan is to have LiAngelo declare for the 2018 draft, go unselected, and join Lonzo with the Lakers as a rookie free agent.

As for Lonzo, he's keeping his head above water in his first NBA season, averaging 7.1 assists in 33.1 minutes per game for a Lakers on pace for an eight-win improvement.

Between the dominant performances on the court, the self-inflicted controversies, and the public feuds with just about everyone, it's been an interesting year for the Ball family...http://www.businessinsider.com/wigan-athletic-player-ryan-colclough-scored-twice-then-rushed-to-hospital-to-witness-the-birth-of-his-son-2017-11An English footballer scored 2 goals then ran off the pitch because his wife was giving birth7Wigan Athletic striker Ryan Colclough scored twice in his club's 3-0 victory over Doncaster on Tuesday.

An English footballer scored two goals in a League One match, then ran off the pitch in the 60th minute to get to the hospital in time to witness the birth of his son.

Wigan Athletic striker Ryan Colclough produced his best performance of the season in his club's 3-0 victory over Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday.

Wigan gained a 1-0 advantage in the 40th minute when Joe Wright scored an own goal. The team then doubled its lead through Colclough just before the half-time break.

In the 58th minute, the 22-year-old scored his second goal of the game. Then, just two minutes later, he was substituted.

But rather than take his seat on the bench and watch the rest of the game, Cloclough ran down the tunnel and rushed straight to hospital to witness a crucial life milestone — the birth of his son.

What's more, he didn't have time to change. As the photograph below demonstrates, the first time he met his baby, Cloclough was still in his club colours — including his football socks.

Trump called him an "ungrateful fool" and compared him to Don King without the hair.

Trump has been criticized in the past for finding athletes ungrateful, and after the UCLA players did thank Trump, Trump asked them to thank Chinese President Xi Jinping too.



President Donald Trump blasted NBA personality LaVar Ball on Wednesday with tweets calling an "ungrateful fool" and saying his son LiAngelo would have been in jail in China without his help.

The outburst followed a bizarre CNN interview in which Ball refused to thank Trump for his help.

On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted "It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME."

He went on to say, " LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair" and that LaVar "could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China."

Though LiAngelo and the other UCLA freshman basketball players detained for shoplifting in China did thank Trump for his help, Ball disputed that Trump purposefully tried to free the students during 12-day trip to Asia.

He also criticized the president for not bringing them back on Air Force One.

The freshman admitted to stealing from stores in China that reportedly included a Louis Vuitton outlet. In China, people convicted of shoplifting face up to 10 years in prison.

"LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China" tweeted Trump, who also called Ball a "poor man's version of Don King, but without the hair" in reference to the scandal-ridden boxing promoter who is known to promote fights with sensational claims and an iconic hairdo.

King, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 1967, stumped for Trump during the campaign, and the two have referred to each other as friends in the past.

Trump has been criticized for finding athletes ungrateful in the past, as he routinely attacks NFL players for sitting during the national anthem.

After the UCLA players thanked Trump for his help, Trump went a step further and asked the players to also thank Chinese President Xi Jinping.
